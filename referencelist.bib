  abstractnote = {Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (aTTP) is a rare disease with diverse clinical manifestations, including fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological symptoms, and acute renal impairment. First identified and described in 1924, today the pathophysiological aspects that distinguish it from other thrombotic vasculopathies and serve as targets for innovative therapies are known. TTP is divided into inherited and acquired forms. The acquired form can be idiopathic or secondary. The current classification of the World Health Organization defines TTP in the category of thrombotic microangiopathies. Studying the epidemiology of aTTP is challenging due to several objective factors. The disease is characterized by a specific laboratory immunologic panel, which is often technically unavailable for many clinical centers. The presence of severe clinical presentations, often accompanied by comorbidities and rapid fatal progression, is also a barrier to establishing the true prevalence of the disease. This publication aims to analyze epidemiological data for aTTP and provide an assessment of the prevalence of this condition in Bulgaria.},

  abstractnote = {Since 72% of rare diseases are genetic in origin and mostly paediatrics, genetic newborn screening represents a diagnostic “window of opportunity”. Therefore, many gNBS initiatives started in different European countries. Screen4Care is a research project, which resulted of a joint effort between the European Union Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. It focuses on genetic newborn screening and artificial intelligence-based tools which will be applied to a large European population of about 25.000 infants. The neonatal screening strategy will be based on targeted sequencing, while whole genome sequencing will be offered to all enrolled infants who may show early symptoms but have resulted negative at the targeted sequencing-based newborn screening. We will leverage artificial intelligence-based algorithms to identify patients using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and to build a repository “symptom checkers” for patients and healthcare providers. S4C will design an equitable, ethical, and sustainable framework for genetic newborn screening and new digital tools, corroborated by a large workout where legal, ethical, and social complexities will be addressed with the intent of making the framework highly and flexibly translatable into the diverse European health systems.},

However, the inclusion of all types of cancer in a single category in health policy development has been criticized. Due to their clinical and epidemiological characteristics, patients with rare tumors face greater barriers in accessing innovative medications, combined with a lack of expertise in the diagnostic and therapeutic process. The development of separate policies for these patients requires a precise definition of the concept.
                  This review aims to present the chronological development of defining the concept of rare tumors in the context of building health policies in this area. For the purposes of the review, a search was conducted using keywords "rare cancers," "rare tumors," and "rare neoplasm" in the PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases, as well as Google Scholar. The articles found are organized into three main contexts of using the term "rare tumors" – clinically based definitions; definitions based on epidemiological criteria; and definitions used in pediatric oncology.},

Despite their promising potential, challenges such as uncertainty regarding long-term health benefits and safety, along with extreme price tags, pose significant obstacles to patient access. Within the EU, the European Medicines Agency plays a pivotal role with regards to GT market authorization. However, national authorities are responsible for pricing and reimbursement, which results in fragment patient access within the EU. This study aimed to provide an overview of the complex landscape of post-market authorization accessibility for GT products in Bulgaria, comparing it with neighboring EU countries. We applied a mixed-methods approach, including desk research, public data requests, and list price comparisons. As of 1 April 2023, 14 GTs had a valid market authorization at the EU level. In Bulgaria, Kymriah® was the only GT included in the Positive Drug List (PDL), with an official list price of EUR 335,636.94. Similar results were found in Romania, whereas five GTs were included in Greece’s PDL. Additionally, Zolgensma® was found accessible in Bulgaria through an alternative individual access scheme at an estimated price of EUR 1,945,000.00. In conclusion, this study emphasized targeted policy interventions to address health inequalities and to ensure timely access to GTs within the EU.},

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of healthcare providers with expertise in rare cancers regarding the effectiveness of enacted or planned rare cancer policies across Europe. Between 25 March 2023 and 5 March 2024, we conducted an online survey targeting 738 healthcare providers affiliated with the European Reference Networks and the Organization of European Cancer Institutes, yielding 92 complete responses from 28 European countries (response rate: 12.5%). While a significant portion of respondents were unaware of their country’s legal definitions for rare cancers, 67.4% acknowledged that national cancer plans prioritized rare cancers. These plans received the highest ratings for their evidence-based interventions and monitoring efforts. The integration of rare cancer policies into broader oncology frameworks was the preferred policy model. National cancer registries were highly rated for confidentiality and validity but scored the lowest for cost-effectiveness. Government funding was deemed crucial for cancer screening programs. The disease burden and unmet health needs primarily influenced reimbursement decisions in the field of rare cancers. Respondents rated palliative care as more effective in adults with rare cancers compared to in children, particularly regarding symptom management. We confirmed significant variability in rare cancer policy evaluations across Europe, the necessity for a common EU-level definition for rare cancers, and a shift in reimbursement and policy framework models, highlighting the importance of policy integration and enhanced collaboration. However, given the limitations of the study, such as small sample size and possible unstudied confounding factors, we should interpret our findings with caution. A systematic policy review and multistakeholder assessment in the future could complement our results.},

We evaluated and summed up all costs for health services (diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and rehabilitation), educational and social services, and formal and informal care in the community, as well as indirect costs due to the loss of productivity and work capacity of the SMA patients’ caregivers. Results: Nine parents of SMA patients provided consent and completed the study’s questionnaire. Two children had SMA type III, and seven had SMA type II. The median annual socio-economic burden per SMA patient was EUR 254,968.80. The high direct costs, primarily driven by drug expenses, and the substantial indirect costs resulting from the loss of productivity among informal caregivers were the primary causes. We found no utilization of social care and educational services. Conclusions: We emphasize the need for careful consideration of long-term outcomes, real-world data collection, and performance-based reimbursement. An ideal scenario could achieve these objectives in synergy. A second layer of policy actions and measures must address the unmet needs of SMA patients and their families using a holistic approach. The indirect costs associated with SMA, particularly the productivity loss of informal caregivers, underscore the need for comprehensive support programs.},

In Bulgaria, these challenges are compounded by limited resources, fragmented care, and outdated policies. This study investigates policy stakeholder perspectives to identify gaps and propose policy alternatives for rare cancer care in Bulgaria, with implications for the broader European Union (EU) context. A grounded theory qualitative research design was employed to explore stakeholder insights. Eight key stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, patient advocates, and pharmaceutical representatives, participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed through thematic coding to map policy gaps and develop viable alternatives. Stakeholders highlighted significant gaps in funding, access to innovative therapies, and care organization. Four policy approaches emerged: Liberal, advocating for inclusivity and decentralized care; Conservative, emphasizing cost control and centralization; Balanced, integrating elements of both; and Status Quo, retaining the current system. While centered on Bulgaria, these findings address universal challenges in rare cancer care, offering a framework adaptable to other EU countries. Adopting tailored policies can reduce disparities, improve patient outcomes, and align national strategies with EU objectives, particularly under Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan and the EU Cancer Mission.},

Addressing these issues requires innovative, cost-effective strategies, with schools serving as critical platforms for mental health promotion. This study evaluates the impact of an online training program, Well@School, designed to enhance Mental Health Literacy (MHL) among primary school professionals in Finland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Greece. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design with pre- and post-test assessments, the study involved 223 health, education, and social care professionals. The revised Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) was employed to measure changes in MHL. Results indicated a significant positive effect, with an average increase of 4 points (2.5%) in MHLS scores post-course. Bayesian analysis further confirmed this improvement, showing a high probability (99.92%) of a positive impact, with the most likely gain ranging between 3 and 5 points. The findings underscore the potential of online training programs to enhance MHL among school professionals, thereby improving their capacity to support students’ mental health. This study highlights the importance of equipping primary school staff with the necessary skills to recognize and address mental health challenges, reduce stigma, and foster a supportive school environment.},

  abstractnote = {Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common hospital- and community-acquired infections, creating a substantial healthcare burden due to recurrence, complications, and rising antimicrobial resistance. Accurate diagnosis and timely antimicrobial therapy are essential. This study aimed to identify trends in the etiology, treatment, and resistance patterns of UTIs through a retrospective analysis of urine isolates processed at the Laboratory of Microbiology at University Hospital St. George in Plovdiv, the largest tertiary care and reference microbiology center in Bulgaria, between 2017 and 2022. Materials and Methods: A retrospective single-center study was performed at the hospital’s Microbiology Laboratory. During the study period, 74,417 urine samples from 25,087 hospitalized patients were screened with the HB&L UROQUATTRO system. Positive specimens were cultured on blood agar, Eosin-Methylene Blue, and chromogenic media. Identification was performed using biochemical assays, MALDI-TOF MS, and the Vitek 2 Compact system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing included disk diffusion, MIC determination, broth microdilution (for colistin), and Vitek 2 Compact, interpreted according to EUCAST standards. Descriptive analysis and temporal resistance trends were evaluated with regression models, and interrupted time-series analysis was applied to assess COVID-19-related effects. Results: Out of 10,177 isolates, Gram-negative bacteria predominated (73%), with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis as the leading pathogens. Among Gram-positives, Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent. In the post-COVID-19 period, ESBL production increased in E. coli (34–38%), K. pneumoniae (66–77%), and P. mirabilis (13.5–24%). Carbapenem resistance rose in K. pneumoniae (to 40.6%) and P. aeruginosa (to 24%), while none was detected in E. coli. Colistin resistance increased in K. pneumoniae but remained absent in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. High-level aminoglycoside resistance in E. faecalis was stable (~70%), and vancomycin resistance in E. faecium rose from 4.6% to 8.9%. Conclusions: Both community- and hospital-acquired UTIs in Southeastern Bulgaria are increasingly linked to multidrug-resistant pathogens, particularly ESBL-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Findings from the region’s largest referral center highlight the urgent need for continuous surveillance, rational antibiotic use, and novel therapeutic approaches.},

  abstractnote = {Background/Objectives: Orphan medicinal products offer essential treatments for rare diseases, but patient access varies across European Union countries despite a common regulatory framework. In Bulgaria, access is primarily through inclusion in the positive drug list following health technology assessment or via individual access schemes under Ordinance No. 2/2019, which allows for ad hoc reimbursement. This study evaluates the timeliness and extent of Bulgarian patient access to orphan-designated drugs authorized by the European Medicines Agency. Methods: We analyzed European Medicines Agency-authorized orphan drugs between July 2006 and September 2023 using data from the European Medicines Agency, Bulgarian health technology assessment bodies, positive drug list records, and individual access scheme reports. Medians, interquartile ranges, stratified analyses, and permutation/bootstrapping methods were applied. Results: Of the 142 European Medicines Agency-approved orphan drugs, only 41 (28.9%) were included in the Bulgarian positive drug list. The median time to positive drug list inclusion was 828 days, with pre-health technology assessment delays (median 570 days) as the main bottleneck. Health technology assessment evaluations had a median duration of 204 days. Cancer and accelerated-assessment drugs reached health technology assessment faster, while conditional approvals faced longer delays. Twenty-four drugs were accessed through individual schemes; twenty remained outside the positive drug list. Overall, 43.0% of orphan drugs reached Bulgarian patients via either mechanism. Conclusions: Access to orphan drugs in Bulgaria is limited and delayed, mainly due to pre-health technology assessment lags. In light of the forthcoming European Union health technology assessment regulation, Bulgaria must ensure that national processes are capable of rapidly translating centralized assessments into meaningful patient access.},

  abstractnote = {Background/Objectives: Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability globally, with limited reliable early predictors of functional outcomes and survival. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of two novel predictors: the hypoperfusion intensity ratio calculated from mean transit time and time-to-drain maps (HIR-MTT–TTD), derived from computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging parameters, and the Inflammation–Coagulation Index (ICI), which integrates systemic inflammatory (C-reactive protein and white blood cell count) and hemostatic (D-dimer) markers. Methods: This prospective, single-center observational study included 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis and underwent pre-treatment CTP imaging. HIR-MTT–TTD evaluated collateral status and perfusion deficit severity, while ICI integrated C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and D-dimer levels. Functional outcomes were assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 24 h, 3 months, and 1 year. Results: Of 60 patients, 53.3% achieved functional independence (mRS 0–2) at 1 year. Unadjusted Cox models showed HIR-MTT–TTD (HR = 6.25, 95% CI: 1.48–26.30, p = 0.013) and ICI (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00–1.17, p = 0.052) were associated with higher 12-month mortality, worse mRS, and lower Barthel scores. After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, and sex, these associations became non-significant (HIR-MTT–TTD: HR = 2.83, 95% CI: 0.37–21.37, p = 0.314; ICI: HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.96–1.19, p = 0.211). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated moderate predictive value, with ICI (AUC = 0.756, 95% CI: 0.600–0.867) outperforming HIR-MTT–TTD (AUC = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48–0.83) for mortality prediction. Conclusions: The study introduces promising prognostic tools for functional outcomes. Elevated HIR-MTT–TTD and ICI values were independently associated with greater initial stroke severity, poorer functional recovery, and increased 1-year mortality. These findings underscore the prognostic significance of hypoperfusion intensity and systemic thrombo-inflammation in acute ischemic stroke. Combining the use of the presented indices may enhance early risk stratification and guide individualized treatment strategies.},
