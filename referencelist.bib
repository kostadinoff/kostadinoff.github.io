  abstractnote = {Since 72% of rare diseases are genetic in origin and mostly paediatrics, genetic newborn screening represents a diagnostic “window of opportunity”. Therefore, many gNBS initiatives started in different European countries. Screen4Care is a research project, which resulted of a joint effort between the European Union Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. It focuses on genetic newborn screening and artificial intelligence-based tools which will be applied to a large European population of about 25.000 infants. The neonatal screening strategy will be based on targeted sequencing, while whole genome sequencing will be offered to all enrolled infants who may show early symptoms but have resulted negative at the targeted sequencing-based newborn screening. We will leverage artificial intelligence-based algorithms to identify patients using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and to build a repository “symptom checkers” for patients and healthcare providers. S4C will design an equitable, ethical, and sustainable framework for genetic newborn screening and new digital tools, corroborated by a large workout where legal, ethical, and social complexities will be addressed with the intent of making the framework highly and flexibly translatable into the diverse European health systems.},

First identified and described in 1924, today the pathophysiological aspects that distinguish it from other thrombotic vasculopathies and serve as targets for innovative therapies are known. TTP is divided into inherited and acquired forms. The acquired form can be idiopathic or secondary. The current classification of the World Health Organization defines TTP in the category of thrombotic microangiopathies. Studying the epidemiology of aTTP is challenging due to several objective factors. The disease is characterized by a specific laboratory immunologic panel, which is often technically unavailable for many clinical centers. The presence of severe clinical presentations, often accompanied by comorbidities and rapid fatal progression, is also a barrier to establishing the true prevalence of the disease. This publication aims to analyze epidemiological data for aTTP and provide an assessment of the prevalence of this condition in Bulgaria.},

However, the inclusion of all types of cancer in a single category in health policy development has been criticized. Due to their clinical and epidemiological characteristics, patients with rare tumors face greater barriers in accessing innovative medications, combined with a lack of expertise in the diagnostic and therapeutic process. The development of separate policies for these patients requires a precise definition of the concept.
                  This review aims to present the chronological development of defining the concept of rare tumors in the context of building health policies in this area. For the purposes of the review, a search was conducted using keywords "rare cancers," "rare tumors," and "rare neoplasm" in the PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases, as well as Google Scholar. The articles found are organized into three main contexts of using the term "rare tumors" – clinically based definitions; definitions based on epidemiological criteria; and definitions used in pediatric oncology.},

Despite their promising potential, challenges such as uncertainty regarding long-term health benefits and safety, along with extreme price tags, pose significant obstacles to patient access. Within the EU, the European Medicines Agency plays a pivotal role with regards to GT market authorization. However, national authorities are responsible for pricing and reimbursement, which results in fragment patient access within the EU. This study aimed to provide an overview of the complex landscape of post-market authorization accessibility for GT products in Bulgaria, comparing it with neighboring EU countries. We applied a mixed-methods approach, including desk research, public data requests, and list price comparisons. As of 1 April 2023, 14 GTs had a valid market authorization at the EU level. In Bulgaria, Kymriah® was the only GT included in the Positive Drug List (PDL), with an official list price of EUR 335,636.94. Similar results were found in Romania, whereas five GTs were included in Greece’s PDL. Additionally, Zolgensma® was found accessible in Bulgaria through an alternative individual access scheme at an estimated price of EUR 1,945,000.00. In conclusion, this study emphasized targeted policy interventions to address health inequalities and to ensure timely access to GTs within the EU.},
