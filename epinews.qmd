Welcome to Epidemiology Weekly — a regularly updated section featuring key news, insights, and trends from the world of epidemiology, public health, and health policy. Each week, I share highlights and analyses from global, European, and Bulgarian sources — bringing together the most relevant developments shaping population health.

You can filter the posts by category, date, or topic to easily find what interests you most.
It’s my commitment to keep this section updated every week — a small promise to make epidemiology more accessible, timely, and connected to real-world change.
