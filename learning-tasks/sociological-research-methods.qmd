# Practical Class Instructions:

This document contains a series of interactive scenarios designed for group work in social medicine and public health workshops. The instructor will choose a scenario for each group (or pair of groups) to solve using the principles of sociological research methods.

### Reference Material

*This assignment is based on the reading material: [Sociological Research Methods in Medicine](../15-minute-learning/sociological-research-methods.qmd). All methodological justifications and critiques must reference concepts from this text.*

### General Instructions for Students

Each group will independently solve a distinct research problem. Your task is to:

1. **Analyze the Research Question**: Determine which sociological method (survey, observation, interview or documentary analysis) best addresses it.
2. **Design the Instrument**: Create a concrete data collection tool with 10-15 specific items - questionnaire, observation protocol, interview guide, or document analysis framework.
3. **Justify Your Approach**: Explain why your method is appropriate, addressing research purpose, validity threats, and practical constraints.
4. **The Battle (Debate)**: Prepare to defend your choice and critique alternative methods using evidence-based reasoning.

## Scenario: "The Healthcare Worker Burnout Crisis"

### Context and Background:

University Hospital Plovdiv has experienced a 40% increase in physician resignations. Emergency and ICU physicians account for 67% of these. Exit interviews mention "moral injury," "administrative burden," and "lack of institutional support," but these brief 12-minute conversations lack the depth needed for intervention planning. The hospital director needs to know: **What specific factors drive departure? Which interventions would work? Do drivers vary by department?**

### Your Research Task:

**Primary Question:** What are the multilayered factors (workload, compensation, culture, moral distress) driving resignations, and which are most amenable to intervention?

### Option A: Structured Survey Approach

**Method:** Standardized questionnaire distributed to all current and recently departed physicians.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Burnout Scales:** How will you measure the *severity* of burnout?
- **Stressor Categories:** Group items into workload, administrative tasks, and social support.
- **Anonymity:** How will you ensure doctors feel safe enough to criticize their superiors?
- **Logic:** Think about statistical power and the ability to compare different departments.

### Option B: In-Depth Interview Approach

**Method:** Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 30 current and former physicians.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Rapport:** How do you start the conversation to make a stressed doctor open up?
- **The "Why":** Use probes to move past phrases like "I was tired" to actual causal events.
- **Moral Injury:** Design questions that explore the gap between clinical ideals and hospital reality.
- **Logic:** Think about "thick description" and capturing the temporal sequence of the decision to quit.

### Option C: Documentary Analysis

**Method:** Systematic audit of administrative records, shift rosters, and resignation letters.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Objective Data:** How do HR records on overtime and sick leave correlate with resignation dates?
- **The "Official" Reason:** Compare resignation letters with exit interview notes—where are the gaps?
- **Incident Reports:** Track if departments with the most "near-misses" also have the highest turnover.
- **Logic:** Explain how document analysis provides a baseline of "hard facts" to compare with subjective reports.

### Option D: Ethnographic Observation

**Method:** Researcher immersion in the ICU and ER environments over a 4-week period.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Micro-stressors:** Capture things doctors don't report (e.g., noise levels, broken equipment, interruptions).
- **Communication Flow:** Observe how hierarchy affects interactions between departments.
- **"Invisible Work":** Note time spent on administrative "scut work" versus patient care.
- **Logic:** Address the value of seeing stressors in real-time rather than relying on memory.

## Scenario: "Hospital Hand Hygiene Compliance"

### Context and Background:

Surgical site infections (SSIs) have increased by 35%, potentially costing the hospital 180,000 EUR in penalties. Administration claims 80% compliance based on alcohol gel consumption, but the Infection Control nurse disputes this, noting that consumption doesn't reveal *who* is washing their hands or *if* they are doing it at the right clinical moments.

### Your Research Task:

**Primary Question:** What is the actual hand hygiene compliance rate among different healthcare worker categories (surgeons, nurses, students) across different clinical settings (ICU, Wards)?

### Option A: Structured Survey Approach

**Method:** Anonymous questionnaire on self-reported compliance and perceived barriers.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Social Desirability Bias:** How do you ask "do you wash your hands" without everyone just saying "yes"?
- **Barrier Identification:** Design items to rank reasons for non-compliance (lack of time, skin irritation, sink distance).
- **Knowledge vs. Action:** Test their knowledge of the "5 Moments" vs. their reported behavior.
- **Logic:** Explain how surveys can reach the entire hospital staff quickly to identify cultural norms.

### Option B: Focus Group Approach

**Method:** Facilitated discussions with groups of surgeons, nurses, and residents.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Hierarchy:** Should you mix surgeons and students in the same group? Why or why not?
- **Peer Pressure:** How do you explore "unspoken rules" (e.g., "we only wash when the Chief is watching")?
- **System Fixes:** Ask staff to design their "ideal" hygiene station to identify structural flaws.
- **Logic:** Focus on how group dynamics reveal collective attitudes that individual observations might miss.

### Option C: Documentary Analysis

**Method:** Audit of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) procurement vs. clinical activity logs.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Proxy Measures:** Can you calculate "liters per patient-day" across different wards?
- **Temporal Trends:** Does compliance (gel use) drop during night shifts or high-admission periods?
- **Correlation:** Link infection rate spikes in specific wards to their ABHR consumption records.
- **Logic:** Address the "Gel consumption vs. true compliance" debate—is more gel always better?

### Option D: Hybrid Observation (Overt/Covert)

**Method:** Trained observers using standardized checklists in clinical areas.

**Hints for your design:**

- **WHO 5 Moments:** How will you code "before touching a patient" vs. "after"?
- **The Hawthorne Effect:** How do you handle the fact that people act differently when they see you with a clipboard?
- **Ethics:** If using covert observation, how do you justify it? Think about "Deferred Consent."
- **Logic:** Explain why seeing "real behavior" is the gold standard for clinical compliance research.

## Scenario: "Improving Maternal Health Clinic Attendance"

### Context and Background

Roma women in suburban Plovdiv attend prenatal care at much lower rates (43%) than the general population (87%). Administrators blame "culture," while community workers suspect "discrimination" and "structural barriers." Late presentation leads to higher rates of preventable complications and maternal mortality.

### Your Research Task

**Primary Question:** What are the real barriers (economic, social, health system-related) preventing attendance, and how do they interact?

### Option A: Structured Survey Approach

**Method:** Community-wide survey targeting Roma households in selected districts.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Language and Literacy:** How will you administer the survey if participants have varying literacy levels?
- **Perception Items:** Design Likert scales to measure trust in the healthcare system and perceived discrimination.
- **Accessibility:** Include items on distance, cost of transport, and "opportunity cost" (lost work time).
- **Logic:** Explain how representative sampling can prove that barriers are structural, not just "cultural."

### Option B: Focus Group Method

**Method:** Facilitated discussions with Roma women and community health mediators.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Homogeneity:** Should the group be all women? Should the moderator be from the community?
- **Sensitive Topics:** How do you ask about discrimination without "putting words in their mouths"?
- **Social Norms:** Design prompts that explore what the *community* thinks about clinics, not just the individual.
- **Logistics:** Think about childcare, transportation, and incentives to attend the session.

### Option C: Documentary Analysis

**Method:** Systematic audit of medical records, appointment logs, and staff communications.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Patterns:** What variables in a medical record show "differential treatment" (e.g., fewer labs, late initiation)?
- **Structural Barriers:** Can you prove wait times are longer for certain districts through the database?
- **Sanitization:** Address the fact that doctors don't write "I was rude" in the medical notes.
- **Objectivity:** Explain how an audit trail provides "hard evidence" that interviews might miss.

### Option D: Environmental Observation

**Method:** "Mystery Shopper" or waiting room observation at the maternal clinics.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Atmosphere:** How does the clinic staff treat patients who arrive late or without documents?
- **Visual Cues:** Are there signs in Romani? Is the waiting room welcoming or intimidating?
- **The "Welcome":** Observe the first 120 seconds of the interaction—what is the non-verbal communication?
- **Logic:** Justify how observing the *setting* explains why women might choose not to return.

## Scenario: "Tuberculosis Treatment Adherence"

### Context and Background

28% of TB patients in Plovdiv stop their 6-month treatment early, leading to multi-drug resistant TB. Many stop around Week 11. Brief exit interviews suggest "work conflicts" or "feeling better," but the dispensary needs a deeper understanding of why patients take the risk of stopping.

### Your Research Task

**Primary Question:** What are the multilayered barriers preventing completion, and why do they become critical at specific time points (like Week 11)?

### Option A: Structured Survey Approach

**Method:** Standardized adherence screening tool (e.g., MMAS-8) applied to all current patients.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Timing:** At what Week (1, 4, 8, 11) do you administer the survey to catch "early warnings"?
- **Psychosocial Items:** Include scales for depression, social support, and TB-related stigma.
- **Self-Report Accuracy:** How do you design questions to reduce "faking good" (social desirability)?
- **Logic:** Focus on identifying statistical "at-risk" profiles across a large population.

### Option B: Individual In-Depth Interviews

**Method:** Narrative interviews with both "Completers" and "Discontinuers."

**Hints for your design:**

- **Temporal Sequence:** Map the journey from diagnosis to the moment they decided to stop.
- **Stigma:** How do you explore if the fear of neighbors finding out affects clinic visits?
- **Side Effects:** Move past "I felt sick" to how side effects interfered with their specific life (work, parenting).
- **Comparison:** What did the "Completers" have that the others didn't (Support? Better education?)?

### Option C: Documentary Analysis

**Method:** Analysis of treatment cards, side effect reports, and social work assessments.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Predictors:** Can you find a "red flag" in the early notes that predicts who will quit later?
- **Documentation Gaps:** If a patient quit, did the staff *actually* record any follow-up attempts?
- **Side Effect Mapping:** Track the correlation between documented nausea/hepatitis and the date of discontinuation.
- **Power:** Explain how analyzing the *entire* 2024 cohort (150 patients) is stronger than small samples.

### Option D: Direct Observation (DOT) Session Analysis

**Method:** Observation of "Directly Observed Therapy" interactions at the dispensary.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Interaction Quality:** Does the nurse just "watch them swallow" or do they ask about side effects?
- **Patient Burden:** Observe the time it takes for a patient to travel, wait, and get their dose.
- **Verbal vs. Non-verbal:** Do patients look hesitant or rushed during the interaction?
- **Logic:** Justify how observing the *delivery* of the drug helps explain the decision to quit.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Methodological Precision (30%):** Instrument design follows the logic of the chosen method.
- **Conceptual Application (30%):** Arguments explicitly reference the 15-minute reading material.
- **Critical Reasoning (20%):** Groups identify and address valid threats (Recall Bias, Hawthorne Effect, Ecological Fallacy).
- **Communication (20%):** Ability to defend and critique professionally.
