# Practical Class Instructions:

This document contains a series of interactive scenarios designed for group work in social medicine and public health workshops. The instructor will choose a scenario for each group (or pair of groups) to solve using the principles of sociological research methods.

### Reference Material

*This assignment is based on the reading material: [Sociological Research Methods in Medicine](../15-minute-learning/sociological-research-methods.qmd). All methodological justifications and critiques must reference concepts from this text.*

### General Instructions for Students

Each group will independently solve a distinct research problem. Your task is to:

1. **Analyze the Research Question**: Determine which sociological method (survey, observation, interview or documentary analysis) best addresses it.
2. **Design the Instrument**: Create a concrete data collection tool with 10-15 specific items - questionnaire, observation protocol, interview guide, or document analysis framework.
3. **Justify Your Approach**: Explain why your method is appropriate, addressing research purpose, validity threats, and practical constraints.
4. **The Battle (Debate)**: Prepare to defend your choice and critique alternative methods using evidence-based reasoning.

## Scenario: "The Healthcare Worker Burnout Crisis"

### Context and Background:

University Hospital Plovdiv has experienced a 40% increase in physician resignations. Emergency and ICU physicians account for 67% of these. Exit interviews mention "moral injury," "administrative burden," and "lack of institutional support," but these brief 12-minute conversations lack the depth needed for intervention planning. The hospital director needs to know: **What specific factors drive departure? Which interventions would work? Do drivers vary by department?**

### Your Research Task:

**Primary Question:** What are the multilayered factors (workload, compensation, culture, moral distress) driving resignations, and which are most amenable to intervention?

### Option A: Structured Survey Approach

**Method:** Standardized questionnaire distributed to all current and recently departed physicians.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Burnout Scales:** How will you measure the *severity* of burnout?
- **Stressor Categories:** Group items into workload, administrative tasks, and social support.
- **Anonymity:** How will you ensure doctors feel safe enough to criticize their superiors?
- **Logic:** Think about statistical power and the ability to compare different departments.

### Option B: In-Depth Interview Approach

**Method:** Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 30 current and former physicians.

**Hints for your design:**
- **Rapport:** How do you start the conversation to make a stressed doctor open up?
- **The "Why":** Use probes to move past phrases like "I was tired" to actual causal events.
- **Moral Injury:** Design questions that explore the gap between clinical ideals and hospital reality.
- **Logic:** Think about "thick description" and capturing the temporal sequence of the decision to quit.

## Scenario: "Hospital Hand Hygiene Compliance"

### Context and Background:

Surgical site infections (SSIs) have increased by 35%, potentially costing the hospital 180,000 EUR in penalties. Administration claims 80% compliance based on alcohol gel consumption, but the Infection Control nurse disputes this, noting that consumption doesn't reveal *who* is washing their hands or *if* they are doing it at the right clinical moments.

### Your Research Task:

**Primary Question:** What is the actual hand hygiene compliance rate among different healthcare worker categories (surgeons, nurses, students) across different clinical settings (ICU, Wards)?

### Option A: Overt Observation

**Method:** Visible observers in clinical areas using standardized checklists.

**Hints for your design:**

- **WHO 5 Moments:** How will you code "before touching a patient" vs. "after"?
- **The Hawthorne Effect:** How do you handle the fact that people act differently when they see you with a clipboard?
- **Inter-rater Reliability:** How do you ensure two different observers count the same way?
- **Checklist:** Design a grid that captures the *who*, the *when*, and the *how well*.

### Option B: Covert/Hybrid Observation

**Method:** Disguised observers or hidden cameras to capture baseline behavior.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Ethics:** How do you justify observing staff without their immediate knowledge? Think about "Deferred Consent."
- **Camera Placement:** Where would you put a camera to see the sink but respect privacy?
- **Technical Detail:** Can a camera see if they used enough soap and rubbed for 20 seconds?
- **The "Ground Truth":** Explain why seeing "real behavior" outweighs the ethical complexity.

## Scenario: "Improving Maternal Health Clinic Attendance"

### Context and Background

Roma women in suburban Plovdiv attend prenatal care at much lower rates (43%) than the general population (87%). Administrators blame "culture," while community workers suspect "discrimination" and "structural barriers." Late presentation leads to higher rates of preventable complications and maternal mortality.

### Your Research Task

**Primary Question:** What are the real barriers (economic, social, health system-related) preventing attendance, and how do they interact?

### Option A: Focus Group Method

**Method:** Facilitated discussions with Roma women who attended few or no visits.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Homogeneity:** Should the group be all women? Should the moderator be from the community?
- **Sensitive Topics:** How do you ask about discrimination without "putting words in their mouths"?
- **Social Norms:** Design prompts that explore what the *community* thinks about clinics, not just the individual.
- **Logistics:** Think about childcare, transportation, and incentives to attend the session.

### Option B: Documentary Analysis

**Method:** Systematic audit of medical records, appointment logs, and staff communications.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Patterns:** What variables in a medical record show "differential treatment" (e.g., fewer labs, late initiation)?
- **Structural Barriers:** Can you prove wait times are longer for certain districts through the database?
- **Sanitization:** Address the fact that doctors don't write "I was rude" in the medical notes.
- **Objectivity:** Explain how an audit trail provides "hard evidence" that interviews might miss.

## Scenario: "Tuberculosis Treatment Adherence"

### Context and Background

28% of TB patients in Plovdiv stop their 6-month treatment early, leading to multi-drug resistant TB. Many stop around Week 11. Brief exit interviews suggest "work conflicts" or "feeling better," but the dispensary needs a deeper understanding of why patients take the risk of stopping.

### Your Research Task

**Primary Question:** What are the multilayered barriers preventing completion, and why do they become critical at specific time points (like Week 11)?

### Option A: Individual In-Depth Interviews:

**Method:** Narrative interviews with both "Completers" and "Discontinuers."

**Hints for your design:**

- **Temporal Sequence:** Map the journey from diagnosis to the moment they decided to stop.
- **Stigma:** How do you explore if the fear of neighbors finding out affects clinic visits?
- **Side Effects:** Move past "I felt sick" to how side effects interfered with their specific life (work, parenting).
- **Comparison:** What did the "Completers" have that the others didn't (Support? Better education?)?

### Option B: Documentary Analysis
**Method:** Analysis of treatment cards, side effect reports, and social work assessments.

**Hints for your design:**

- **Predictors:** Can you find a "red flag" in the early notes that predicts who will quit later?
- **Documentation Gaps:** If a patient quit, did the staff *actually* record any follow-up attempts or social assessments?
- **Side Effect Mapping:** Track the correlation between documented nausea/hepatitis and the date of discontinuation.
- **Power:** Explain how analyzing the *entire* 2024 cohort (150 patients) is stronger than small interview samples.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Methodological Precision (30%):** Instrument design follows the logic of the chosen method.
- **Conceptual Application (30%):** Arguments explicitly reference the 15-minute reading material.
- **Critical Reasoning (20%):** Groups identify and address valid threats (Recall Bias, Hawthorne Effect, Ecological Fallacy).
- **Communication (20%):** Ability to defend and critique professionally.
