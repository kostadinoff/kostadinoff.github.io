# Practical Class Instructions:

This document contains a series of interactive scenarios designed for group work in social medicine and public health workshops. The instructor will choose a scenario for each group (or pair of groups) to solve using the principles of sociological research methods.

### Reference Material

*This assignment is based on the reading material: [Sociological Research Methods in Medicine](../15-minute-learning/sociological-research-methods.qmd). All methodological justifications and critiques must reference concepts from this text.*

### General Instructions for Students

Each group will independently solve a distinct research problem. Your task is to:

1. **Analyze the Research Question**: Determine which sociological method (survey, observation, interview or documentary analysis) best addresses it.
2. **Design the Instrument**: Create a concrete data collection tool - questionnaire, interview guide, observation checklist or documentary analysis framework.
3. **The Battle (Debate)**: Prepare to defend your choice and critique alternative methods using evidence-based reasoning.

## Scenario "The Healthcare Worker Burnout Crisis"

**The Problem:**: University Hospital Plovdiv has experienced a 40% increase in physician resignations. Exit interviews mention "*moral injury*", "*administrative burden*", and "*lack of institutional support*".

**Goal:** Understand the drivers of burnout to plan interventions.

You choose to use:

### Structured Survey Approach:

- **Your Stance:** Use a standardized questionnaire (burnout assessment, stressor categories, demographics) distributed to all physicians.
- **Strengths:** Systematic comparison across departments; anonymity encourages disclosure of workplace criticism; large sample size for statistical power.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** How do you capture complex "moral injury" in a closed-ended scale? What about social desirability bias (fear of appearing weak)?

OR 

### In-Depth Interview Approach

- **Your Stance:** Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of current and former physicians.
- **Strengths:** Reveals lived experiences and causal mechanisms (the "why"); follow-up questions probe beneath surface explanations.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Is a sample of 20-30 representative of 400+ doctors? How do you handle interviewer bias and the time-intensive nature of qualitative work?

## Scenario "Hospital Hand Hygiene Compliance"

**The Problem:** Surgical site infections have increased by 35%. Administration claims 80% hygiene compliance, but clinical evidence suggests otherwise.

**Goal:** Document true compliance rates and situational triggers for non-compliance.

You choose to use:

### Overt Observation (Visible Observers)

- **Your Stance:** Trained observers use a checklist based on WHO's "5 Moments for Hand Hygiene" while visible to staff.
- **Strengths:** High reliability; observers can clarify clinical context; easier ethical approval.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** The Hawthorne Effect—staff will perform perfectly only while you are watching.

OR

### Covert/Hybrid Observation

- **Your Stance:** Use disguised observers or hidden cameras to capture baseline behavior, followed by overt observation for feedback.
- **Strengths:** Captures "true" behavior without reactivity; reveals hidden patterns of non-compliance.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Serious ethical concerns regarding informed consent and workplace surveillance.

## Scenario: Improving Maternal Health Clinic Attendance

**The Problem:** Roma communities in suburban Plovdiv attend prenatal care at lower rates. Administrators suspect "culture," while community workers suspect "discrimination."

**Goal:** Redesign the service based on actual barriers.

You choose to use:

### Focus Group Method

- **Your Stance:** Facilitate discussions with women who stopped attending to reveal collective sense-making and shared experiences.
- **Strengths:** Reveals social norms and community-held beliefs; safer space for sensitive topics like discrimination.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Dominant voices may silence others; results might represent "consensus" rather than individual reality.

OR

### Documentary Analysis

- **Your Stance:** Audit medical records, appointment logs, and staff communications for patterns of differential treatment.
- **Strengths:** Objective audit trail; immune to recall bias; identifies structural barriers in scheduling or documentation.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Records show what was documented, not the "informal" tone of voice or dismissive body language.

## Scenario: Tuberculosis Treatment Adherence (Mixed Methods)

**The Problem:** 28% of TB patients in Plovdiv stop treatment early. Brief exit interviews lack depth.

**Goal:** Redesign the "Directly Observed Therapy" (DOT) program.

You choose to use:

### Individual Interviews

- **Your Stance:** Conduct semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of current and former TB patients.
- **Strengths:** Reveals lived experiences and causal mechanisms (the "why"); follow-up questions probe beneath surface explanations.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Is a sample of 20-30 representative of 400+ doctors? How do you handle interviewer bias and the time-intensive nature of qualitative work?

OR

### Documentary Analysis

- **Your Stance:** Audit medical records, appointment logs, and staff communications for patterns of differential treatment.
- **Strengths:** Objective audit trail; immune to recall bias; identifies structural barriers in scheduling or documentation.
- **Anticipate Critiques:** Records show what was documented, not the "informal" tone of voice or dismissive body language.
