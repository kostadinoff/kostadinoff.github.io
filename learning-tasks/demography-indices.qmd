# Practical Class Instructions:

This document contains a series of interactive scenarios designed for group work in social medicine and public health workshops. Each group will work through a specific case study to calculate demographic indices, interpret population trends, and navigate the legal requirements for civil status registration.

### Reference Material

*This assignment is based on the reading material: [Demography Indices and the Physician's Role in Registration](../15-minute-learning/demography-indices.qmd). All calculations and legal justifications must reference concepts and ordinances from this text.*

### General Instructions for Students

Each group will independently solve a distinct demographic problem. Your task is to:

1.  **Perform the Calculations**: Solve the requested indices in sequence using the provided formulas. Show all working.
2.  **Interpret the Results**: Relate the numbers to the demographic stages and assessment categories (low/high/average).
3.  **Address the Discussion Questions**: Formulate brief, evidence-based answers (3–5 sentences) for class presentation.

## Case Study 1: "The Invisible Influx"

### Migration as the Hidden Driver of Population Growth

**Scenario:** The nation of *Arcadia* has a low birth rate and ageing population, yet cities are overcrowding. Clinics are overwhelmed by undocumented residents. The Ministry of Health needs to understand the true source of this growth.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Population at start of year ($P_{x-1}$) | 10,000,000 |
| Population at end of year ($P_x$) | 10,060,000 |
| Live births during the year ($B$) | 100,000 |
| Deaths during the year ($D$) | 90,000 |

**Your Task:**

1.  Calculate **Natural Increase** absolute ($B - D$).
2.  Use the **Demographic Balance Equation** to find **Net Migration** ($M$): $P_x = P_{x-1} + B - D + M$.
3.  Calculate **Crude Birth Rate (CBR)** and **Crude Death Rate (CDR)** per 1,000 population. State their assessment categories.
4.  Calculate **Net Migration Rate** per 1,000 population.

**Discussion Hints:**

- Compare natural increase vs. net migration: Which is the "engine" of growth?
- How does a "young adult" labor migration shift the population pyramid?
- What are the risks of a "hidden" population for infectious disease surveillance (e.g., vaccine coverage)?

## Case Study 2: "The Silver Tsunami"

### Quantifying the Burden of Population Ageing

**Scenario:** *Nipponica* has exceptional life expectancy, but the workforce is shrinking. Planners need a full demographic profile to justify evidence-based reforms to the national health insurance.

| Age group | Population |
|-----------|------------|
| Under 15 years | 15,000,000 |
| 15 to 64 years (working age) | 70,000,000 |
| 65 years and older | 35,000,000 |
| **Total** | **120,000,000** |

*Special Data:* $80+$ years $= 8.4M$; Women $50-64 = 9.6M$.

**Your Task:**

1.  Calculate **Child Dependency Ratio (CDR)** and **Old-Age Dependency Ratio (OADR)**.
2.  Calculate **Total Dependency Ratio**. Interpret: how many dependents per 100 workers?
3.  Calculate the **Ageing Index**.
4.  Calculate the **Caretaker Ratio** ($P_{80+} / F_{50-64} \times 100$).

**Discussion Hints:**

- Which ratio best communicates "fiscal pressure" to a politician?
- How does the "infrastructure of care" change when a population moves from Stage 4 to Stage 5?
- Discuss "Compression of Morbidity": Do the numbers tell the whole story of disability?

## Case Study 3: "The Vulnerable Generation"

### High Fertility, Infant Mortality, and the Demographic Trap

**Scenario:** *Equatoria* is a developing region with rapid growth. Infant mortality is catastrophic, and maternal wards are overwhelmed. You must prioritize resources for the regional health authority.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total mid-year population | 5,000,000 |
| Live births | 200,000 |
| Deaths < 1 year | 16,000 |
| Deaths < 28 days | 9,600 |
| Stillbirths | 4,000 |
| Women aged 15–49 | 1,200,000 |

**Your Task:**

1.  Calculate **Crude Birth Rate (CBR)** and **General Fertility Rate (GFR)**.
2.  Calculate **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**. State its assessment level (Very Low to Very High).
3.  Calculate **Neonatal** and **Post-neonatal Mortality Rates**. What causes do these suggest?
4.  Calculate **Perinatal Mortality Rate**. (Assume early neonatal deaths are 60% of total neonatal deaths).

**Discussion Hints:**

- Explain the "Demographic Trap": Why does high infant mortality prevent family planning?
- Reframe contraception as a *clinical* intervention for infant survival (birth intervals).
- Identify the "low-hanging fruit": Is it cleaner water or better NICUs that this data calls for?

## Case Study 4: "The Reversed Transition"

### Below-Replacement Fertility and Excess Male Mortality

**Scenario:** *Borealis* is shrinking. Fertility is "lowest-low," and middle-aged men are dying at high rates from preventable causes (cirrhosis, lung cancer). Classical transition theory is being defied.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total mid-year population | 140,000,000 |
| Live births | 1,400,000 |
| Total deaths | 1,960,000 |
| Premature deaths (< 65 yrs) | 470,400 |
| Male / Female deaths | 1.078M / 0.882M |
| Total Fertility Rate (TFR) | 1.3 |

**Your Task:**

1.  Calculate **Crude Birth Rate** and **Crude Death Rate**.
2.  Calculate the **Rate of Natural Increase (RNI)**. Interpret a negative result.
3.  Calculate **Proportion of Premature Deaths**. (Assume 70% of premature deaths are male).
4.  Calculate the **Male-to-Female Death Ratio**.

**Discussion Hints:**

- Contrast the "Proximate Causes" of death in Borealis vs. Equatoria.
- What is the "economic suicide" of lowest-low fertility combined with male premature mortality?
- Evaluate pronatalist policy vs. public health lifestyle interventions: Which yields results faster?
