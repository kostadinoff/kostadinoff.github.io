All respondents must be gathered in one place at the same time.\nNot suitable for studying individuals not organized in groups.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Individual Survey\n\nDefinition: A form of inquiry where the respondent fills out the provided survey form by themselves, individually, rather than in a group setting. The interviewer is not required to be present during the completion.\nAdvantages:\n\nThe questionnaire reaches each individual designated for surveying.\nThe individual responds to the questions at their own convenience.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires more time to conduct the study.\nRaises doubts among respondents about anonymity.\nNot convenient for assessing knowledge.\nDifficult to control the behavior of the surveyed individuals.\n\n\n\n\nMail Survey / Online Survey\n\nDefinition: A form of surveying where the questionnaire reaches the surveyed individuals by mail (in an envelope, newspaper, or magazine) and is returned to the survey organizer by mail. With the online communication, its variation is used - the online survey: where a link is sent (published on social networks or via email), and the respondent answers at their convenience and through an electronic device.\nAdvantages:\n\nNo need for interviewers.\nThe respondent answers the questions in a familiar environment and at their convenience.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThere is low response rate. That can reduce the representativeness of the sample.\nNot suitable for surveys assessing knowledge, due to the possibility of external consultation.\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Survey = Structured Interview\n\nDefinition: A form of inquiry where the interviewer fills out the questionnaire themselves after gathering the necessary information from the individual by asking questions.\nAdvantages:\n\nProvides an opportunity to obtain information from all intended participants in the study.\nThe reliability of the information is higher as it is obtained from different sources.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires a large number of interviewers.\nInterviewers must have high general culture, work conscientiously, and responsibly.\nRequires prolonged time and financial resources."

It is carried out using specific methodology. Participant observation always takes place in community settings, in locations believed to have some relevance to the research questions. The method is distinctive because the researcher approaches participants in their own environment rather than having the participants come to the researcher. Generally speaking, the researcher engaged in participant observation tries to learn what life is like for an “insider” while remaining, inevitably, an “outsider”. In the community setting, the researcher makes careful, objective notes about what he sees, recording all accounts and observations as field notes in a field notebook. Informal conversation and interaction with members of the study population are also important components of the method and should be recorded in the field notes, in as much detail as possible."

This sociological method finds wide application in practice. However, it should be distinguished from its use in journalism, for conversation between an employer and a job candidate, between a lawyer and a client, as well as between a doctor and a patient.

    "text": "Types\n\nAccording to the type of questionnaire used:\n\nStructured standard with a questionnaire form - The most formal format is a questionnaire. The exact wording of each question is selected beforehand and each participant is asked the same questions in the same order.\nUnstructured - Deep interviews. Need have no agenda and no prearranged questions. The conversation can be allowed to take whatever path the participants find most interesting. In the context of research, however, the researcher is likely to have some preliminary ideas which will guide at least the initial questions. Nonetheless, he or she is not going to constrain the conversation. The qualitative in - depth interview is a favored strategy of data collection in qualitative research and produces rich data. It is a ‘conversation with a purpose’ in which the interviewer aims to obtain the perspectives, feelings and perceptions from the participants in the research. The in - depth interview is a technique designed to elicit a vivid picture of the participant’s perspective on the research topic. During in - depth interviews, the person being interviewed is considered the expert and the interviewer is considered the student. The researcher’s interviewing techniques are motivated by the desire to learn everything the participant can share about the research topic. Researchers engage with participants by posing questions in a neutral manner, listening attentively to participant’s responses, and asking follow - up questions and probes based on those responses. They do not lead participants according to any preconceived notions, nor do they encourage participants to provide particular answers by expressing approval or disapproval of what they say. In - depth interviews are usually conducted face - to - face and involve one interviewer and one participant. The details of conducting interviews have already been covered in detail in an earlier chapter and the readers are advised to go through the same.\nSemi-structured - Less formal. Here the questioner has an agenda: a specific topic to ask about and a set of questions which he or she wants answered. However, the exact wording of the questions is not considered critical and the order in which the questions are asked is not fixed. This allows the interview to flow more like a conversation. Nonetheless, the interviewer may have to steer the conversation back to the given topic and check that the original questions have been answered.\n\nAccording to the number of subjects studied:\n\nIndividual.\nCollective – focus groups discussion is a qualitative data collection method effective in helping researchers learn the social norms of a community or subgroup, as well as the range of perspectives that exist within that community or subgroup. Focus groups seek to illuminate group opinion. This method is especially well suited for socio-behavioural research that will be used to develop and measure health services that meet the needs of a given population. An FGD requires the following :\n\nThe focus is on a specific problem area, and the conversation is held not with one, but with several interviewees.\nThese participants should be as homogenous as possible with respect to their background characteristics.\nThere is a moderator conducting the discussion but not leading the discussion.\nThe topic, place, and time of the meeting are planned, and a script is prepared in advance. It includes introductory words on the topic, introduction of participants, the purpose of the discussion, and its subject.\nThe list of questions should contain several main questions, as well as supporting materials for illustration.\nThe discussions are led by a facilitator (moderator), who introduces topics and guides the discussion. The moderator should not evaluate the opinions of the interviewees. A co-moderator supervises the work in the focus group, assists, and intervenes if necessary, taking notes during the discussions.\nThe duration of the discussions is usually between one and a half to two hours. Typically, audio and video recordings are made of focus group discussions, and participants are informed in advance so they can decline participation.\nA group discussion is conducted with 8-12 people, discussing several main topics related to the research, monitoring, or evaluation being conducted.\nParticipants should not be in hierarchical or competitive relationships with each other, as this can block discussion. It is best if they do not know each other at all. Research tasks are transformed into a series of questions to be answered and discussed during the group work. This method establishes the typical attitudes and orientations of participants regarding the discussed issue.\n\n\nAccording to the frequency of conducting:\n\nSingle (one-time).\nMultiple.\n\nAccording to the method of conducting:\n\n“Face to face” - interviews involve the interviewer and participant being present together or, in the case of video link, able to see and hear each other in real time. The interviewer asks the questions and notes down the responses. Such interviews can occur in a number of places. They can be conducted:\n\non the interviewer’s territory, when participants visit the researcher’s place of work;\non the participant’s territory, when the interviewer visits the participant’s home or place of work; or\nwith each on his or her own territory via video link.\nFinally, they can be conducted on neutral territory such as outside a shop.\n\nRemote - Telephone; Online - Answers are immediately entered into a computer with specialized software for data processing and analysis."

    "text": "Brain death\nMedicine and society continue to struggle thoughtfully with the definition of death, particularly with the progression of sophisticated life-support systems that challenge traditional concepts. The questions of when a disease is irreversible, when further treatment is ineffective, or when death has occurred are of great consequence. These questions are independent of, and galvanized by, the practice of organ donation.\nBrain death is defined as the absence of all brain function demonstrated by profound coma with the irreversible loss of capacity for consciousness, loss of the ability to breathe and absence of all brain stem reflexes. Analogous to a cardiac arrest, it is better understood as brain arrest – the loss of all clinical brain function. If a proximate cause is known and there are no reversible conditions present, death is determined by documenting the absence of brain function by clinical examination. In most cases, brain death can be diagnosed at the bedside. Common causes include trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accidents, hypoxia owing to resuscitation after cardiac arrest, drug overdose or near drowning, primary brain tumor, meningitis, homicide, and suicide.\nThe concept of brain death was influenced by two major health care advances in the 1960s: the development of intensive care units, with artificial airways and mechanical ventilators to treat irreversible apnea, thus interrupting the natural evolution from brain failure to cardiac arrest, and the emergence of organ donation arising from the new discipline of transplant surgery. An ethical consensus existed that the donation itself must not cause the death of the donor, commonly referred to as the “dead donor” rule. Advanced technologies also revealed the existing limitations in the lexicon of death. The word death may be inadequate to describe the event or process in the various domains in which it can be defined, including medical–biological, legal, social, bioethical, philosophical, religious, spiritual, and existential. Brain death as a criterion for determining the death of a person is a medicolegal and social formulation. It implies a notion of irreversible loss of personhood and integrative functions of the brain. The diagnosis uncovers cultural and religious diversity in a pluralistic society.\nThe concept of brain death was influenced by two major health care advances in the 1960s: the development of intensive care units, with artificial airways and mechanical ventilators to treat irreversible apnea, thus interrupting the natural evolution from brain failure to cardiac arrest, and the emergence of organ donation arising from the new discipline of transplant surgery.

The following criteria apply\n\nEstablished etiology capable of causing brain death in the absence of reversible conditions capable of mimicking brain death\nDeep unresponsive coma\nAbsent brainstem reflexes as defined by absent gag and cough reflexes, corneal responses, pupillary responses to light with pupils at mid size or greater and vestibulo-ocular responses\nBilateral absence of motor responses, excluding spinal reflexes\nAbsent respiratory effort based on the apnea test\nAbsent confounding factors."

    "text": "Ethical considerations\nSince the first kidney transplant in 1954, the increasing success of, and innovations in, transplantation have created a demand for organs that greatly exceeds the supply in most countries. The scarcity of organs is a major impetus behind the continuing search for, and development of, alternative ways to expand the pool of organs and tissues available for transplantation. A major development is the procurement of organs from family members, and most recently from friends and even from strangers. We are also witnessing desperate patients soliciting organs on the Internet, the compensation of living donors for related expenses or even the bestowing of financial rewards for donation, and the experimental use of organs from animals (i.e., xenotransplantation). These recent trends are at the forefront of current ethical debate on transplantation, and they are gaining varying levels of acceptance in different countries by both the public and the transplant community. The sale of organs is another highly complex subject that has received much attention"

    "section": "According to the source of the organ",
    "text": "According to the source of the organ\nOrgan donation can be categorized based on the source of the organ, and there are various types of organ transplantation methods.\n\nHeterotransplantation, or xenotransplantation, is the practice of transplanting organs or tissues from one species to another.\n\nCross-Species Organ Transplants: Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs or tissues from animals (e.g., pigs) into humans to address the shortage of human organ donors.\nRisks of Disease Transmission: Critics argue that xenotransplantation may lead to the transmission of new viral diseases from animals to humans, posing ethical and public health concerns.\nLoss of Human Identity: Concerns exist about the psychological impact on recipients, as they may struggle with the idea of having animal organs. Pre- and post-operation counseling is seen as important to address these concerns.\nInformed Consent Challenges: Patients facing life-threatening situations may feel pressured to consent to xenotransplantation, raising questions about the validity of their consent.\nResource Allocation Dilemma: Xenotransplantation is expensive, and the allocation of resources in healthcare becomes an ethical issue, as it affects overall healthcare distribution.\nInstrumental Use of Animals: Using animals for organ transplantation should be justified based on aspects where humans are superior to animals. This raises questions about the ethics of using animals for the benefit of humans.\nAnimal Suffering: Donor animals may undergo increased suffering due to isolation and rigorous testing to prevent disease transmission. Genetic modifications are made to increase compatibility, further raising ethical concerns.\nBlurred Boundaries: Genetic alterations could make the boundary between humans and animals less distinct, challenging our understanding of species distinctions.\nDifferences Among Animals: Ethical perspectives differ on which animals are suitable donors. Some consider all animals equally acceptable, while others base acceptability on genetic similarity to humans.\n\nHomotransplantation / Allotransplantation:\n\nHomotransplantation, or allotransplantation, is the most common type of organ transplantation. It involves transplanting organs or tissues from one human to another of the same species.\nFor instance, a kidney transplant from a living or deceased human donor to a recipient is a common example of allotransplantation.\n\nIsotransplantation:\n\nIsotransplantation is a hypothetical term used to describe a situation where an organ or tissue is transplanted from one individual to another who is genetically identical.\nThis could occur, for example, in the case of an identical twin donating an organ to their sibling.\n\nAutotransplantation:\n\nAutotransplantation involves transplanting tissues or organs from one part of an individual’s body to another part of their own body.\nAn example of autotransplantation is a skin graft, where skin is taken from one area of a person’s body and transplanted to another area, often to treat burn injuries.\n\nBiotransplantation:\n\nBiotransplantation is a relatively uncommon term that can refer to any transplantation involving technologically modified tissues or organs or entirely artificial organs.\nFor example, a biotransplantation could involve transplanting a tissue or organ that has been modified using genetic engineering techniques or 3D bio-printing."

Attempts to resuscitate him are unsuccessful, and when he is weaned off the ventilator he does not make any respiratory effort. Tests performed by two different consultants confirm that he has had massive brainstem injuries, and he is declared brainstem dead despite the ventilator continuing to keep his heart and lungs working and consequently the rest of his organs perfused. Mike is registered on the national organ donation database and was carrying an organ donor card on him.

Това позволява да се правят полезни прогнози. Подобни “модели” са изключително важни в епидемиологията и клиничната медицина, а най-често използваният метод за тяхното създаване е линейната регресия.\nПроменливата, чиито стойности се предсказват в регресионния модел се нарича зависима (резултативна), докато променливата, която се използва за предсказване и построяването на модела се нарича независима (факторна). В своята същност, регресионния анализ достига до “уравнение” (математическа функция) чрез което в аналитичен вид се представя връзката между определен набор от фактори и резултативното явление. Регресионното уравнение се представя като:\n\\[{y} = {a} + {\\beta}\\cdot{x}\\]\n\n\nНека приемем за зависима променлива \\(y\\) - тегло на студентите от 2-ри курс, а за независима \\(x\\) - калорийния им прием. Чрез линейната регресия връзката между тези променливи може да се моделира, така че при известни стойности за калорийния прием, да предскажем теглото на студента. Регресионният модел следва формулата: \\({y} = {a} + {\\beta}\\cdot{x}\\), в която:\n\nКоефициентът \\({a}\\) е константа (intercept).\n\nСтойността коефициента показва, какво е теглото, когато калорийният прием е нула. С други думи, \\({a}\\) посочва началната точка на взаимовръзката между тегло и калорийния прием и на практика, няма практическо значение в интерпретацията на модела, тя служи единствено за математическото моделиране.\n\n\\({\\beta}\\) е регресионният коефициент.\n\nТова е число, което показва силата и посоката на връзката между предиктора (калорийния прием) и резултативната променлива (теглото). Математически, за установяване на стойността на \\(y\\), трябва да умножи регресионния коефициент \\({\\beta}\\) с известната стойност калорийния прием \\(x\\). Отрицателните стойности на \\({\\beta}\\) означават негативна (обратна) корелационна връзка, а позитивните стойности - позитивна (права)."

Въпреки това способността ни да изграждаме “причинно-следствени” вериги понякога ни “заблуждава”. Човешкият мозък е склонен да мисли за две явления като свързани, дори и в действителност такава връзка да липсва. Не бива да се смята, че статистическа и причинно следствена свръзка са едно и също понятие. Дори напротив, резултатите от статистическия анализ сами по себе си не могат да се разглеждат като изчерпателно доказателство в подкрепа на тезата за причинната обусловеност 1.\nВероятността дадена връзка да бъде причинно-следствена е по-голяма:\n\nКогато тя е по-силна и характеризира се с високи стойности за статистическите коефициенти;\nКогато тя е правдоподобна от биомедицинска гледна точка.

Express consent is generally preferable because it is unambiguous.\nImplied consent - Patients are normally considered to have given implied consent for sharing information within the healthcare team or with others providing their care.\nPersonal information - Information about people that doctors learn in a professional capacity and from which individuals can be identified. Such information is subject to a duty of confidentiality.\nIdentifiable information - Name, address and full postcode clearly identify a patient. Sometimes, pieces of information that itself are not identifiable may be combined and and enable full identification.\nHealthcare team - Comprises the people providing clinical services for a patient, and the administrative and other staff who support the provision of their care.\nDisclosure - The provision of access to information about a patient, regardless of the purpose.\nPublic interest disclosure - Exceptional circumstances that justify overriding the right of an individual to confidentiality in order to serve a broader social interest. Decisions about the public interest must take account of both the potential harm that disclosure may cause and the interests of society in the continued provision of a confidential health service.\nAnonymised information - Information from which individuals cannot reasonably be identified. Requires the removal of name, address, full postcode, identification numbers or any other detail or combination of details that might support identification.\nPseudonymised information - Information from which individuals cannot be identified by the recipient, but which enables information about different patients to be distinguished or to link information about the same patients over time. A ‘key’ might be retained by the service that coded the information so that it can be reconnected with the patient."

    "section": "When can confidentiality be overridden?",
    "text": "When can confidentiality be overridden?\nIf confidentiality is to be breached, there must be a good reason for doing so. The most common justifications are as follows:\n\nThe patient consents explicitly. The patient might well, for example, consent to their doctor informing a relative of their diagnosis.\nThe patient consents implicitly. For example, if a patient agrees to be referred to a consultant, they will be taken to have implicitly consented to the GP passing on medical information to the consultant. This exception can also apply to local clinical audits and similar standard hospital practice.\nIf the patient lacks mental capacity, then confidentiality can be breached if it is in their best interests to do so.\nThe disclosure is required by law. For example, doctors must register births and deaths: the patient has no right of opt-​out. Likewise, patients who receive fertility treatment or abortions also must be registered. Doctors are also required by law to inform the Health Protection Agency if their patients are suspected to be suffering from any of the conditions included in the list of ‘notifiable disease’. These include cholera, legionnaires’ disease, rabies, and whooping cough 1.\nThe disclosure can be justified in the public interest. This might be used where a patient poses a risk to others and disclosure is needed to protect other people from harm.\nPolice who are investigating a crime may obtain a judge’s permission to access medical notes. In such cases, the doctor is legally obliged to provide the information requested. Doctors are also required to disclose information that may prevent an act of terrorism, or that may help police in identifying the perpetrator of a driving offence.\n\nIn almost all jurisdictions, medical practitioners are required to breach confidentiality and report any information about the possible mistreatment or neglect of children. Again, the threshold for reporting is having an opinion, based on “reasonable suspicion or belief,” that abuse is taking place. Failure to report reasonable suspicions may be punishable by fine\nSometimes a physician may be asked by an employer to report on a patient’s fitness to return to work. The specific medical conditions of the patient do not have to be identified and ought not to be without the patient’s consent. More complicated situations arise where a physician acts as a “third party” examiner, such as for an insurance company requesting an independent medical examination of one of their clients. Even if the examination is done for third-party purposes, any suspicious or unanticipated findings with consequences for the patient’s welfare must be disclosed first to the patient and, only with their consent, to their own family doctor."

    "text": "Balancing benefits and harms\nA decision to disclose is often not based on the interests of the person concerned but is made to protect other people or the public at large. The decision to disclose is based partly on a balancing of several moral imperatives, including the risk and likelihood of harm if no disclosure is made, and the need to maintain the trust of the patient and the harms that may result from breach of confidence.\nHealth professionals can be in an invidious position in having to weigh speculative as well as known facts, and assess whether a perceived harm can be better averted by making a disclosure or by maintaining the trust of an individual while attempting to persuade him or her to disclose voluntarily.\nIn some cases, although a duty of confidentiality is owed, the need to protect other people may tip the balance. This may be the case, for example, when domestic violence occurs in a family where children are at risk. In many cases, however, clear and unambiguous information upon which to judge the potential threat is unavailable. Non-consensual disclosure is generally considered justifiable in cases where the threat appears serious, and disclosure is likely to limit or prevent it occurring."

An explicit request by a child that information should not be disclosed to parents or guardians, or indeed to any third party, must be respected save in the most exceptional circumstances, for example where it puts the child at risk of significant harm, in which case the disclosure may take place in the public interest without consent.\nWhere a health professional decides to disclose information to a third party against a child’s wishes, the child should generally be told before the information is disclosed.

    "text": "Are relatives entitled to information from the deceased’s medical record?\nFamily members have no legal right of access to the health records of the deceased patient. In practice, however,doctors have always had discretion to disclose information to a deceased person’s relatives or others for appropriate purposes when there is a clear justification. A common example is when the family requests details of the terminal illness because of an anxiety that the patient might have been misdiagnosed or there might have been negligence. Disclosure in such cases is likely to be what the deceased wanted and may also be in the interests of justice. Refusal to disclose in the absence of some evidence that this was the deceased patient’s known wish exacerbates suspicion and can result in unnecessary litigation. In other cases, the balance of benefit to be gained by disclosure to the family, for example of a hereditary or infectious condition, may outweigh the general obligation of confidentiality to the deceased. Information should not be disclosed if the patient gave it in the past with the specific understanding or expectation that it would be kept confidential. No information at all can be revealed if the patient requested non-disclosure except where there is a public interest justification."

    "text": "Case 5\nLate one night, the surgeon on call, Dr S., is asked to see Kaylee, a 16-year-old girl with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Her mother is present during the encounter. Kaylee’s history and exam are very typical for appendicitis. She reports her menstrual periods are regular, and she adamantly denies being sexually active. In the operating room at midnight, the appendix is found to be normal, but there is bleeding mass in her right fallopian tube, almost certainly an ectopic pregnancy. A gynecologist is called in and carries out a right salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube). After the procedure, Dr S. goes out to talk with Kaylee’s mother in the waiting room.\n\nWhat should Dr S tell Kaylee’s mother?\n\n\nCase 6\nYou are a family physician working in an inner-city drug rehabilitation clinic one day a week. One of your patients, Mr. H., admits to you that he has committed numerous robberies over the years to support his drug use. He even confesses that the police have mistakenly convicted another man for one of his crimes. Does this situation justify breaching patient confidentiality? What would you do?\n\n\nCase 7\nMs. K. is 29 years old and has epilepsy. Her driving license was revoked when she was first diagnosed with epilepsy and she has continued to have seizures every three to four months while on treatment. Ms. K mentions in passing to her physician that she sometimes drives short distances to get groceries. When her physician challenges her about this she says her seizures are very infrequent.\n\n\nCase 8\nThe phone on the ward rings. The nurse answers it. The caller asks how a particular patient is doing. Since the nurse knows the patient, she tells the caller that the patient has pneumonia on top of chronic bronchitis and that IV antibiotics have been started. On putting the phone down, you ask the nurse who called. She doesn’t know. What do you do?\n\n\nCase 9\nA case accompanied by photo material was presented at a conference. Personal details, current symptoms, past history of disease were given. What is the level of confidentiality beach in this case? Do you think that the patient’s consent is needed?\n\n\nCase 10\nYou have a new patient with a complex history who has been trying to get a copy of her record from her previous doctor. The other practice said she must provide them with a valid reason for why she needs the chart. You call the other doctor’s office trying to get the chart. The practice administrator informs you that the patient is extremely unpleasant and difficult. In addition, because the patient has not paid her bill the prior practice feels no obligation to provide you with the chart. The patient returns to see you the following day and asks what has become of her record. What do you tell her?\n\n\nCase 11\nPaula is 17 and has an inherited metabolic disease. She has been attending a specialist clinic on a yearly basis for monitoring. Sometimes Paula attends with her parents, although patients are encouraged to increasingly take an independent approach. At the latest appointment Paula specifically asked to speak to the consultant without her dad being present. She asked the consultant of the risks of developing a metabolic crisis associated with illicit drug use. She admitted that she occasionally uses recreational drugs. She insisted that her parents should not be informed of this and from previous conversations with her parents it is clear that they do not know of the drug use. The team has advised Paula about the implications and risks of her behaviour in terms of her health and the fact that it is illegal, but the consultant wonders whether he should inform Paula’s parents of her drug use.\n\n\nCase 12\nOne of your patients has recently died from ovarian cancer. She had presented to the surgery twice with vague symptoms prior to being referred for an ultrasound scan which demonstrated advanced cancer. Despite aggressive treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, she died less than 6 months after diagnosis. Her family is understandably distraught, and her daughter has written to the practice manager requesting a full copy of her medical records as they are wondering whether the cancer could have been diagnosed earlier. As the complaints lead for the practice, you have been asked to respond to the letter.\nQuestions\n\nDoes confidentiality continue after death?\nCan a relative request access to a patient’s medical records?\nWhat processes are in place to protect confidentiality and medical records?\n\n\n\nCase 13\nDoug is 51 and married with three adult children. He has been treated by his GP for depression for the last 7 years. More recently he has developed abnormal facial movements and spasms in his legs which are occurring at rest. The GP suspected that his low mood and lethargy over the past 7 years may be due to Huntington’s disease, which is now only becoming apparent with the onset of new clinical features. Doug was referred to a specialist for genetic testing, and sadly the result has come back positive and he has now been given a definite diagnosis of Huntington’s disease. Doug was adopted at birth and has no knowledge of his biological parents. He feels relieved that he was unaware that one of his parents would also have had the condition as he would not have wanted to find out his diagnosis before becoming symptomatic. Doug has told his wife, and together they have decided that they do not want any of their children to know about his diagnosis. They have been informed by the counsellor at the genetics clinic that their children might want to know because they each have a 50% chance of having the gene mutation. Although Doug and his wife have been offered support to share the difficult news with their children, they strongly resist telling them as they feel the knowledge would be a burden to them – ‘and what can they do about it anyway?’\n\nShould genetic information belong to individuals or families?\nDo Doug and his wife have an ethical obligation to tell their children they are at risk of a genetic condition?\nAre there any circumstances in which genetic information can be disclosed without their consent?\n\n\n\nCase 14\nPearl and Dean have been married for 12 years and have a 6-year-old son. Dean’s father and grandfather died from cancer when they were in their early 40s. Because of the strong family history of cancer, Dean wanted to have a genetic test to find out his level of risk. Although no clear diagnosis was possible, tests indicated that he was at risk of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Now Dean is feeling tired and unwell, and has a colonoscopy. The test reveals that he has inoperable bowel cancer. Pearl is concerned that their son might also be at risk of colon cancer when he is older, and she wants him to be tested to see if he is at risk.\nQuestions\n\nShould parents be allowed to have their children tested for adult-onset genetic conditions?\nDo children have a right to know about their genetic risks?"

    "text": "Definitions\n\nIllness - Refers to the actual manifestation of a pathological condition or disease in an individual. It encompasses the symptoms and signs experienced by the person and is often the reason for seeking medical attention or treatment.\nDisease - Describes a pathological condition or disorder that involves a disturbance in the normal functioning of the body or its organs. It may be characterized by specific symptoms, signs, or abnormalities that can be diagnosed by healthcare professionals through clinical examination, laboratory tests, or imaging studies.\nSickness - This term is often used interchangeably with illness or disease and generally refers to a state of poor health or being unwell. It can encompass both physical and mental aspects of health and well-being and may involve various symptoms, discomfort, or impairment of normal activities.\nMorbidity Iceberg - The Morbidity Iceberg, often referred to simply as the “Iceberg of Disease,” is a conceptual model used in epidemiology and public health to illustrate the discrepancy between reported or diagnosed cases of a disease and the actual total number of cases within a population. It is called an “iceberg” because, like an iceberg, only a small portion is visible above the surface, while the majority remains hidden beneath.\n\nVisible Portion: This represents the reported or diagnosed cases of a particular disease. These are the cases that have come to the attention of healthcare providers, typically through seeking medical care or through active surveillance by public health authorities. These cases are recorded in official health records and databases.\nHidden Portion: This refers to the undetected or unreported cases of the disease within the population. These cases may go unnoticed for various reasons, such as mild symptoms that do not prompt individuals to seek medical attention, lack of access to healthcare services, underdiagnosis by healthcare providers, or asymptomatic infections. Additionally, some cases may be misdiagnosed or not properly documented.\nFactors Contributing to the Hidden Portion:\n\nAccess to Healthcare\nDiagnostic Practices\nStigma and Social Factors\nAsymptomatic Cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Disease Iceberg. The visible part of the iceberg of disease is a collection of discovered and diagnosed diseases known to the health service. The invisible part is a collection of diseases for which medical assistance has not been sought.\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Diseases\n\nAbsolute Number of Cases - Has limited significance in epidemiology. It is useful for administrative purposes, but it does not provide a measure of the magnitude of the problem in the population.\nFrequency Coefficients - Two types of frequency coefficients are used in epidemiology: the incidence and the prevalence.\n\nIncidence - Measures the rate of occurrence of new cases of a disease in a defined population over a specified period.\nPrevalence - Measures the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time.\n\nProportions - Structural, extensive indicators where the numerator is a part of the denominator. Expressed as a percentage (%).\n\n\n\nMeasures of Exposure:\n\nRelative Risk\nAtributive Risk\nOdds Ratio\nRisk Difference (Attributable Risk)\nAttributable Fraction in the Exposed\nPopulation Attributable Risk\nPopulation Attributable Fraction\n\n\n\nDisease Incidence\n\nDefinition: Incidence is a dynamic measure that assesses the frequency of new cases of a disease during a specified period in a population at risk.\nTypes of Indicators:\n\nIncidence Rate: This indicator provides insight into the rate at which new cases of a disease occur within a population over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of disease or injury during a specified period by the total time each person was observed, summed for all individuals in the population at risk. This measure is often expressed per unit time (e.g., per 1,000 person-years). A higher incidence rate indicates a higher risk of acquiring the disease within the population.\\[I_{rate} = \\frac{new~cases~of~disease~or~injury~during~specified~period}{Time~each~person~was~observed~totaled~for~all~people}\\cdot{10}^n \\]\nCumulative Incidence: This indicator offers a broader perspective by measuring the proportion of individuals who develop the disease within the initial population at risk over a specified period. Also known as the attack rate or risk, cumulative incidence is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of disease or injury by the size of the population at the start of the period. This measure provides a clear understanding of the risk of developing the disease within a defined population during a specific timeframe. \\[CI = \\frac{New~cases~of~disease~or~injury}{Size~of~population~at~start~of~period}\\cdot{10}^n \\cdot t\\]\n\nSignificance:\n\nIncreased Incidence: An increase in disease incidence may indicate various factors such as strong acting risk factors (e.g., exposure to radiation, natural disasters), low levels of prevention (e.g., lack of vaccination, poor sanitation), or epidemiological outbreaks (e.g., infectious diseases). Monitoring changes in disease incidence can help identify emerging health threats and inform public health interventions.\nDecreased Incidence: A decrease in disease incidence may result from effective prevention strategies (primarily primary prevention) and the efficient organization of healthcare services. It indicates successful efforts in reducing the risk of disease within a population and improving overall health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nDisease Prevalence\n\nDefinition: Prevalence, sometimes referred to as the frequency of occurrence, represents the proportion of individuals in a given population who have a specific disease or condition at a particular point in time or over a specified period. Unlike incidence, which focuses solely on new cases, prevalence includes both new and pre-existing cases at a given moment. The formula for prevalence is \\[P= \\frac{all~new~cases~and~pre-existing~cases~of~disease~or~injury}{Population~during~the~same~time~period}\\cdot{10}^n\\]\nTypes of Indicators:\n\nPoint Prevalence: This indicator measures the proportion of individuals with a specific disease or condition on a particular date.\nPeriod Prevalence: This indicator measures the proportion of individuals with a specific disease or condition at any time during a specific interval.\n\nSignificance:\n\nDistinguishing Prevalence from Incidence:\n\nThe numerator of incidence consists only of individuals whose disease began within a specified interval.\nThe numerator of prevalence includes all individuals who have the disease for a specific reason during the specified interval, regardless of when the disease started. It includes not only new cases but also pre-existing cases, representing individuals who remained ill for some part of the specified interval.\n\nFactors Influencing Prevalence:\n\nIncreased Prevalence: Prevalence tends to increase with longer durations of diseases (chronic conditions), lower disease mortality rates, more effective therapies for maintaining health, increased exposure to risk factors, immigration of sick or predisposed individuals, emigration of healthy individuals, and advancements in diagnostic methods.\nDecreased Prevalence: Prevalence decreases with diseases with high mortality rates, acute conditions with rapid recovery, reduction in disease incidence, immigration of healthy individuals, and emigration of sick individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Exposure\n\n\nRelative Risk\n\nDefinition: Relative risk is a measure of the association between a particular disease or condition and the factor or exposure under investigation. It represents the ratio of the incidence of the disease among the exposed to the incidence of the disease among the unexposed group. It serves as a measure of the strength of the relationship between the factor and the disease. The values can range from 0 to + infinity.\nFormula: \\[RR = \\frac{I_{e}}{I_{unex}}\\]\nInterpretation:\n\nRelative Risk = 1 means that the incidence among the exposed is equal to the incidence among the unexposed, indicating no association between the exposure and the disease.\nA value greater than 1 indicates that the incidence among the exposed is higher compared to that among the unexposed, meaning that the exposure is a factor that increases the likelihood of developing the disease.\nA relative risk value less than 1 indicates a lower incidence among the unexposed, meaning that the exposure reduces the likelihood of developing the disease, indicating a protective effect.\n\n\n\n\nAtributive Risk\n\nDefinition: Attributable risk is the rate (proportion) of a disease or other outcome in exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure. This is a more useful term for public health purposes as it reflects the amount, usually expressed as a percentage, by which the risk of a disease is reduced by elimination or control of a particular exposure. Using attributable risk, it is possible to estimate the number of people spared the consequences of exposure, by subtracting the rate of the outcome (usually incidence or mortality) among the unexposed from the rate among the exposed individuals.\nFormula: \\[AR = I_{e} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if there were 6 deaths per 100 among smokers, and 1 death per 100 in non-smokers, the attributable risk would be 5 per 100. This assumes that causes other than the one under investigation have had equal effects on the exposed and unexposed groups.\n\n\n\nOdds Ratio\n\nDefinition: The odds ratio is a relative measure of risk that quantifies the likelihood of exposed individuals developing a disease compared to the likelihood of unexposed individuals developing the same disease. The odds ratio is a way to compare whether the probability of an event occurring is the same for two groups.\nFormula: \\[OR = \\frac{Odds_{e}}{Odds_{unex}}\\]\nInterpretation:\n\nIf the value is equal to 1, the probability of the event occurring is the same for both groups.\nA value greater than 1 indicates that the event is more likely to occur in the first group,\na value less than 1 indicates that the event is more likely to occur in the second group.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Difference (Attributable Risk)\n\nDefinition: The attributable risk, or risk difference, is the difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups, i.e., it assesses the excess morbidity in the exposed group due to the impact of the studied risk factor. The attributable risk quantifies the risk in the exposed group that is attributable to the exposure. It represents the portion of morbidity that could be reduced or eliminated by removing the exposure.\nFormula: \\[RD = AR = I_{e} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if the risk difference is 0.05, it means that 5 out of 100 individuals developed the disease as a result of the exposure.\nNumber Needed to Harm (NNH): This is the number of exposed individuals needed to develop one additional case of the disease. \\[NNH = \\frac{1}{RD}\\]\n\n\n\nEtiologic Fraction (EF) also attributable fraction in the exposed\n\nDefinition: The attributable fraction in the exposed represents the relative proportion of diseased individuals in the exposed group who developed the disease as a result of the impact of the studied risk factor.\nFormula:\n\n\\[EF = \\frac{I_{e} - I_{unex}}{I_{e}}\\]\n\n\nAlternatively, if incidence data are not available, the relative risk (RR) can be used to calculate the EF \\[EF = \\frac{RR - 1}{RR}\\]\n\nInterpretation: For example, if the attributable fraction in the exposed is 10%, it means that one-tenth of all diseased individuals in the exposed group developed the disease as a result of the impact of the studied risk factor.\n\n\n\nPopulation Attributable Risk (PAR)\n\nDefinition: The population attributable risk assesses the proportion of all cases of the disease in the entire population (both exposed and unexposed) that are attributable to the exposure or the action of the risk factor. It evaluates the excess morbidity in the entire population attributable to the risk factor.\nFormula: \\[PAR = I_{population} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, a study in the USA in 1986 showed that the incidence of lung cancer among non-smokers was 8.7/100,000 per year, while in the entire population, it was 72.5/100,000 per year. The PAR of 63.8/100,000 per year is a result of smoking.\n\n\n\nPopulation Etiologic Fraction (PEF)\n\nDefinition: The population etiologic fraction represents the relative proportion of morbidity in the entire population (both exposed and unexposed) that is a result of the action of the exposure.\nFormula: \\[PEF = \\frac{I_{population} - I_{unex}}{I_{population}}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if the population etiologic fraction is 88%, it means that 88 out of 100 cases of the disease in the entire population are a result of the action of the studied risk factor.\n\n\n\n\nRisk assessment indicators"

Their capacity may also fluctuate over time. Patients may give explicit or express consent orally, in writing or by other means of communication available to them. They may also imply consent non-verbally, for example by complying with the proposed examination or treatment.

    "text": "The process of seeking consent\nConsent is not a one-off event, it involves a process of information giving and explanation that facilitates informed decision making. It is essential that informing and involving patients, in a way that they can understand, is not seen as ‘additional’ to medical practice, but as an integral part of it. In much of healthcare, informed patients indicate their consent through actions, such as opening their mouth for examination, offering an arm for blood pressure to be taken or attending a doctor and giving information about an illness. Consent that is indicated in this way is often termed ‘implied’ consent and applies only to the immediate procedure, and not necessarily to subsequent tests or treatment that flow from it. However, acquiescence when a patient does not know what the intervention entails, or that there is an option of refusing, is not ‘consent’. Consent that is given orally, in writing or via other means of communication available to the patient, is known as ‘explicit’, or ‘express’, consent. A signed consent form is simply prima facie evidence that the process of information giving and explanation has taken place. It is the quality and clarity of the information provided, along with the capacity of the patient and the voluntariness of the consent given, which determine the its validity, rather than a signature on a piece of paper."

    "text": "Refusing to receive information\nIn most cases, doctors and patients decide together which treatment option would be the most appropriate. Doctors contribute their clinical knowledge and experience while patients bring their personal needs, preferences and values to the decision-making process. In some cases, however, patients do not want to know and ask their doctor to make the decision on their behalf. When this happens, doctors should try to find out why the patient feels this way, and explain the importance of knowing the options open to them and what the treatment will involve. Even if they continue to refuse, it is a legal requirement that basic information, such as what the treatment or procedure is intended to achieve and what it will involve, including any serious risks, be provided in order for consent to be valid. If patients insist that they do not want even this basic information, the doctor must explain the potential consequences of not receiving it; for example, their consent to the treatment or procedure may not be valid. Doctors must record the fact that a patient has declined basic information and make it clear to patients that they can change their minds and have more information at any time.\nWithout basic information, patients cannot make a valid choice to delegate responsibility for treatment decisions to the doctor. The amount of basic information needed depends upon the individual circumstances, the severity of the condition and the risks associated with the treatment. Some doctors ask patients to sign a form confirming that they were offered information but declined it, both in order to emphasize the importance of the decision the patient is taking and to protect the doctor against future charges of failing to provide sufficient information. Others record each discussion that takes place in the medical notes. Either way, it is important to have thorough documentation of the information refusal, and to do so in a form that is easily accessible to others providing care for the patient"

This is usually by recording contemporaneously in the health record that information has been provided and a discussion has taken place. In many cases, there is no need for patients to indicate their agreement in writing.\nWhere complex procedures are proposed, or there are significant risks associated with the procedure, consent forms are used to document the patient’s agreement. They are common, for example, in surgery.

    "text": "The scope of consent\n\nDuration\nConsent should be perceived as a continuing process rather than a one-off decision. Before beginning treatment, a member of the healthcare team should check that the patient still wants to go ahead. Doctors sometimes query the length of time for which consent is valid. In usual practice, this is not an issue because patients’ continued participation in treatment is an indication that they have not changed their minds. Occasionally, however, if treatment involves a number of invasive or complex procedures over a period of time, for example successive surgical interventions, it may be appropriate to ask for explicit, or even written, consent for each intervention. Sometimes there is a long period between the original consent being sought and the procedure being undertaken, during which time the patient’s condition or wishes may have changed, or new information may have become available. It is then important to reaffirm that the patient still consents to the procedure going ahead, even if no new information or explanations are needed. It is important that the patient is given continuing opportunities to ask further questions and to review the decision.\n\n\nExceeding consent\nConsent is valid only insofar as it applies to the treatment in question; so, for example, when a patient agrees to a surgical procedure, the surgeon cannot simply change their mind and perform a different or additional operation. If the patient signs a consent form for an operation on her left knee, you cannot, in the operating room, decide to operate on her right knee and assume that you have consent. If a patient signs a consent for an appendectomy, but when you open her up you find colon cancer, you cannot just do the colectomy without first informing the patient of the additional procedure and obtaining consent. There can be no presumption for consent for anything beyond what the patient specifically said they consented to. Either the patient has to sign consent in advance for the other procedures or they have to regain consciousness and have the additional procedure explained.\nThe only time when doctors are justified in proceeding without prior authority is when it is essential to do so immediately in order to save life or prevent a serious deterioration in the patient’s condition, and it is not possible to obtain that person’s consent."

    "text": "Informed refusal\nPatients are not obliged to justify their decisions to refuse treatment, but the healthcare team should ensure that patients base their decisions on accurate information and that they have corrected any misunderstandings. Just as patients giving consent should have sufficient accurate information, those refusing should ideally have an awareness of their condition, the proposed treatment, any significant risks or side effects, the probability of a successful recovery, the consequences of not having the treatment and alternative forms of treatment. Doctors must not put pressure on patients to decide in a particular way, but should allow them time to consider a decision with potentially serious consequences.\nA refusal of a particular treatment does not imply a refusal of all treatment or all facets of care. When a patient has refused treatment, alternative treatments and procedures intended to keep the patient comfortable and free from pain or discomfort should still be offered. In addition, patients are entitled to change their minds about a decision, including a refusal, at any time, so long as they have the capacity to do so. If there are circumstances in which not providing treatment at a given time would limit the options for providing treatment in the future, this should be made clear from the outset. For example, a cancer may be operable at the time a patient presents for treatment; if the patient refuses and then changes his or her mind a month later, the cancer might have progressed to a stage that is inoperable."

    "section": "Capacity to give valid consent",
    "text": "Capacity to give valid consent\nCompetence is a legal term. Competency decisions transpire within the judicial system. Only a court can determine that a patient is incompetent. All adult patients are considered competent unless specifically proven otherwise. Physicians can determine whether or not a patient has the capacity to understand their medical condition. The physician makes a determination of the capacity to comprehend patients medical problems based on whether there is an organic delirium due to a clinical condition such as hypoxia, drug intoxication, meningitis, encephalitis, or a psychiatric disorder. These determinations are based in large part on a neurological tests on memory, comprehension, reasoning, and judgment. Any physician can make this determination not only psychiatrist. However, psychiatrist may be useful in rendering decision-making capacity determinations in cases that are complex or equivocal. If the patient obviously does or does not have the capacity to understand, a psychiatrist is not needed.\n\nMinors\nBy definition, a minor is a person under the age of 18. With some exceptions, minors are generally not considered competent to make their own decisions. Only a parent or a legal guardian can give consent for a minor. Neighbors, aunts, uncles, and grandparents cannot give consent. This rule does not cover life-threatening or serious emergencies. Consent is always implied for emergency treatment. A physician should not withhold blood or surgery in a life-threatening accident just because the parent is not present.\nA small number of minors, particularly at older ages such as 16 or 17, may be considered “emancipated” or freed of the need to have parental consent for any medical care. The criteria are that the minor is married, self-supporting and living independently, in the military, or the parent of a child that they themselves support. The criteria for being an emancipated minor relate to being no longer dependent on one’s parents for support. In other words, if the minor does not live with their parents, has a job, and is self-supporting financially, then the minor no longer is dependent upon parental consent for his actions. An emancipated minor is free to make health-care decisions in all areas, not only just STDs, prenatal care, contraception, or substance abuse.\n\n\nPsychiastric patients\nAll suicidal patients are considered to lack capacity to understand because active suicidal ideation is deemed to be a sign of impaired judgment. In addition, the level of competence necessary to make financial decisions is different from that necessary for an informed refusal. In other words, a patient may have a history of bipolar disorder making it impossible for him to manage financial decisions. However, the same person might still be considered to have capacity to refuse treatment. There is a very limited demand placed on patients to establish capacity to refuse treatments.\n\n\nProxy decision making and the role of those close to the patient\nWhen patients lack the capacity to make decisions, others clearly need to make it on their behalf. Families and those close to the adult often feel that they are the natural decision makers, but the law is clear that they are only entitled to consent where they have been appointed as the patient’s proxy decision maker. Surrogate decision-making does not refer to the ethical principle of autonomy, but rather to the ethical principle of beneficence. When making a decision about a medical procedure for my child or for my elderly parents with dementia, one should not defend a decision that would be harmful. Children are not parents’ property, and parents share the duty to act in their best interests. The physician has the right and the duty to defend a child or another person with limited autonomy when a surrogate decision-maker acts against the patient’s best interests. In cases of disagreement, the interests of the child, or of another person with limited autonomy should prevail. The most appropriate resolution of such a disagreement is a rapid court decision.\n\n\nAdvanced Directives\nIn cases of limited autonomy, the patient’s advanced directive is the second possibility to support a medical decision. Advanced directives are a logical consequence of the clash between the widening options of modern medical technologies to prolong life, and the increasing awareness of the right to control one’s own life, here including dignity when approaching the end of life.\nElderly, or patients with severe chronic diseases often wish to express their preference regarding treatment in case of future incompetence and deterioration of their health. Since nobody can envision all possible future scenarios, the contents of such advance directives are usually quite broad and include statements such as refusal to be admitted to an intensive-care unit, or refusal of resuscitation.\nWhile advanced written directives remain rare in many countries (including Bulgaria), it is clear that this practice will become more common in future. Advanced directives may be written and signed, sometimes in the presence of a family physician. They may also be expressed orally, preferably in the presence of at least two witnesses. An advanced directive has no absolute validity. First, there is a time limit: many laws and regulations limit the validity of patients’ advanced directives to 5 years, after which the person should renew its validity. Physician should always strive to understand whether the patient really envisioned the current situation at the time when formulating an advanced directive. The nature of the current medical problem is important: while a successful antibiotic treatment of acute pneumonia may quickly return the patient to her previous state, such a scenario is clearly different from a decision to start long-lasting artificial ventilation. Even when presented with a clear advanced directive, the physician should speak to a frail patient and try to get his or her current preference."

    "title": "Epidemiology – definition, tasks, methods. Natural history of the disease",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Epidemiology - Definition\nEpidemiology is a medical science and practical approach that is an integral part of social medicine and public health. The word originates from the Greek - “epi” - above, “demos” - people, and “logos” - science. Epidemiology studies the causes of diseases and their distribution in the population. The definition is based on two fundamental assumptions: frist, the occurrence of diseases in populations is not a purely random process, and second, it is determined by causal and preventive factors\n\n\nHistorical Development of Epidemiology\n\nThe historical development of this science can be traced back to the time of Hippocrates. In his three books titled “Epidemics I”, “Epidemics III”, and “On Airs, Waters, and Places”, Hippocrates attempted to describe disease from a rational perspective rather than as a supernatural manifestation. He observed that different diseases occurred in different places and introduced concepts such as epidemics and endemics.\nHowever, the “father” of modern epidemiology is considered to be the English physician-anesthesiologist John Snow (1813–1858). While his name is associated with the application of chloroform for anesthesia, including for Queen Victoria, Snow is better known for his pioneering work in epidemiology. Twenty years before the development of the microscope, Snow conducted studies on cholera outbreaks to discover the cause of the disease and prevent its recurrence. As his work illustrates the classical sequence from descriptive epidemiology to hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing (analytical epidemiology), and application of knowledge in practical health measures, two of his studies will be described in detail.\n\nSnow conducted one of his famous investigations in 1854 when a cholera outbreak occurred in Golden Square, London. He began his investigation by determining where the cholera patients lived and worked in that area. He mapped out each residence on a map of the area. Believing that water was the source of cholera infection, Snow marked the locations of the water pumps on his map (designated with the Latin letters A, B, C). He then sought a connection between the distribution of households with cholera cases and the location of the pumps. He observed that more households with cholera cases were clustered around pump “A” - the Broad Street pump, than around pumps “B” or “C”. When he interviewed residents living in the vicinity of Golden Square, they told him they avoided pump B because it was heavily polluted, and pump C was inconveniently located for most of them. Based on this information, Snow concluded that the Broad Street pump (pump A) was the primary source of water for the region and the most likely source of infection for most cholera patients in the Golden Square area. However, he curiously noted that in the area of two blocks located east of the Broad Street pump, there were no cases of cholera. Upon investigation, Snow discovered that there was a brewery with a deep well located there. The brewery workers obtained water from this well, as well as a daily ration of malt alcohol. Access to these uncontaminated wells may explain why none of the brewery employees were infected with cholera. To confirm that the Broad Street pump was the source of the epidemic, Snow gathered information on where the cholera patients obtained water. Consumption of water from the Broad Street pump was the only common factor among cholera patients. After presenting his findings to municipal officials, despite some resistance, the pump was removed, and the pandemic outbreaks ceased. The site of the pump is now marked with a memorial plaque.\nSnow’s second investigation reexamines the data from the 1854 cholera epidemic in London. During the cholera epidemic a few years earlier, Snow noticed that areas with the highest mortality were served by two water supply companies: the Lambeth Company and the Southwark and Vauxhall Company. At that time, both companies obtained water from the River Thames at intake points located downstream from London, making them susceptible to contamination from London sewage, which was directly discharged into the river. To avoid contamination from London sewage, in 1852 the Lambeth Company relocated its intake to a location considerably upstream from London. Over a period of 7 weeks in the summer of 1854, Snow compared the cholera mortality rates in areas supplied by one or both water supply companies. Snow’s collected data showed that the cholera mortality was more than 5 times higher in areas served exclusively by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company (downstream intake from London) than in areas served only by the Lambeth Company (upstream intake from London). These data were consistent with the hypothesis that water obtained from the Thames below London was a source of cholera. To test his hypothesis regarding water supply, Snow focused on areas served by both companies, as households within these areas were usually comparable, except for the water supply company. In these areas, Snow first determined the water supply company for each household where a cholera death had occurred during the 7-week period. Upon analyzing the data, a higher cholera mortality was found among households served by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, supporting Snow’s hypothesis. This systematic approach has actually been used by modern epidemiologists to investigate disease outbreaks. Following this investigation, efforts to control the epidemic were directed towards relocating the water intake of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company to avoid sources of contamination. In this way, without knowledge of microorganisms, Snow demonstrated that water could serve as a means of transmitting cholera and that epidemiological information could be used to guide prompt and appropriate public health actions.\n\n\n\n\nConcepts\n\nEpidemiology may be considered as minor to physical sciences because it does not investigate the biological mechanism leading from exposure to disease as, for example, toxicology does. However, the ability of identifying modifiable conditions that contribute to health outcomes without identifying the biological mechanisms or the agent(s) that lead to these outcomes is a strength of epidemiology: It is not always necessary to wait until the underlying mechanism is completely understood in order to facilitate preventive action. This is illustrated by the historical examples of the improvements of environmental hygiene that led to a reduction of infectious diseases like cholera that was possible before the identifciation of vibrio cholerae.\nWhat distinguishes epidemiology is its perspective on groups or populations rather than individuals. It is this demographic focus where statistical methods enter the feild and provide the tools needed to compare different characteristics relating to disease occurrence between populations. Epidemiology is a comparative discipline that contrasts occurrence of diseases and characteristics between different time periods, different places, or different groups of persons. The comparison of groups is a central feature of epidemiology, be it the comparison of morbidity or mortality in populations with and without a certain exposure or the comparison of exposure between diseased subjects and a control group. Inclusion of an appropriate reference group (non-exposed or non-diseased) for comparison with the group of interest is a condition for causal inference.\n\n\n\nApplication of Epidemiological Knowledge\nEpidemiological knowledge concerns populations. There are two ways to use this knowledge. The frist is group-oriented: It consists in applying knowledge about a specifcic population directly to this population itself. This is part of public health. The conceptually simplest applications of this kind concern the planning of the health system and of health strategies. The second path is taken when we are confronted with an individual person, typically in a clinical setting: We can then regard this person as a member of a population for which relevant epidemiological knowledge is available and deal with her or him accordingly.\n\n\nDifference between Epidemiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases\n\nUnlike the specialty of “Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases” (EID), general epidemiology (GE) focuses on one population.\nIn general epidemiology, risk factors are understood as elements with an increased risk of developing a disease, while EID considers the infected individual as a “risk factor” for others.\nEssentially, GE attempts to discover the causes of diseases and assess their impact on the population, while in EID, the causes are known (infectious agent).\n\n\n\nObjectives of Epidemiology\nEpidemiology pursues three major objectives:\n\nto describe the spectrum of diseases and their determinants\nto identify the causal factors of diseases\nto apply this knowledge to prevention and public health practice.\n\n\n\nTasks of Epidemiology:\n\nIdentifying risk factors that influence health and providing scientific support for health promotion and prevention.\nDetermining the significance and priority of various factors affecting health.\nIdentifying populations at risk for specific diseases.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic programs.\nStudying the natural course of diseases.\nRegistering and tracking the frequency of diseases.\nInvestigating disease outbreaks (“epidemic”) requires examining the extreme acting risk factor.\n\n\n\nNatural History of Disease\n\nDefinition - The natural history of disease represents a simplified model of the development of a disease from the moment of exposure to the risk factor to the final stage of chronicity, death, or recovery. The natural history (NH) of disease is one of the fundamental concepts in epidemiology. NH includes the following stages:\nStages:\n\nFirst Stage - susceptibility stage. This stage occurs before a person develops a certain disease. During this stage, the individual is susceptible to the disease but has not yet been exposed to the risk factor.\nSecond Stage - exposure stage. During this stage, the individual is exposed to the risk factor. The risk factor may act with a small dose and over a prolonged period (occupational risk factors - microclimate, vibrations; smoking) or with a very high dose over a short period (poisoning, radiation, electric shocks).\nThird Stage - asymptomatic period. During this stage, the individual does not exhibit symptoms but has developed the disease. In this stage, the individual may fully recover without seeking contact with the healthcare system. In infectious diseases, the individual may be infectious during this period. Usually, this period ends with the onset of clinical symptoms, prompting the seeking of medical assistance.\nFourth Stage - clinical diagnosis. In this stage, the individual seeks medical help. For some diseases, the clinical diagnosis may be made based solely on clinical symptoms, while for others, additional diagnostic procedures (laboratory, radiological, tomographic, biopsy, etc.) may be necessary. This period can be exceptionally long for some rare diseases or clinical entities not described until now. In 30% of cases, a diagnosis may not be made due to a lack of sufficient medical knowledge in the field.\nFifth Stage - disease development. During this period, after diagnosis, the individual begins etiological, pathogenetic, and/or symptomatic treatment. The disease develops according to the specifics of the organism and the effectiveness of the applied therapy.\nSixth Stage - Outcome of the disease. During this period, the individual may fully recover, partially recover - with limited functional abilities (chronification), or pass away.\n\nApplication of the Natural History of Disease\n\nDevelopment of preventive programs. Understanding the natural history of a disease can help determine the stages of the disease where interventions can be most effective in preventing its spread. For example, if the disease has a long latent period, interventions aimed at detecting and treating the disease during this stage can be effective in preventing transmission.\nEffective treatment. Knowing the natural history of a disease can help healthcare providers choose appropriate treatment at each stage of the disease. For example, medications may be more effective in the early stages of the disease than in later stages when irreversible damage may occur.\nPrognosis for disease outcome. Understanding the natural history of a particular disease can help predict the likely outcome for each patient depending on their personal characteristics and health status. This information can be used to make treatment decisions and to counsel patients and their families.\nDisease control. Understanding the natural history of a disease is essential for developing strategies to control or eliminate the disease. For example, in the case of an infectious disease, identifying the stages of the disease where transmission is most likely can serve as information for interventions aimed at controlling its sprea."

Важно: Смъртността се различава от леталитета - при леталитета в знаменателя са болните, а при смъртността - цялото население [5].\nЗаболеваемостта представлява съотношението на броя новозаболели от дадено заболяване (например от рак на гърдата) спрямо популацията в риск (всички, които биха могли да се разболеят от това заболяване).\nВ ежедневната практика като лекари също ще ползвате интензивни показатели.

Защо да предпочетем едната спрямо другата? Какво е правилото?\nВсъщност няма особено значение точно коя структура се избира. Разбира се, числата след стандартизация зависят от избора и те биха се различавали. От значение обаче е разликата, а не конкретните стойности на стандартизиран леталитет в двете групи3.\nКакво обаче е стандартът?\nАко изберем за стандарт групата на неваксинираните, за да изчислим стандарта - ще използваме броя на участниците във всяка възрастова група за числител, а общия брой неваксинирани за знаменател. Полученият коефициент е “стандарт” за конкретната възрастова група [1].\nВ Таблица 4 са представени получените стандарти.\nНеваксинираните участниците под 24 год. са 4000, а общият брой неваксинирани 8000. Стандартът за тази група е 0.5 (ако умножим по 100 ще получим 50%). Това е стандартът за тази група, който обаче ще използваме и за ваксинираните.\nМоже да ви направи впечатление, че сборът на всички стандарти е равен на 1-ца (тоест 100%).

За сметка на това стандартизираните се събират. Когато ги съберем получаваме общия стандартизиран леталитет, който е “изчистен” от замъгляващия ефект на различната възраст в двете групи. С други думи, показателите след стандартизация представят какъв би бил леталитетът, ако двете групи имаха еднаква възрастова структура [1,7].\n\n\nСтъпка 4: Заключение\nНека извършим тази последна калкулация.\nЗа групата на ваксинираните общият стандартизиран леталитет е:\n\n25 % (стандартизираният леталитет за всички до 24 г.) + 15 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 25-34 г.) + 8,7 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 35-44 г.) + 10 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група над 45 г.). Общо за всички ваксинирани, стандартизираният леталитет е 58.7%\n\nЗа групата на неваксинираните общият стандартизиран леталитет е:\n\n30 % (стандартизираният леталитет за всички до 24 г.) + 17,5 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 25-34 г.) + 10 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 35-44 г.) + 11,25 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група над 45 г.). Общо за всички неваксинирани, стандартизираният леталитет е 68.75%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionЗаключение\n\n\n\n\n\nСтандартизираните показатели за леталитет в двете групи са съответно 58.75 % и 68.75 %. Леталитетът сред неваксинираните е с 10 % по-висок.\n\n\n\n\nСтандартизираните показатели позволяват да се анализира и оцени нивото на изучаваното явление при създадени условия на еднородност, тоест методът ни показва какви биха били коефициентите в сравняваните групи, ако те имаха еднакъв състав [1]."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Doctors have been concerted with ethics since the earliest days of medical practice. Traditionally, medical practitioners have been expected to be motivated by a desire to help their patients. Ethical codes and systems, such as the Hippocratic oath, have emphasized this.\nDuring the latter half of the twentieth century, advances in medical science, in conjunction with social and political changes, meant that the accepted conventions of the doctor-patient relationship were increasingly being questioned. After the Nuremberg trials, in which the crimes of Nazi doctors, among others, were exposed, it became clear that doctors cannot be assumed to be good simply by virtue of their profession.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthics is a study of morality and defining what is right or wrong. One’s first experience with ethics comes from family, religion, background, historical perspective, personal training, and education.\n\n\n‘Medical ethics’ is one subset of the broader disciplines of ‘healthcare ethics’ and ‘bioethics’. It overlaps with both but focuses on the duties of doctors. The original Greek and Latin expressions for ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ conveyed the same idea of a code of conduct acceptable to a particular group.\nNowadays,‘ethics’ can either mean conforming to recognized standards of practice or describe the general study of morality. Traditionally, professional ethics was what doctors defined for themselves, from their own perspective. Their duty was to work to the standards established by their peers and avoid any action that would bring the profession into disrepute. Ethics, in this sense, has always been a central concern of medicine.\nThe key difference between bioethics and medical ethics is that bioethics generally is concerned the moral principles of all biomedical technologies, such as cloning, stem cell therapy, xenotransplantation and the use of animal models in research while medical ethics is more specific and focused on everyday clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequentialism, as its name suggests, is a theory whose focus is purely on the outcome of an action. For a consequentialist, the only question to be asked when seeking a moral reason for doing something is ‘What is the result?’ The most famous form of consequentialism is utilitarianism: ‘an act is morally right if it maximizes the good’ (the terms consequentialism and utilitarianism are commonly used interchangeably).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUtilitarian Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the available means, act in such a way as to do as much good as possible\n\n\n\nThe basic principle of utilitarian ethics is do good, which is the oldest and most straightforward ethical principle. Utilitarian ethic is useful primarily in catastrophic situations. In times of war, earthquakes, or other major accidents, we have to save as many lives as possible in the shortest amount of time with very limited means. In a rational triage, one would group the wounded into those with minor wounds and injuries who can wait and those who require that we urgently stop their bleeding, clear their airways or prevent further aggravation of their health condition. Utilitarian ethics also offers appropriate advice to activities in the field of public health and preventive medicine.\nConsequentialism makes no distinction between acts and omissions. The outcome of choosing not to do something is just as significant for a consequentialist as the outcome of an act that one has chosen to perform. This means that the scope of our moral obligations may seem unfeasibly large1\nAnother counterintuitive aspect of consequentialism is its apparent imperviousness to considerations of justice. Suppose that we knew for a fact that capital punishment functions effectively as a deterrent: for each person executed, five murderers are deterred. To save resources, we might seize upon any random person, decree that they are the murderer, and execute them. Not only would this have the same deterrent effect, but it would also save police time and money since they would not need to track down the real culprit. A consequentialist would not worry about this, since the overall outcome may be deemed to outweigh the fact that one innocent person has been killed. But for many people, the injustice committed on the innocent man outweighs the beneficial consequences.\n\n\n\nCommunitarianism focuses on the fact that people have responsibilities as well as rights. It advocates policies based on consensus rather than compromise. It asserts that individuals need to concentrate not only on their own rights, but also their responsibilities to people close to them and to community. Communitarian arguments expect a concern for others to be taken into account when decisions are made. This approach comes to the fore when considering the health of communities rather than individuals. It is particularly relevant to public health ethics, genetics and any situation in which an important factor is the interrelatedness of individuals and of their interests.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘deontology’ stems from the Greek for ‘duty’. In contrast to consequentialism, a deontologist approaches ethical questions by identifying and adhering to predefined moral rules, or duties. Once we have established what our duty is, we must perform it, regardless of what the outcome may be. However, this raises the question of how we establish what our duties are.\nThe German philosopher Immanuel Kant argues that we can establish our moral duty purely through the exercise of reason without having to derive them from any theological source. This is known as ‘the categorical imperative’. To achieve this, Kant urges that in all of our decisions we should always behave in such a way that we could will for what we do to become a universal law. This means that we cannot treat our own interests as being superior to those of others. It also means that moral duties are consistent and non-arbitrary - they apply to everyone equally.\nIn utilitarian ethics, the most prominent status is given to the principle of beneficence. Kantian ethics, however, leads us to appreciate the individual, one’s free will, and rational responsibility for one’s decisions - the most important is, therefore, the ethical principle of the respect for autonomy. By requiring one to follow, without exception, universal rules, Kant excluded emotions and interpersonal relations from entering ethical reflections. Even more: an act is ethical only if the motivation comes from the general rule. If done from fear or love, the ethical value of the same act is neutral. In Kantian ethics, there is no place for compromise and no weighing of motivations for acting against the consequences, regardless of how predictable, and thus avoidable, the latter could be.\n\n\n\nIn ethical assessment, utilitarians look at the consequences of a particular act, and deontological ethicists at the conformity of the act with pre-defined rules. Virtue ethics stands in a different position: it’s foundation is the ethical characteristics of a person. Certain personal characteristics are recognized as virtues2 and others as vices. Honesty, generosity, compassion, courage, justice, fidelity, and veracity are virtues that characterize an ethical person, while deception, selfishness, cruelty, infidelity, and disingenuousness are some of the many characteristics that denote a vicious person.Virtue ethics is now regarded as being one of the three key moral theories, along with consequentialism and deontology.\nHowever, virtue ethics requires fundamentally that we have an idea of what the virtues are, and this can be difficult to establish. Certainly, Aristotle’s idea of the virtues does not necessarily harmonize with twenty-first century values. (Along with many other Greeks of his time, Aristotle thought that keeping slaves was perfectly compatible with being virtuous, and believed that women were intrinsically inferior to men.)\nVirtue ethics may be seen as an upgrading of utilitarian and deontological ethics. While virtues are in a central position, the incorporation of practical wisdom also rings consequences into virtue ethics. The rules of deontological ethics are important, yet not unbreakable. Finally, the main advantage of virtue ethics over the other two theories is that it includes human relations, and indeed gives a central position to them, a factor that has a decisive role in the practical reasoning of all of us.\n\n\n\nAnother practical approach is to use narrative or storytelling in order to give the problem context and clarify the ethical crux of it. This has been described as ‘the oldest way of exploring and expounding ethical issues’ through myth, parable or biography. It approaches problems by looking at the patient’s situation as a whole rather than considering a particular facet in isolation. It can involve an overview of the patient’s life, values and experiences of illness. Different health professionals and family members may present the picture from different angles and considering the same dilemma from such various viewpoints provides a way of ensuring that all relevant perspectives and perceptions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are influenced by ethics, the two can contradict one another in a healthcare setting. Law is based on explicit, written norms with a clear system for enacting such norms. Legal norms (approved international agreements, national constitutions, laws, and regulations) are organized hierarchically, should be mutually consistent, have a clearly defined spatial scope of their enactment, and can only apply to actions committed after the legal norm has been enacted. When an individual violates a specific legal norm, clearly defined procedures for establishing guilt and prescribed sanctions are in place.\nSometimes,legal duties as a healthcare professional can conflict with ethical responsibilities. The law may force ones do things their ethics just don’t condone. Or ones may want to do something because it’s ethical, but the law isn’t on their side.\n\n\n\n\nExisting ethical theories do not necessarily give easy answers to moral problems and, indeed, can yield counterintuitive results if pushed to their logical extremes. There is also the problem that moral values differ according to culture and context. What if the doctor is a deontologist, and the patient a consequentialist? Increasingly, in modern medicine, doctors may be treating patients who speak a different language, come from a different country, or practise a different religion. In short, patients’ values may be radically different from those of the doctor, and those of one doctor may differ from those of their colleagues.\nThe ‘four principles’ approach was developed partly in response to this problems, however the approach is not an ethical theory per se. Rather, it attempts to set out certain key considerations which are independent of social, cultural, or religious contexts. Since its inception in the twentieth century, the four principles approach has become extremely influential and is now the dominant framework for medical ethics teaching.\nThe principles in question are:\n\nAutonomy of the individual\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\nAs suggested, these principles are more properly understood as a distillation of other ethical theories, synthesized and reformatted for use in the medical setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAutonomy\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding information to patients and allowing them to make their own decisions\n\n\n\nAutonomy means self-governance: making and carrying out one’s own decisions. The importance of respect for autonomy is implicit or explicit in nearly all moral theories. With changing social expectations and, arguably, less hierarchical social and political structures, respect for autonomy has grown in importance, and is regarded by some as the cornerstone of the four principles. Autonomy is at the root of many of the fundamental requirements of good medical practice.\nThe autonomy of the individual includes the right to being informed (for there is no autonomy without information) and the right to confidentiality and privacy (otherwise other parties might influence an individual’s decisions without considering his or her will).\nThe principle of respect for autonomy is not absolute, but there is heated debate about how and when it should be overridden by other principles. What does seem clear is that it will inevitably clash with one or more of the other three principles at times. Resolving these clashes is one of the major preoccupations of medical ethicists and medical practitioners.\n\n\n\nBeneficence is the act of helping people, or benefiting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBeneficence\n\n\n\n\n\nUndertaking actions intended to benefit the patient\n\n\n\nBeneficence encapsulates what many people regard as the essence of medicine. Doctors are not here to function as servants, mechanics, shopkeepers, or teachers for their patients. Rather, their unique and special role is to help people, cure disease, relieve distress and suffering, prolong lives, and improve health. It has been argued that in this respect, doctors are radically different from other professionals.3\nAs medical technology and life-preserving interventions have proliferated, it has become evident that patients and doctors have extremely divergent views on the beneficence of life-prolonging measures. Some argue passionately for the continuance of treatment, while others argue that there are situations in which the patient cannot be benefited by being kept alive. Problems arise when a patient’s view of what is ‘beneficent’ differs from that of the doctor. We have seen that respect for autonomy is an essential component of the four principles. But a doctor may find it difficult, if not impossible, to respect the autonomy of a patient whose concept of beneficence is radically different\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is the principle of preventing or avoiding harm to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nActing so as to avoid harming the patient\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is sometimes regarded as the primary ethical principle to which doctors should adhere. It features in the Hippocratic oath, and it reappears in the common phrase ‘primum non nocere’ (from Latin: first, do no harm). The importance of this principle stems largely from the recognition that those same skills which allow a doctor to improve a patient’s health or well-being, can in themselves cause damage, pain, or sickness. Yet the injunction ‘first do no harm’ is perhaps too extreme. After all, if this really were a doctor’s first and primary obligation, they would not be able to do anything at all. It is impossible to think of any medical procedure or intervention that is entirely without risk. A simple vaccination causes harm by puncturing the skin; even screening may cause harm in the form of anxiety or a false-positive result. For this reason, it is clear that non-maleficence cannot function as medicine’s primary principle; rather, it serves as a balance against beneficence. Beneficence is an active principle - it calls for doctors to intervene to benefit their patients. Non-maleficence is a passive and cautionary principle that reminds doctors to think about the harm they may cause by intervening.\nQuestions of how to interpret “harm” also arise in the public health context. In recent years, some criticisms have been raised regarding breast screening. Frequently, screening programmes are justified on the ground that they save lives by detecting diseases which might otherwise have gone unnoticed until too late. However, in the breast screening context, it has been suggested that the screening programme causes excessive and unjustified interventions. In short, it causes harm. Some patients have biopsies only to discover there was nothing wrong. Others may have cancer detected, but in circumstances where the disease would never have become symptomatic. For example, if a very elderly patient has a very slow-growing cancer, it is highly unlikely that it will kill her. The question of whether such inadvertent harms outweigh the benefits of screening programmes is fraught. These problems, of course, also affect other moral theories that rely on concepts of harm, in particular consequentialism\n\n\n\nJustice is the principle of treating others fairly, avoiding discrimination and distributing resources equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding discrimination, distributing re- sources fairly\n\n\n\nJustice differs from the three principles already discussed. Autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence are highly patient centred. However, most moral theories recognize that the individual is not the sole ethical concern. By its very nature, ethics is a social phenomenon, meaning that questions of fairness come into play. There are two primary ways in which the principle of justice affects ethical decision-making in medicine. Firstly, there is the issue of how other people may be affected by a particular decision. Secondly, there is the question of discrimination: do some patients receive better or worse treatment than others?\nTo comply with the requirements of justice, it is important that decision - making is transparent and consistent. This can be difficult in complex healthcare systems, serving patients whose needs and values vary widely.\nThe other facet of justice is discrimination. It is often assumed that discrimination is intrinsically wrong. Yet, if we never discriminated, we would be unable to function at all. Remembering Aristotle’s injunction, ’treat equals equally and unequals unequally’, it is clear that discrimination in itself is not a problem. It would be unjust to treat a patient with a broken neck exactly the same as one with a broken finger. Where needs are different, we should treat people differently. This involves discriminating: noticing those differences and making decisions accordingly.\nDiscrimination is only a problem when it is unjust. We have suggested it is appropriate to discriminate between patients with different needs; however, if it were decided that only dark-haired patients would be treated, this would clearly be unjust, since there is no connection between hair colour and need for treatment. The challenge, therefore, is to be able to recognize what are, and what are not, the sorts of inequalities that justify treating people differently\n\n\n\n\nReal ethical dilemmas are those for which every possible action (including the omission of action) brings some ethical costs to a person, or to a group of people involved. Ethical analysis begins with a list of persons involved and then explores, for each of them, the ethical benefits and costs of a certain action according to the four ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. In this way, two or more possible actions with their ethical benefits and costs are compared. Ethical analysis does not automatically lead to the recommended action; rather, it is a practical approach to analyse a dilemma, identify the problematic aspects of each of the possible actions, and alleviate the related ethical costs.\nIf an act exists that will benefit all concerned and will not offend anybody, including oneself, then ethics or ethical analysis is not needed. Ethical consideration is also not applicable to situations in which the actor has no choice. Very often, however, we do have a choice; nevertheless, each act brings some benefits and some burdens to the persons whom the act involves.\nEthical analysis is helpful in such situations. The three steps of ethical analysis are:\n\nA list of possible actions\nList of persons or groups of persons whom the actions concern\nPreparing a table with rows for each person or group of persons concerned and columns for the four ethical principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco, aged 3, was seriously hurt in a traffic accident. Upon arrival to the intensive-care unit, he is in severe hemorrhagic shock. His father, a Jehovah’s Witness, prohibits blood transfusion, even after being told that immediate blood transfusion, followed by an operation is the only possibility for survival. The physician has to decide whether he will order blood transfusion or follow the father’s demand.\n\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are blood transfusion against the father’s will or no transfusion.\nThe persons involved are Marco, his family, and the physician. In addition, we will also add to the list the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses since they might be hurt if they learn that their religious belief was ignored. This brings us to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco’s family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysician\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s\nWitnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician’s decision to apply blood transfusion against the father’s will is to be compared to the alternative option - no transfusion, which would almost certainly lead to Marco’s death. We will now insert ethical benefits, marked with a “+”, and ethical costs, marked with a “−”. Assessment of ethical benefits and costs is clearly subjective; however, subjectivity is an unavoidable characteristic of every ethical deliberation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n?\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nMarco’s family\n---\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nPhysician\n+++\n++\n++\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n–\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the ethical benefits of a transfusion against the father’s demand greatly outweigh the ethical costs. The physician in the intensive-care unit has to make decisions without delay which gives Marco a chance for survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian, aged 12, has been treated for neuroblastoma for two years. Despite intensive treatment with three lines of cytotoxic drugs, he is now in relapse. Physicians agree that there is no indication for further active treatment and recommend only supportive and palliative treatment. Due to anaemia, Damian is weak and dizzy. A blood transfusion might lead to short-term improvement of his symptoms but clearly cannot reverse the course of the disease. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, his parents refuse blood transfusion.\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are a transfusion against the parents’ will or no transfusion. The persons involved are Damian, his family, the physician, and the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Here is the table, as prepared for the decision to order blood transfusion against the will of the parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nDamian\n--\n?\n+\n?\n\n\nDamian’s family\n---\n--\n--\n---\n\n\nPhysician\n+\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n---\n---\n--\n---\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the transfusion brings very few benefits and severe ethical costs, which no lengthy explanation can reduce. As a teenager, Damian understands the religion in which he was raised. For the parents, the extremely painful experience of the imminent death of their child would be even worse due to a lack of respect from physician’s side. Their sorrow and anger might spread to the whole community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.\nIt is clear that ethical analysis involves both ethical and professional arguments and it is a strong tool against one-sided presentation of ethical dilemmas. Attention to a single dimension, most often to respect for individual autonomy, should not obscure the ethical benefits and costs for other persons whose interests are also at stake. It is clear that ethical benefits and costs are subject to individual interpretation. Ethics is not mathematics, and conclusions from an ethical analysis may be debatable, based on different professional arguments. Thus, ethical analysis does not provide a single answer, but rather a framework for balancing and reaching a rational conclusion.\n\n\n\nTen medical students are learning how to perform rectal examinations. This is important for their education. However, no one likes undergoing a rectal examination unnecessarily. To ensure that students get the necessary practice, the consultant who is teaching them is trying to decide whether to allow these ten students to practise a rectal examination on 96-year-old anaesthetized woman who is undergoing surgery for an unrelated issue. The woman, who has mental capacity, has not been informed nor has she given consent. Is this ethically acceptable?\n\n\nPerforming a medical procedure on a patient who has not agreed to this may seem deceptive. Doctors are usually expected to be honest and trust-worthy and act with integrity. These are virtues that are explicitly required by the General Medical Council (GMC). Nevertheless, students may be well motivated in wanting to carry out the procedure: doing so should enable them to be better doctors in future. It seems reasonable to suppose that no one has ill intentions towards the patient in question; the procedure is not intended to harm her, and she need never know what has been done to her. However, a wise consultant may be able to exercise a more discerning judgement. Although no ill intention is involved, harm may come to the patient. Such harm, if she was not asked for her consent, will come as a shock. Though a very low-risk procedure, a rectal examination is something that carries a strong taboo in our society. The patient if she discovers she has undergone this may feel outraged or violated. We can never be entirely sure that a patient will not discover something we would prefer was kept secret. The patient’s virtues should also be considered here. If she had been asked, and had agreed to let the students examine her, this would have been a virtuous decision on her part. However, if the students examine her without her knowledge or consent, she has no opportunity to exercise virtue.\n\n\n\nFor a consequentialist, the question of whether the patient agrees to undergo the procedure is irrelevant. As long as she never finds out, no harm is done. If the action benefits ten medical students, this may be enough. Although, of course, it would be different if the procedure causes the patient harm (as it might on a 96-year-old patient), then the procedure could not be justified. However, a utilitarian must also consider the harm that might arise if the patient does find out - the patient may be distressed and angry. Patient negative experience could outweigh the benefit to the medical students. There are also broader harms and benefits to consider. If patients learn that they may be ‘practised on’ while under anaesthetic, they may lose trust in hospitals. But if no one ever finds out, perhaps overall large numbers of patients could benefit, since students will have the chance to improve their skills. If we could be 100% certain that the patient would never find out, the consequentialist would be completely happy to advise the ten students to proceed with their examination\n\n\n\nIt should immediately be apparent that a deontologist would not allow medical students to practise on an unconscious patient without her consent. This would be disregarding her autonomy, as well as being deceptive. However, would obtaining consent in advance make a difference, given that students would still be ‘using’ the patient for their own practice? Given the previous points about autonomy and consent, it seems plausible that a deontologist would be happy for the students to practise on the patient if she had consented in advance. If the patient consents, she shares in the ends of the students, that is, their desire to become better doctors, and this becomes one of her own ends.\n\n\n\nClearly, performing examinations on a patient without her consent is not in keeping with respect for autonomy. However, if this is known to be a teaching hospital, perhaps we could assume that consent to training is implied by this patient’s presence in the hospital. If so, then the procedure may not be deemed to breach the patient’s autonomy at all.\nOne might argue that the procedure is non-maleficent, and could even be beneficent if by chance it picks up something that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. It could also be argued that the broader benefits of carrying out such training in terms of improving population health could be taken to outweigh the other principles, that is, justice might decree that all patients should be willing to undergo this kind of thing for the sake of a wider population benefit.\nHowever, there are a number of issues to consider here. The first issue is whether it is reasonable to infer consent from a patient’s presence in a teaching hospital. Doctors often make this argument, but it is highly questionable. Many members of the public may not be aware of whether their nearest hospital is a teaching hospital or not. Even if they are, there is no reason to assume that they will know that this means they will be exposed to students’ examinations. Therefore, unless the patient has been explicitly consulted, it is not reasonable to suppose that she has somehow consented to being examined while under anaesthetic.\nThe arguments related to beneficence and non-maleficence likewise seem weak when probed further. It is unlikely that the examinations will cause harm; yet there is always some degree of risk and this may be exacerbated by the patient’s anger and distress if she feels she’s been abused or deceived.\nThe question about beneficence is very significant here. Some patients do not wish to know if they have a particular condition, and would choose not to attend screening programmes for this reason. The know-ledge of having a serious medical condition, though regarded as beneficial by many people, can be regarded as harmful by others. This is why people are offered screening, rather than being compelled to participate. If something sinister were identified in this woman, we do not know if she would be grateful or angry and upset about having been denied a choice.\nFinally, it is undoubtedly an admirable thing to participate in research or training. Surprisingly many patients are willing to do this when asked directly. Their choice to be involved may be described as truly altruistic. But when no choice is given, the act is not altruistic. There may also be questions to ask about why this patient in particular is being selected for this training. This is where considerations of justice can be extremely useful in identifying hidden ethical problems. What role is this patient’s age playing here? Has she been chosen as an ‘easy’ option?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n-/?\n-\n+\n---\n\n\nStudents\n+\n---\n+++\n+"

    "text": "Ethics is a study of morality and defining what is right or wrong. One’s first experience with ethics comes from family, religion, background, historical perspective, personal training, and education.\n\n\n‘Medical ethics’ is one subset of the broader disciplines of ‘healthcare ethics’ and ‘bioethics’. It overlaps with both but focuses on the duties of doctors. The original Greek and Latin expressions for ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ conveyed the same idea of a code of conduct acceptable to a particular group.\nNowadays,‘ethics’ can either mean conforming to recognized standards of practice or describe the general study of morality. Traditionally, professional ethics was what doctors defined for themselves, from their own perspective. Their duty was to work to the standards established by their peers and avoid any action that would bring the profession into disrepute. Ethics, in this sense, has always been a central concern of medicine.\nThe key difference between bioethics and medical ethics is that bioethics generally is concerned the moral principles of all biomedical technologies, such as cloning, stem cell therapy, xenotransplantation and the use of animal models in research while medical ethics is more specific and focused on everyday clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequentialism, as its name suggests, is a theory whose focus is purely on the outcome of an action. For a consequentialist, the only question to be asked when seeking a moral reason for doing something is ‘What is the result?’ The most famous form of consequentialism is utilitarianism: ‘an act is morally right if it maximizes the good’ (the terms consequentialism and utilitarianism are commonly used interchangeably).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUtilitarian Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the available means, act in such a way as to do as much good as possible\n\n\n\nThe basic principle of utilitarian ethics is do good, which is the oldest and most straightforward ethical principle. Utilitarian ethic is useful primarily in catastrophic situations. In times of war, earthquakes, or other major accidents, we have to save as many lives as possible in the shortest amount of time with very limited means. In a rational triage, one would group the wounded into those with minor wounds and injuries who can wait and those who require that we urgently stop their bleeding, clear their airways or prevent further aggravation of their health condition. Utilitarian ethics also offers appropriate advice to activities in the field of public health and preventive medicine.\nConsequentialism makes no distinction between acts and omissions. The outcome of choosing not to do something is just as significant for a consequentialist as the outcome of an act that one has chosen to perform. This means that the scope of our moral obligations may seem unfeasibly large1\nAnother counterintuitive aspect of consequentialism is its apparent imperviousness to considerations of justice. Suppose that we knew for a fact that capital punishment functions effectively as a deterrent: for each person executed, five murderers are deterred. To save resources, we might seize upon any random person, decree that they are the murderer, and execute them. Not only would this have the same deterrent effect, but it would also save police time and money since they would not need to track down the real culprit. A consequentialist would not worry about this, since the overall outcome may be deemed to outweigh the fact that one innocent person has been killed. But for many people, the injustice committed on the innocent man outweighs the beneficial consequences.\n\n\n\nCommunitarianism focuses on the fact that people have responsibilities as well as rights. It advocates policies based on consensus rather than compromise. It asserts that individuals need to concentrate not only on their own rights, but also their responsibilities to people close to them and to community. Communitarian arguments expect a concern for others to be taken into account when decisions are made. This approach comes to the fore when considering the health of communities rather than individuals. It is particularly relevant to public health ethics, genetics and any situation in which an important factor is the interrelatedness of individuals and of their interests.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘deontology’ stems from the Greek for ‘duty’. In contrast to consequentialism, a deontologist approaches ethical questions by identifying and adhering to predefined moral rules, or duties. Once we have established what our duty is, we must perform it, regardless of what the outcome may be. However, this raises the question of how we establish what our duties are.\nThe German philosopher Immanuel Kant argues that we can establish our moral duty purely through the exercise of reason without having to derive them from any theological source. This is known as ‘the categorical imperative’. To achieve this, Kant urges that in all of our decisions we should always behave in such a way that we could will for what we do to become a universal law. This means that we cannot treat our own interests as being superior to those of others. It also means that moral duties are consistent and non-arbitrary - they apply to everyone equally.\nIn utilitarian ethics, the most prominent status is given to the principle of beneficence. Kantian ethics, however, leads us to appreciate the individual, one’s free will, and rational responsibility for one’s decisions - the most important is, therefore, the ethical principle of the respect for autonomy. By requiring one to follow, without exception, universal rules, Kant excluded emotions and interpersonal relations from entering ethical reflections. Even more: an act is ethical only if the motivation comes from the general rule. If done from fear or love, the ethical value of the same act is neutral. In Kantian ethics, there is no place for compromise and no weighing of motivations for acting against the consequences, regardless of how predictable, and thus avoidable, the latter could be.\n\n\n\nIn ethical assessment, utilitarians look at the consequences of a particular act, and deontological ethicists at the conformity of the act with pre-defined rules. Virtue ethics stands in a different position: it’s foundation is the ethical characteristics of a person. Certain personal characteristics are recognized as virtues2 and others as vices. Honesty, generosity, compassion, courage, justice, fidelity, and veracity are virtues that characterize an ethical person, while deception, selfishness, cruelty, infidelity, and disingenuousness are some of the many characteristics that denote a vicious person.Virtue ethics is now regarded as being one of the three key moral theories, along with consequentialism and deontology.\nHowever, virtue ethics requires fundamentally that we have an idea of what the virtues are, and this can be difficult to establish. Certainly, Aristotle’s idea of the virtues does not necessarily harmonize with twenty-first century values. (Along with many other Greeks of his time, Aristotle thought that keeping slaves was perfectly compatible with being virtuous, and believed that women were intrinsically inferior to men.)\nVirtue ethics may be seen as an upgrading of utilitarian and deontological ethics. While virtues are in a central position, the incorporation of practical wisdom also rings consequences into virtue ethics. The rules of deontological ethics are important, yet not unbreakable. Finally, the main advantage of virtue ethics over the other two theories is that it includes human relations, and indeed gives a central position to them, a factor that has a decisive role in the practical reasoning of all of us.\n\n\n\nAnother practical approach is to use narrative or storytelling in order to give the problem context and clarify the ethical crux of it. This has been described as ‘the oldest way of exploring and expounding ethical issues’ through myth, parable or biography. It approaches problems by looking at the patient’s situation as a whole rather than considering a particular facet in isolation. It can involve an overview of the patient’s life, values and experiences of illness. Different health professionals and family members may present the picture from different angles and considering the same dilemma from such various viewpoints provides a way of ensuring that all relevant perspectives and perceptions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are influenced by ethics, the two can contradict one another in a healthcare setting. Law is based on explicit, written norms with a clear system for enacting such norms. Legal norms (approved international agreements, national constitutions, laws, and regulations) are organized hierarchically, should be mutually consistent, have a clearly defined spatial scope of their enactment, and can only apply to actions committed after the legal norm has been enacted. When an individual violates a specific legal norm, clearly defined procedures for establishing guilt and prescribed sanctions are in place.\nSometimes,legal duties as a healthcare professional can conflict with ethical responsibilities. The law may force ones do things their ethics just don’t condone. Or ones may want to do something because it’s ethical, but the law isn’t on their side."

    "text": "Existing ethical theories do not necessarily give easy answers to moral problems and, indeed, can yield counterintuitive results if pushed to their logical extremes. There is also the problem that moral values differ according to culture and context. What if the doctor is a deontologist, and the patient a consequentialist? Increasingly, in modern medicine, doctors may be treating patients who speak a different language, come from a different country, or practise a different religion. In short, patients’ values may be radically different from those of the doctor, and those of one doctor may differ from those of their colleagues.\nThe ‘four principles’ approach was developed partly in response to this problems, however the approach is not an ethical theory per se. Rather, it attempts to set out certain key considerations which are independent of social, cultural, or religious contexts. Since its inception in the twentieth century, the four principles approach has become extremely influential and is now the dominant framework for medical ethics teaching.\nThe principles in question are:\n\nAutonomy of the individual\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\nAs suggested, these principles are more properly understood as a distillation of other ethical theories, synthesized and reformatted for use in the medical setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAutonomy\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding information to patients and allowing them to make their own decisions\n\n\n\nAutonomy means self-governance: making and carrying out one’s own decisions. The importance of respect for autonomy is implicit or explicit in nearly all moral theories. With changing social expectations and, arguably, less hierarchical social and political structures, respect for autonomy has grown in importance, and is regarded by some as the cornerstone of the four principles. Autonomy is at the root of many of the fundamental requirements of good medical practice.\nThe autonomy of the individual includes the right to being informed (for there is no autonomy without information) and the right to confidentiality and privacy (otherwise other parties might influence an individual’s decisions without considering his or her will).\nThe principle of respect for autonomy is not absolute, but there is heated debate about how and when it should be overridden by other principles. What does seem clear is that it will inevitably clash with one or more of the other three principles at times. Resolving these clashes is one of the major preoccupations of medical ethicists and medical practitioners.\n\n\n\nBeneficence is the act of helping people, or benefiting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBeneficence\n\n\n\n\n\nUndertaking actions intended to benefit the patient\n\n\n\nBeneficence encapsulates what many people regard as the essence of medicine. Doctors are not here to function as servants, mechanics, shopkeepers, or teachers for their patients. Rather, their unique and special role is to help people, cure disease, relieve distress and suffering, prolong lives, and improve health. It has been argued that in this respect, doctors are radically different from other professionals.3\nAs medical technology and life-preserving interventions have proliferated, it has become evident that patients and doctors have extremely divergent views on the beneficence of life-prolonging measures. Some argue passionately for the continuance of treatment, while others argue that there are situations in which the patient cannot be benefited by being kept alive. Problems arise when a patient’s view of what is ‘beneficent’ differs from that of the doctor. We have seen that respect for autonomy is an essential component of the four principles. But a doctor may find it difficult, if not impossible, to respect the autonomy of a patient whose concept of beneficence is radically different\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is the principle of preventing or avoiding harm to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nActing so as to avoid harming the patient\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is sometimes regarded as the primary ethical principle to which doctors should adhere. It features in the Hippocratic oath, and it reappears in the common phrase ‘primum non nocere’ (from Latin: first, do no harm). The importance of this principle stems largely from the recognition that those same skills which allow a doctor to improve a patient’s health or well-being, can in themselves cause damage, pain, or sickness. Yet the injunction ‘first do no harm’ is perhaps too extreme. After all, if this really were a doctor’s first and primary obligation, they would not be able to do anything at all. It is impossible to think of any medical procedure or intervention that is entirely without risk. A simple vaccination causes harm by puncturing the skin; even screening may cause harm in the form of anxiety or a false-positive result. For this reason, it is clear that non-maleficence cannot function as medicine’s primary principle; rather, it serves as a balance against beneficence. Beneficence is an active principle - it calls for doctors to intervene to benefit their patients. Non-maleficence is a passive and cautionary principle that reminds doctors to think about the harm they may cause by intervening.\nQuestions of how to interpret “harm” also arise in the public health context. In recent years, some criticisms have been raised regarding breast screening. Frequently, screening programmes are justified on the ground that they save lives by detecting diseases which might otherwise have gone unnoticed until too late. However, in the breast screening context, it has been suggested that the screening programme causes excessive and unjustified interventions. In short, it causes harm. Some patients have biopsies only to discover there was nothing wrong. Others may have cancer detected, but in circumstances where the disease would never have become symptomatic. For example, if a very elderly patient has a very slow-growing cancer, it is highly unlikely that it will kill her. The question of whether such inadvertent harms outweigh the benefits of screening programmes is fraught. These problems, of course, also affect other moral theories that rely on concepts of harm, in particular consequentialism\n\n\n\nJustice is the principle of treating others fairly, avoiding discrimination and distributing resources equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding discrimination, distributing re- sources fairly\n\n\n\nJustice differs from the three principles already discussed. Autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence are highly patient centred. However, most moral theories recognize that the individual is not the sole ethical concern. By its very nature, ethics is a social phenomenon, meaning that questions of fairness come into play. There are two primary ways in which the principle of justice affects ethical decision-making in medicine. Firstly, there is the issue of how other people may be affected by a particular decision. Secondly, there is the question of discrimination: do some patients receive better or worse treatment than others?\nTo comply with the requirements of justice, it is important that decision - making is transparent and consistent. This can be difficult in complex healthcare systems, serving patients whose needs and values vary widely.\nThe other facet of justice is discrimination. It is often assumed that discrimination is intrinsically wrong. Yet, if we never discriminated, we would be unable to function at all. Remembering Aristotle’s injunction, ’treat equals equally and unequals unequally’, it is clear that discrimination in itself is not a problem. It would be unjust to treat a patient with a broken neck exactly the same as one with a broken finger. Where needs are different, we should treat people differently. This involves discriminating: noticing those differences and making decisions accordingly.\nDiscrimination is only a problem when it is unjust. We have suggested it is appropriate to discriminate between patients with different needs; however, if it were decided that only dark-haired patients would be treated, this would clearly be unjust, since there is no connection between hair colour and need for treatment. The challenge, therefore, is to be able to recognize what are, and what are not, the sorts of inequalities that justify treating people differently"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real ethical dilemmas are those for which every possible action (including the omission of action) brings some ethical costs to a person, or to a group of people involved. Ethical analysis begins with a list of persons involved and then explores, for each of them, the ethical benefits and costs of a certain action according to the four ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. In this way, two or more possible actions with their ethical benefits and costs are compared. Ethical analysis does not automatically lead to the recommended action; rather, it is a practical approach to analyse a dilemma, identify the problematic aspects of each of the possible actions, and alleviate the related ethical costs.\nIf an act exists that will benefit all concerned and will not offend anybody, including oneself, then ethics or ethical analysis is not needed. Ethical consideration is also not applicable to situations in which the actor has no choice. Very often, however, we do have a choice; nevertheless, each act brings some benefits and some burdens to the persons whom the act involves.\nEthical analysis is helpful in such situations. The three steps of ethical analysis are:\n\nA list of possible actions\nList of persons or groups of persons whom the actions concern\nPreparing a table with rows for each person or group of persons concerned and columns for the four ethical principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco, aged 3, was seriously hurt in a traffic accident. Upon arrival to the intensive-care unit, he is in severe hemorrhagic shock. His father, a Jehovah’s Witness, prohibits blood transfusion, even after being told that immediate blood transfusion, followed by an operation is the only possibility for survival. The physician has to decide whether he will order blood transfusion or follow the father’s demand.\n\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are blood transfusion against the father’s will or no transfusion.\nThe persons involved are Marco, his family, and the physician. In addition, we will also add to the list the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses since they might be hurt if they learn that their religious belief was ignored. This brings us to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco’s family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysician\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s\nWitnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician’s decision to apply blood transfusion against the father’s will is to be compared to the alternative option - no transfusion, which would almost certainly lead to Marco’s death. We will now insert ethical benefits, marked with a “+”, and ethical costs, marked with a “−”. Assessment of ethical benefits and costs is clearly subjective; however, subjectivity is an unavoidable characteristic of every ethical deliberation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n?\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nMarco’s family\n---\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nPhysician\n+++\n++\n++\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n–\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the ethical benefits of a transfusion against the father’s demand greatly outweigh the ethical costs. The physician in the intensive-care unit has to make decisions without delay which gives Marco a chance for survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian, aged 12, has been treated for neuroblastoma for two years. Despite intensive treatment with three lines of cytotoxic drugs, he is now in relapse. Physicians agree that there is no indication for further active treatment and recommend only supportive and palliative treatment. Due to anaemia, Damian is weak and dizzy. A blood transfusion might lead to short-term improvement of his symptoms but clearly cannot reverse the course of the disease. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, his parents refuse blood transfusion.\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are a transfusion against the parents’ will or no transfusion. The persons involved are Damian, his family, the physician, and the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Here is the table, as prepared for the decision to order blood transfusion against the will of the parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nDamian\n--\n?\n+\n?\n\n\nDamian’s family\n---\n--\n--\n---\n\n\nPhysician\n+\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n---\n---\n--\n---\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the transfusion brings very few benefits and severe ethical costs, which no lengthy explanation can reduce. As a teenager, Damian understands the religion in which he was raised. For the parents, the extremely painful experience of the imminent death of their child would be even worse due to a lack of respect from physician’s side. Their sorrow and anger might spread to the whole community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.\nIt is clear that ethical analysis involves both ethical and professional arguments and it is a strong tool against one-sided presentation of ethical dilemmas. Attention to a single dimension, most often to respect for individual autonomy, should not obscure the ethical benefits and costs for other persons whose interests are also at stake. It is clear that ethical benefits and costs are subject to individual interpretation. Ethics is not mathematics, and conclusions from an ethical analysis may be debatable, based on different professional arguments. Thus, ethical analysis does not provide a single answer, but rather a framework for balancing and reaching a rational conclusion."

    "text": "Ten medical students are learning how to perform rectal examinations. This is important for their education. However, no one likes undergoing a rectal examination unnecessarily. To ensure that students get the necessary practice, the consultant who is teaching them is trying to decide whether to allow these ten students to practise a rectal examination on 96-year-old anaesthetized woman who is undergoing surgery for an unrelated issue. The woman, who has mental capacity, has not been informed nor has she given consent. Is this ethically acceptable?\n\n\nPerforming a medical procedure on a patient who has not agreed to this may seem deceptive. Doctors are usually expected to be honest and trust-worthy and act with integrity. These are virtues that are explicitly required by the General Medical Council (GMC). Nevertheless, students may be well motivated in wanting to carry out the procedure: doing so should enable them to be better doctors in future. It seems reasonable to suppose that no one has ill intentions towards the patient in question; the procedure is not intended to harm her, and she need never know what has been done to her. However, a wise consultant may be able to exercise a more discerning judgement. Although no ill intention is involved, harm may come to the patient. Such harm, if she was not asked for her consent, will come as a shock. Though a very low-risk procedure, a rectal examination is something that carries a strong taboo in our society. The patient if she discovers she has undergone this may feel outraged or violated. We can never be entirely sure that a patient will not discover something we would prefer was kept secret. The patient’s virtues should also be considered here. If she had been asked, and had agreed to let the students examine her, this would have been a virtuous decision on her part. However, if the students examine her without her knowledge or consent, she has no opportunity to exercise virtue.\n\n\n\nFor a consequentialist, the question of whether the patient agrees to undergo the procedure is irrelevant. As long as she never finds out, no harm is done. If the action benefits ten medical students, this may be enough. Although, of course, it would be different if the procedure causes the patient harm (as it might on a 96-year-old patient), then the procedure could not be justified. However, a utilitarian must also consider the harm that might arise if the patient does find out - the patient may be distressed and angry. Patient negative experience could outweigh the benefit to the medical students. There are also broader harms and benefits to consider. If patients learn that they may be ‘practised on’ while under anaesthetic, they may lose trust in hospitals. But if no one ever finds out, perhaps overall large numbers of patients could benefit, since students will have the chance to improve their skills. If we could be 100% certain that the patient would never find out, the consequentialist would be completely happy to advise the ten students to proceed with their examination\n\n\n\nIt should immediately be apparent that a deontologist would not allow medical students to practise on an unconscious patient without her consent. This would be disregarding her autonomy, as well as being deceptive. However, would obtaining consent in advance make a difference, given that students would still be ‘using’ the patient for their own practice? Given the previous points about autonomy and consent, it seems plausible that a deontologist would be happy for the students to practise on the patient if she had consented in advance. If the patient consents, she shares in the ends of the students, that is, their desire to become better doctors, and this becomes one of her own ends.\n\n\n\nClearly, performing examinations on a patient without her consent is not in keeping with respect for autonomy. However, if this is known to be a teaching hospital, perhaps we could assume that consent to training is implied by this patient’s presence in the hospital. If so, then the procedure may not be deemed to breach the patient’s autonomy at all.\nOne might argue that the procedure is non-maleficent, and could even be beneficent if by chance it picks up something that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. It could also be argued that the broader benefits of carrying out such training in terms of improving population health could be taken to outweigh the other principles, that is, justice might decree that all patients should be willing to undergo this kind of thing for the sake of a wider population benefit.\nHowever, there are a number of issues to consider here. The first issue is whether it is reasonable to infer consent from a patient’s presence in a teaching hospital. Doctors often make this argument, but it is highly questionable. Many members of the public may not be aware of whether their nearest hospital is a teaching hospital or not. Even if they are, there is no reason to assume that they will know that this means they will be exposed to students’ examinations. Therefore, unless the patient has been explicitly consulted, it is not reasonable to suppose that she has somehow consented to being examined while under anaesthetic.\nThe arguments related to beneficence and non-maleficence likewise seem weak when probed further. It is unlikely that the examinations will cause harm; yet there is always some degree of risk and this may be exacerbated by the patient’s anger and distress if she feels she’s been abused or deceived.\nThe question about beneficence is very significant here. Some patients do not wish to know if they have a particular condition, and would choose not to attend screening programmes for this reason. The know-ledge of having a serious medical condition, though regarded as beneficial by many people, can be regarded as harmful by others. This is why people are offered screening, rather than being compelled to participate. If something sinister were identified in this woman, we do not know if she would be grateful or angry and upset about having been denied a choice.\nFinally, it is undoubtedly an admirable thing to participate in research or training. Surprisingly many patients are willing to do this when asked directly. Their choice to be involved may be described as truly altruistic. But when no choice is given, the act is not altruistic. There may also be questions to ask about why this patient in particular is being selected for this training. This is where considerations of justice can be extremely useful in identifying hidden ethical problems. What role is this patient’s age playing here? Has she been chosen as an ‘easy’ option?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n-/?\n-\n+\n---\n\n\nStudents\n+\n---\n+++\n+"

От своя страна групировката може да бъде извършена във вариационен или интервален ред.\n\nНегрупирани данни\nПри изчисление на средната аритметична за негрупирани данни се използва формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{}}{n}\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(\\sum x_{}\\) е сборът на числовите стойности на наблюдаваната променлива;\n\\({n}\\) е броят на наблюденията.\n\nНека онагледим това с пример. По-долу са представени стойностите на променливата “сърдечен пулс” за 10 студента от втори курс.\n\n\n [1] 90 80 89 72 73 74 78 86 84 82\n\n\nГрафично е представено тяхното разпределение на фигура Фигура 2. В случая, средната аритметична представлява “средата” на това разпределение (най-издадената му част). За да я изчислим разделяме сбора от стойностите на пулса за всеки един от студентите върху техния брой. Така получаваме:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{90+80+89+72+73+74+78+86+84+82}{10}\\] \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{808}{10} = 80.8\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 2: Разпределение на пулса - по хоризонтала са представени наблюдавани стойности, а по вертикала колко често са наблюдавани те в извадката. С черна пунктирана линия е представена средната аритметична. Представеното разпределение се нарича нормално - има камбановидна, симетрична форма\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГрупирани данни\n\nИнтервален ред\nКогато разполагаме с по-голям обем данни, удобно е тяхното представяне в групирана форма. При интервалния ред тази групировка се извършва чрез “разкъсване” на стойностите на изследваната променлива в равномерни и неприпокриващи се стъпки - интервали. Всеки от тях се определя от долна и горна лимитираща стойност (граница). При формирането на интервалните групи се преброяват само участниците, чиято наблюдавана стойност е в границите на интервала. С други думи, при тази групировка “губим” статистическа точност, защото не знаем индивидуалните стойностите на участниците, а само към коя група принадлежат. Пример за интервална групировка е представен в Таблица 2 .\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 2: Пример за интервален ред при измерването на пулс сред 45 студенти\n\n\n\n\n\nпулс\nброй студенти\n\n\n\n\n48 - 52\n4\n\n\n53 - 57\n5\n\n\n58 - 62\n8\n\n\n63 - 67\n11\n\n\n68 - 72\n6\n\n\n73 - 77\n6\n\n\n78 - 82\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЗа да изчислим средната стойност за променливата пулс в посочения пример, използваме формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{u}\\cdot{f}}{\\sum_f }\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(x_{u}\\) e средата на всеки от интервалите. Тя се изчислява като половината на сумата между горната и долната лимитираща стойност. Например, за интервала 48 - 52, средата е 50;\n\\(f\\) е броят на наблюденията за всеки един интервал;\n\\(x_{u}\\cdot{f}\\) е произведението между средата на интервала и броя на наблюденията в него;\n\\(\\sum{x_{u}\\cdot{f}}\\) е сумата от всички произведения;\n\\(\\sum_f\\) е сумата от всички наблюдавани участници.\n\nНека представим нагледно примера в Таблица 2 . Първата стъпка е определянето на средата на интервалите. Това е извършено в Таблица 3 .\n\n\n\nТаблица 3: Стъпка 1 - Определяне на средата на всеки интервал\n\n\n\n\n\nпулс\nсреда на интервала\nброй студенти\n\n\n\n\n48 - 52\n50\n4\n\n\n53 - 57\n55\n5\n\n\n58 - 62\n60\n8\n\n\n63 - 67\n65\n11\n\n\n68 - 72\n70\n6\n\n\n73 - 77\n75\n6\n\n\n78 - 82\n80\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСлед това изчисляваме произведенията между броя наблюдавани студенти и средата на интервала. Това е направено за всеки един интервал и представено в Таблица 4 .\n\n\n\nТаблица 4: Стъпка 2 - Умножение на средата на интервала по броя на наблюдаваните студенти в него\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nПулс\nСреда на интервала\nБрои студенти\nПроизведение \\({x_u}\\) х \\({f}\\)\n\n\n\n\n48 - 52\n50\n4\n200\n\n\n53 - 57\n55\n5\n275\n\n\n58 - 62\n60\n8\n480\n\n\n63 - 67\n65\n11\n715\n\n\n68 - 72\n70\n6\n420\n\n\n73 - 77\n75\n6\n450\n\n\n78 - 82\n80\n5\n400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nНакрая сумираме всички получени произведения и ги разделяме на броя студенти\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac {200+275+480+715+420+450+400} {45} = \\frac {2940} {45} = 65.33 \\]\n\n\n\nСтепенен ред\nВторият вариант за групиране на статистически данни е степенния ред. При него записваме всяка стойност на интересуващата ни променлива, а срещу нея нанасяме броя на наблюдаваните лица, при които сме я наблюдавали. Пример за степенен ред е представен в Таблица 5 .\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 5: Пример за степенен ред при измерването на пулс сред 17 студенти\n\n\n\n\n\nСтойност на пулса\nБрой студенти\n\n\n\n\n59\n1\n\n\n60\n0\n\n\n61\n2\n\n\n62\n4\n\n\n63\n0\n\n\n64\n3\n\n\n65\n2\n\n\n66\n1\n\n\n67\n1\n\n\n68\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЗа изчисляването на средната аритметична, при данни в степенен ред, използваме формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{}\\cdot{f}}{\\sum_f }\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(x_{}\\) e стойността на наблюдаваната променлива;\n\\(f\\) е броят на наблюденията за всяка една стойност;\n\\(x_{}\\cdot{f}\\) е произведението между всяка от стойностите на променливата и броя на наблюденията за нея;\n\\(\\sum{x_{}\\cdot{f}}\\) е сумата от всички произведения;\n\\(\\sum{f}\\) е сумата от всички наблюдавани участници.\n\nНека представим нагледно примера в Таблица 5 . Първата стъпка, за изчисление на средната аритметична, е определянето на произведенията между всяка една стойност на променливата и съответния брой на наблюденията.

При построяването на графика - разпределението е камбановидно и симетрично.*\nАко сме изчислили теглото на извадка от 1000 души и сме установили че \\({\\bar{x}} = {80\\pm 10}\\) и приемем променливата за нормално разпределена можем да твърдим, че 95 % от участниците (950 изследвани) имат тегло в диапазона \\(80\\pm 2\\cdot{SD}= 80\\pm 20\\) или от 60 до 120 кг. Останалите 2,5 % от останалите 50 участници (25) ще имат тегло над 110 кг, а 25 души (2,5 %) ще имат тегло под 60 кг.*\n\n\n\n\nИлюстративно нормалното разпределение е представено на фигура Фигура 3 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 3: Нормално разпределение"

Въпреки това, ако изчислим средната аритметична за цялата група получаваме 5.91 дни. Това число не представя добре централната тенденция, тъй като само 3 от 24-те (12.5%) пациенти са пролежали в болница за повече от 6 дни. Техните стойности се наричат екстремални, а средната аритметична силно повлияна от тях.\nАко нанесем броя на дните по хоризонтала, а броя на пациентите по вертикала ще получим разпределението на променливата “продължителност на хоспитализацията” – тя е представена на Фигура 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 4: В този случай, средната аритметична (непрекъснатата линия) е изместена към екстремалните стойности. По-добър показател е медианата - тя е 4 дни (прекъснатата линия) и по-добре представя централната тенденция в данните.\n\n\n\n\n\nПредставеното в Фигура 4 разпределение дясно изтеглено. С други думи, по-голямата част от наблюденията се намират в лявата част на средната аритметична, а екстремалните 5-ма пациенти издърпват “опашката” на разпределението на дясно. В случаи като тези, медианата е по-добър показател за централна тенденция.\nЗа да разберем какво е разсейването спрямо медианата използваме показателя интерквартилен размах. Подобно на стандартното отклонение, той онагледява разсейването на наблюденията спрямо медианата.

В случая 6-тият пациент, пролежал 2 дни, е на границата между първата и останалите три четвъртини на статистическия ред. Стойността, на неговото пролежаване представлява 1-вия квартил \\({Q1}\\). Стойността на пролежаването на 12-тия пациент (4 дни) ограничава разделя статистически ред на две равни части, това е и медианата или втория квартил \\({Q2}\\) - половината пациенти са пролежали повече дни от него. Стойността на пролежаването на 18-тия пациент (6 дни) е 4-тия квартил \\({Q3}\\).\nСлед като сме определили квартилите прилагаме формулата. Интерквартилният размах е\n\\[{IQR} = {Q3} - {Q1} = 6 - 2 = 4\\]\nЗа графично представяне на интерквартилния размах използваме боксплот диаграмата представена на Фигура 5 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 5: Боксплотът се описва като кутия с мустаци. Лявата страна на кутията представя първия, а дясната страна третия квартил. В средата на кутията с черна линия хоризонтална линия е представена медианата.\n\n\n\n\n\nС помощта на интерквартилния размах можем да определим кои стойности са “екстремални” 11"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Definition: Risk factor refers to characteristics or conditions that increase the likelihood of an individual or population developing a specific disease, injury, or adverse health outcome. A risk factor is an element associated with increased risk.\nBasic definitions:\n\nRisk - The likelihood of an adverse event or disease occurrence.\nOdds - The probability of an event happening (p) divided by the probability of the event not happening (q).\n\nClassification - Risk factors can be classified in several ways:\n\nModifiable and Non-modifiable: Modifiable risk factors are those that can be changed or managed, such as smoking, diet, or physical activity. Non-modifiable risk factors are those that cannot be changed, such as genetic characteristics.\nBehavioral and Environmental Factors: Behavioral risk factors are related to individual choices and actions, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Environmental risk factors are associated with the surrounding environment of the individual, such as exposure to pollution, infectious agents, or workplace hazards.\nBiological and Social: Biological risk factors are linked to an individual’s physiology and genetics, such as hormonal imbalances or inherited traits. Social risk factors are related to the social and economic environment of the individual, such as poverty, social isolation, or lack of access to healthcare.\nProximal and Distal: Proximal risk factors are those that directly contribute to the development of a particular disease or condition, such as high blood pressure or elevated blood glucose levels. Distal risk factors are those that indirectly contribute to the development of a disease or condition, such as socio-economic status or level of education.\nPrimary and Secondary: Primary risk factors are those directly associated with the development of a specific disease or condition, such as smoking and lung cancer. Secondary risk factors are those that increase the risk of developing a disease or condition indirectly, such as obesity and its association with diabetes and heart diseases.\n\nExposure: The moment of contact between an individual and the risk factor. It includes the strength of the factor (power of exposure) and the duration of contact. Typically in epidemiology, individuals who have had contact with the risk factor are called exposed, while those without contact are termed unexposed.\nRisk Group: A group of the population with an increased risk of disease, sharing common risk factors.\n\nLow-risk groups: Not exposed to the influence of any known risk factor.\nModerate-risk groups: Exposed to moderate effects of one or several risk factors.\nHigh-risk groups: Exposed to multiple risk factors over an extended period.\nVery high-risk groups: Groups with known inherited risk factors - genetic predisposition.\n\nLeading Risk Factors\n\nBehavioral Risk Factors:\n\nSmoking\nHigh alcohol consumption\nLow physical activity\nUnhealthy diet\n\nSecondary Risk Factors:\n\nArterial hypertension\nOverweight\nHypercholesterolemia\nHyperglycemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: The concept of “causality” is fundamental to applied epidemiology. In its definition, epidemiology attempts to uncover the “causes” of diseases. In the broadest sense, a “cause” is understood as an event or phenomenon that leads to a subsequent event or phenomenon called a result. Determining the “cause” of diseases is crucial for social medicine because:\n\nIt allows for the introduction of health actions preventing contact with risk factors for disease in healthy individuals (primary prevention).\nIt clarifies the mechanism of interaction between risk factors and the body and establishes the natural course of the disease.\nIt introduces specific activities for early detection of the diseased (secondary prevention).\nIt provides opportunities for in-depth research on diseases, discovery, and implementation of specific therapy and rehabilitation (tertiary prevention).\n\nTypes of Epidemiological Relationships: The concept of causality in epidemiology is quite complex. Two types of relationships are possible:\n\nDirect - an association (correlation) between the factor and the result, with or without a true cause-effect relationship between them. When two phenomena are related but there is no cause-effect relationship, we refer to it as “parallelism.”\nIndirect - it is also possible for “third” or more factors to “blur” the true cause-effect relationship between phenomena or to modify (increase or decrease) the manifestation thereof.\n\nMechanisms: From the perspective of causality theory, a factor can cause a disease through the following mechanisms:\n\nThe factor is necessary and sufficient. An example of such interaction is monogenic diseases. In this group of diseases, the factor represents a genetic structural anomaly that leads to a phenotypic change.\nThe factor is necessary but not sufficient. Many infectious diseases, for example, require additional factors besides the infectious agent. Tuberculosis bacteria are necessary for the manifestation of acute miliary tuberculosis, but they are not sufficient to cause it alone. Here, the interaction of the infectious agent with other factors in the body and the environment, which modify its effect (modifiers), is primarily important.\nThe factor is not necessary but sufficient. An example of such interaction is some oncological diseases. Smoking is a proven risk factor of lung cancer. Independently, it is sufficient for this disease. However, smoking is not “necessary” as an obligatory element for the onset of the disease. Other factors alone or in interaction with each other can cause the same disease in non-smokers.\nThe factor is neither necessary nor sufficient. These are factors that have been mistakenly considered “etiological” or “risk” factors for the onset of the disease. However, it is established that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause it.\n\nTypes of Interactions between Factor (Cause) and Result: Despite the various types of interactions between different factors in the genesis of the disease, from an epidemiological point of view, three types of interfactor interactions can be presented schematically and simplified.\n\nChain Interaction: Mediator/Modifier Type: In this form of interaction, a single risk factor alone is potent enough to incite a particular ailment. However, the involvement of a third factor, often termed a “mediator,” intercedes in the connection between the risk factor and the disease manifestation. For instance, the relationship between smoking and cerebrovascular disease - while smoking can directly lead to cerebrovascular issues, it can also induce arterial hypertension, which subsequently increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, within this model, there’s discussion about modifying interactions, where an additional factor alters the impact of the risk factor, either attenuating or amplifying it. Such alterations may exhibit:\nMultiplicative effects (significantly stronger when combined).\nAdditive effects (the combined influence of the modifier and the risk factor).\n\nDivergent Interaction: Confounding Factor Type: This scenario involves a factor that acts as a common underlying cause for both the risk factor and the disease outcome. In clinical epidemiology, common confounding factors include gender and age. Despite being often categorized as “risk” factors, gender and age should more accurately be labeled as “prognostic”, rather than direct causes of diseases. For example, when exploring the link between coffee consumption and myocardial infarction, while coffee intake might be perceived as a direct risk factor, upon separate examination within smoker and non-smoker groups, the link disappear. Here, coffee consumption acts as a confounding factor, while the actual cause-effect relationship lies between smoking and heart attacks. The process of segregating individuals based on such factors is known as “stratification.”\nCumulative Interaction (Collier): This type involves a factor that emerges as a shared outcome of both the risk factor and the disease itself. For instance, a study conducted by Sackett in 1979, where an analysis of hospitalized patients found a correlation between locomotor deficits and infectious lung diseases. Initially appearing as a plausible association, later scrutiny in a sample of non-hospitalized individuals failed to establish such a relationship. This discrepancy underscores the nuanced nature of disease interactions, wherein seemingly related conditions might, upon closer examination, reveal independent pathways to the same outcome, such as hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Bradford-Hill endeavors to introduce criteria that should be met to determine a causal relationship between two factors. His work remains foundational in epidemiology and causality theory.\nCriteria:\n\nStrength of Association: The stronger the statistical association between phenomena, the more likely the relationship between them is causal.\nConsistency (Reproducibility): The findings should be reproducible by other researchers, at different times, in different places, and using different methods, with explanations for any discrepancies.\nSpecificity of Association: The more precisely the disease and exposure to the presumed risk factor can be defined, the stronger the observed association.\nTemporal Relationship: The presumed cause must always precede the effect in time. This is the only obligatory criterion.\nBiological Gradient: Changes in the intensity of exposure to the presumed risk factor lead to corresponding changes in the level of disease occurrence.\nPlausibility: The association must have a logical explanation in line with general medical knowledge and science.\nCoherence: All observations and results should be consistent with the hypothetical model.\nExperimental Evidence: In experimental conditions, changes in the cause should lead to changes in the outcome.\nAnalogy: The association should resemble similar described phenomena and events.\n\nMandatory Criterion: Temporal relationship"

    "text": "Definition: The concept of “causality” is fundamental to applied epidemiology. In its definition, epidemiology attempts to uncover the “causes” of diseases. In the broadest sense, a “cause” is understood as an event or phenomenon that leads to a subsequent event or phenomenon called a result. Determining the “cause” of diseases is crucial for social medicine because:\n\nIt allows for the introduction of health actions preventing contact with risk factors for disease in healthy individuals (primary prevention).\nIt clarifies the mechanism of interaction between risk factors and the body and establishes the natural course of the disease.\nIt introduces specific activities for early detection of the diseased (secondary prevention).\nIt provides opportunities for in-depth research on diseases, discovery, and implementation of specific therapy and rehabilitation (tertiary prevention).\n\nTypes of Epidemiological Relationships: The concept of causality in epidemiology is quite complex. Two types of relationships are possible:\n\nDirect - an association (correlation) between the factor and the result, with or without a true cause-effect relationship between them. When two phenomena are related but there is no cause-effect relationship, we refer to it as “parallelism.”\nIndirect - it is also possible for “third” or more factors to “blur” the true cause-effect relationship between phenomena or to modify (increase or decrease) the manifestation thereof.\n\nMechanisms: From the perspective of causality theory, a factor can cause a disease through the following mechanisms:\n\nThe factor is necessary and sufficient. An example of such interaction is monogenic diseases. In this group of diseases, the factor represents a genetic structural anomaly that leads to a phenotypic change.\nThe factor is necessary but not sufficient. Many infectious diseases, for example, require additional factors besides the infectious agent. Tuberculosis bacteria are necessary for the manifestation of acute miliary tuberculosis, but they are not sufficient to cause it alone. Here, the interaction of the infectious agent with other factors in the body and the environment, which modify its effect (modifiers), is primarily important.\nThe factor is not necessary but sufficient. An example of such interaction is some oncological diseases. Smoking is a proven risk factor of lung cancer. Independently, it is sufficient for this disease. However, smoking is not “necessary” as an obligatory element for the onset of the disease. Other factors alone or in interaction with each other can cause the same disease in non-smokers.\nThe factor is neither necessary nor sufficient. These are factors that have been mistakenly considered “etiological” or “risk” factors for the onset of the disease. However, it is established that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause it.\n\nTypes of Interactions between Factor (Cause) and Result: Despite the various types of interactions between different factors in the genesis of the disease, from an epidemiological point of view, three types of interfactor interactions can be presented schematically and simplified.\n\nChain Interaction: Mediator/Modifier Type: In this form of interaction, a single risk factor alone is potent enough to incite a particular ailment. However, the involvement of a third factor, often termed a “mediator,” intercedes in the connection between the risk factor and the disease manifestation. For instance, the relationship between smoking and cerebrovascular disease - while smoking can directly lead to cerebrovascular issues, it can also induce arterial hypertension, which subsequently increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, within this model, there’s discussion about modifying interactions, where an additional factor alters the impact of the risk factor, either attenuating or amplifying it. Such alterations may exhibit:\nMultiplicative effects (significantly stronger when combined).\nAdditive effects (the combined influence of the modifier and the risk factor).\n\nDivergent Interaction: Confounding Factor Type: This scenario involves a factor that acts as a common underlying cause for both the risk factor and the disease outcome. In clinical epidemiology, common confounding factors include gender and age. Despite being often categorized as “risk” factors, gender and age should more accurately be labeled as “prognostic”, rather than direct causes of diseases. For example, when exploring the link between coffee consumption and myocardial infarction, while coffee intake might be perceived as a direct risk factor, upon separate examination within smoker and non-smoker groups, the link disappear. Here, coffee consumption acts as a confounding factor, while the actual cause-effect relationship lies between smoking and heart attacks. The process of segregating individuals based on such factors is known as “stratification.”\nCumulative Interaction (Collier): This type involves a factor that emerges as a shared outcome of both the risk factor and the disease itself. For instance, a study conducted by Sackett in 1979, where an analysis of hospitalized patients found a correlation between locomotor deficits and infectious lung diseases. Initially appearing as a plausible association, later scrutiny in a sample of non-hospitalized individuals failed to establish such a relationship. This discrepancy underscores the nuanced nature of disease interactions, wherein seemingly related conditions might, upon closer examination, reveal independent pathways to the same outcome, such as hospitalization."

    "text": "Definition: Bradford-Hill endeavors to introduce criteria that should be met to determine a causal relationship between two factors. His work remains foundational in epidemiology and causality theory.\nCriteria:\n\nStrength of Association: The stronger the statistical association between phenomena, the more likely the relationship between them is causal.\nConsistency (Reproducibility): The findings should be reproducible by other researchers, at different times, in different places, and using different methods, with explanations for any discrepancies.\nSpecificity of Association: The more precisely the disease and exposure to the presumed risk factor can be defined, the stronger the observed association.\nTemporal Relationship: The presumed cause must always precede the effect in time. This is the only obligatory criterion.\nBiological Gradient: Changes in the intensity of exposure to the presumed risk factor lead to corresponding changes in the level of disease occurrence.\nPlausibility: The association must have a logical explanation in line with general medical knowledge and science.\nCoherence: All observations and results should be consistent with the hypothetical model.\nExperimental Evidence: In experimental conditions, changes in the cause should lead to changes in the outcome.\nAnalogy: The association should resemble similar described phenomena and events.\n\nMandatory Criterion: Temporal relationship"

Пациентите лекувани с бета блокер се характеризират с среден пулс от 65 уд/мин и стандартно отклонение от 4,08 уд/мин, докато при пациентите приемащи плацебо средният пулс е близо 82 уд/мин, а стандартното отклонение 8.16 уд/мин. Наблюдаваната разликата между средните величини в двете групи е почти 17 уд/мин.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 1: В групата с бета блокер (тъмно сиво) средният пулс е 65 уд/мин (непрекъсната линия), докато в контролната група (светлосиво) пулсът е 81 уд/мин (прекъсната линия). Добиваме и представа и за хомогеността.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Doctors owe special duties of care to their patients;\nAll interactions involving doctors and patients should be characterised by honesty, politeness and respect on both sides;\nEffective communication requires both parties to listen, talk frankly and recognize uncertainties;\nDoctors have the main duty to make the relationship work but patients also have responsibilities;\nEstablishing and maintaining appropriate boundaries is essential.\n\n\n\nDiscussion of the ‘doctor–patient partnership’ has the therapeutic model in mind, whether it takes place in a primary care or hospital setting. The doctor has a commitment to the patient although other professionals may manage specific episodes of care. What distinguishes this from other models of care is that the doctor focuses on the best interests of the patient, even though the patient’s wishes may have to be overridden in exceptional cases if they conflict seriously with other duties of the doctor, such as the need to use evidence-based therapies, manage hospital resources carefully or avoid putting other people’s health at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician-patient relationship has long been regarded as asymmetric. The physician was supposed to have knowledge about the patient’s condition, whereas the patient was seen as someone who lacked insight in his own situation. The physician was considered to be rational, the patient emotional. In the last decades the situation changed fundamentally. Patient autonomy and right to take decision is now emphasized. Physicians are less inclined to think they know what is best for the patient.\nThomas Percival’s 1803 influential text on medical ethics set the benchmark for the traits of a good doctor which, he said, should be a balance of compassion and authority. He advised that doctors should be sensitive to patients’ fears and anxieties by shielding them from disturbing information. Generations of doctors were taught to keep up patients’ hopes and spirits by withholding bad news which would depress them. The duty of beneficence was interpreted as an obligation to be reassuring rather than honest. From the 1950s, this interpretation became discredited and, by the 1980s, paternalism was seen as completely outmoded. All current ethical guidance sees patients themselves as the most suitable arbiters of their own best interests. This entails them being given all the relevant information about their condition.\nChanging expectations of the doctors’ role led some to be concerned that they would be seen as mere technicians rather than real partners in relationships with patients. Terms such as ‘cafeteria medicine’ describe situations in which doctors are perceived as simply offering patients a menu of choices in a mechanistic approach to patient autonomy. Although there must be a presumption that patients are informed about decisions in relation to their treatment, the fear of being seen as paternalistic or disrespectful of patient autonomy should no mean that doctors automatically apply the same checklist in all cases.\n\n\n\nModels of the Doctor–Patient Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of paternalism originated in the 1880s, with its fundamental idea being the “principle and practice of paternal administration, government by a father.” Drawing an analogy with a father, paternalism assumes two aspects of the paternal role: the father acting benevolently in line with his understanding of his children’s interests and making decisions about their well-being instead of letting them decide. In healthcare relationships, this analogy extends further, asserting that professionals, with their superior training and knowledge, hold an authoritative position to determine the patient’s best interests. Hence, the central principle in this model is beneficence.\nPaternalism always entails some form of interference or refusal to comply with an individual’s preferences regarding their well-being. Paternalistic actions often involve force, coercion, deception, lying, manipulation of information, or withholding information. Various forms of paternalism exist:\n\nStrong paternalism implies that the patient is competent to give consent, but the doctor does not afford them the opportunity, withholding sufficient information.\nWeak paternalism indicates that the patient is unable to comprehend the provided information due to factors like youth, mental illness, or incapacity.\n\nContemporary ethics generally rejects strong paternalism, except in rare instances like mandatory treatment for certain infectious diseases with quarantine measures or obligatory tests in specific professions. Antipaternalists argue that strong paternalistic intervention cannot be justified as it violates individual rights and excessively restricts free choice. On the other hand, weak paternalism finds justification in emergency situations or when the patient cannot make decisions due to pain, stress, unconsciousness, or shock. It is deemed acceptable for young children, very old patients, and mentally ill patients, especially in emergency situations where there’s no time for surrogate decision-making. In these cases, the prevention of harm or the provision of benefits usually outweighs the loss of independence, given the person’s limited ability to make autonomous choices.\nThere are also distinctions between active and passive paternalism.\n\nActive paternalism occurs when a patient prefers non-intervention\nPassive paternalism involves a professional’s refusal to carry out a patient’s positive preferences for paternalistic reasons.\n\nPassive paternalism is generally more justifiable than active paternalism, as physicians are not morally obligated to satisfy a patient’s desires if they conflict with accepted medical standards or the physician’s conscience.\n\n\n\nThe model is sometimes referred to as the scientific engineering or consumer model. In this approach, the goal of the interaction between the physician and patient is for the physician to furnish the patient with all pertinent information. The patient, in turn, selects the medical interventions they desire, which is carried out the by the doctor. In this context, the physician educates the patient about their disease state, potential diagnostic and therapeutic options, the risks and benefits associated with these interventions, and any uncertainties in knowledge.\nThe informative model presupposes a distinct separation between facts and values. The patient’s values are assumed to be well-defined and known; what the patient lacks is factual information. The physician’s duty is to provide all available facts, with the patient’s values determining the course of treatment. There is no room for the physician’s values, or judgment. In the informative model, the physician functions as a conveyor of technical expertise, offering the patient the means to exert control. The concept of patient autonomy in this model revolves around the patient’s control over medical decision-making.\nIn its most extremes form of this model, physicians are viewed as the services or commodities they provide—essentially, mere products. Consequently, the doctor-patient relationship in this model is highly asymmetrical, differing significantly from the partnership model and, in some aspects, can be seen as the complete opposite of the paternalist model. Analee and Thomas Beisecker succinctly encapsulate the consumer metaphor in the doctor-patient relationship with the following points: “Consumerism focuses on rights; consumerism assumes the doctor is self-centered; consumerism replaces trust with accountability; consumerism presumes that the patient’s health care values dominate; consumerism may require third-party supervision.” The underlying assumption of the consumer model is that the interests of the physician and the patient diverge, and the sole person genuinely concerned about the patient’s health is the patient. Crucially, in this context, the specific distribution of power lies in the hands of the patient: “In a consumerist relationship, the seller has no particular authority; power rests in the buyer who can make the decisions to buy or not to buy as he or she sees fit.”\n\n\n\nThis model closely follows the informative model but provides a greater role for the doctor to assist the patient in understanding her values and interests, and the possible impact of different interventions in these terms. The doctor acts as an advisor to help the patient “elucidate and make coherent” their values but does not pass judgement on these values or attempt to prioritize them on behalf of the patient. The ultimate choice of intervention still rests with the patient in the interpretive model, but the doctor plays a more active role in shaping this choice. Similar to the informative physician, the interpretive physician imparts information about the nature of the condition and the potential risks and benefits of interventions. However, the interpretive physician goes beyond this by helping the patient articulate and comprehend their values, aiding in determining which medical interventions best reflect those values.\nIn the interpretive model, the patient’s values are not necessarily fixed and may not be fully understood by the patient. They might be unclear, in flux, or conflicting in specific situations. In extreme cases, the physician may view the patient’s life as a narrative whole, specifying the patient’s values and their priority, and then identifying tests and treatments that align with these values. Importantly, the physician does not dictate to the patient.\n\n\n\nIn the deliberative model, the goal of the physician-patient interaction is to assist the patient in determining and selecting the most appropriate health-related values that can be actualized in the clinical context. The physician accomplishes this by providing information about the patient’s clinical situation and helping to clarify the types of values inherent in the available options. The physician’s objectives extend to suggesting why certain health-related values are more commendable and should be pursued.\nThis model closely follows the interpretive model but gives the doctor a greater role in judging and prioritizing patient values.** It is the doctor’s role to “elucidate the types of values embodied in the available options, suggesting why certain health-related values are more worthy and should be aspired to.”. The aim of the deliberation is moral persuasion, but not coercion, with the patient ultimately deciding on the appropriate validity and priority of these values in their life. Whereas the doctor is an advisor or counsellor in the interpretive model, in the deliberative model they serve as “a teacher or friend, engaging the patient in dialogue on what course of action would be best.” The doctor indicates both what the patient could do and, in the context of their understanding of the patient’s life and values, what he thinks the patient should do in terms of choice of intervention. The final decision still remains with the patient but is subject to greater persuasion and normative argumentation on the part of the doctor. This model conceives of patient autonomy as a tool for moral self-development; “the patient is empowered not simply to follow unexamined preferences or examined values, but to consider, through dialogue, alternative health-related values, their worthiness, and their implications for treatment.”\n\n\n\n\nIt is never easy to deliver or receive bad news, particularly when no cure is available and there is little that the patient or health team can do to alter the situation. The doctor’s role is to ensure that decision making is returned as much as possible to the patient, rather than pre-empting the choice. Although in the past, doctors often fudged the issue because they feared that the truth might result in lost hopes, sadness, suffering and grief, patients now expect honest answers and support for the anxieties that may flow from them. They should be supported in dealing with the additional anxiety sometimes created by greater knowledge. They have their own goals and need as accurate information as possible about what is achievable. The clinical limitations need to be discussed but doctors also need to be open about any other factors that are likely to affect treatment decisions or their timing.\n\n\n\n\nOne defines bad news as “any news that drastically and negatively alters the patient’s view of her or his future”. Bad news is stereotypically associated with a terminal diagnosis, but family physicians encounter many situations that involve imparting bad news; for example, a pregnant woman’s ultrasound verifies a fetal demise, a middle-aged woman’s magnetic resonance imaging scan confirms the clinical suspicion of multiple sclerosis, or an adolescent’s polydipsia and weight loss prove to be the onset of diabetes.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why physicians have difficulty breaking bad news. A common concern is how the news will affect the patient, and this is often used to justify withholding bad news. Hippocrates advised “concealing most things from the patient while you are attending to him. Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and serenity…revealing nothing of the patient’s future or present condition. For many patients…have taken a turn for the worse…by forecast of what is to come.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Advance preparation\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the relevant clinical information. Ideally, have the patient’s chart or pertinent laboratory data on hand during the conversation.\nBe prepared to provide at least basic information about prognosis and treatment options.\nArrange for adequate time in a private, comfortable location. Instruct office or hospital staff that there should be no interruptions. Turn your pager to silent mode or leave it with a colleague.\nMentally rehearse how you will deliver the news. You may wish to practice out loud, as you would prepare for public speaking. Script specific words and phrases to use or avoid.\nIf you have limited experience delivering bad news, consider observing a more experienced colleague or role play a variety of scenarios with colleagues before actually being faced with the situation. Prepare emotionally.\n\n\nB Build a therapeutic environment/relationship\n\n\nDetermine the patient’s preferences for what and how much they want to know.\nWhen possible, have family members or other supportive persons present. This should be at the patient’s discretion. If bad news is anticipated, ask in advance who they would like present and how they would like the others to be involved.\nIntroduce yourself to everyone present and ask for names and relationships to the patient. Foreshadow the bad news, “I’m sorry, but I have bad news.”\nUse touch where appropriate. Some patients or family members will prefer not to be touched. Be sensitive to cultural differences and personal preference.\nAvoid inappropriate humor or flippant comments; depending on your relationship with the patient, some discreet humor may be appropriate. Assure the patient you will be available.\nSchedule follow-up meetings and make appropriate arrangements with your office. Advise appropriate staff and colleagues of the situation.\n\n\nC Communicate well\n\n\nAsk what the patient or family already knows and understands. One source advises, “Before you tell, ask…. Find out the patient’s expectations before you give the information.” Speak frankly but compassionately.\nAvoid euphemisms and medical jargon. Use the words cancer or death.\nAllow silence and tears, and avoid the urge to talk to overcome your own discomfort. Proceed at the patient’s pace. Have the patient tell you his or her understanding of what you have said. Encourage questions.\nAt subsequent visits, ask the patient if he or she understands, and use repetition and corrections as needed. Be aware that the patient will not retain much of what is said after the initial bad news.\nWrite things down, use sketches or diagrams, and repeat key information. At the conclusion of each visit, summarize and make follow-up plans.\n\n\nD Deal with the patient and family reactions\n\n\nAssess and respond to emotional reactions.\nBe aware of cognitive coping strategies (e.g., denial, blame, intellectualization, disbelief, acceptance).\nBe attuned to body language.\nWith subsequent visits, monitor the patient’s emotional status, assessing for despondency or suicidal ideations.\nBe empathetic; it is appropriate to say “I’m sorry” or “I don’t know.” Crying may be appropriate, but be reflective—are your tears from empathy with your patient or are they a reflection of your own personal issues?\nDo not argue with or criticize colleagues; avoid defensiveness regarding your, or a colleague’s, medical care.\n\n\nE Encourage and validate emotions\n\n\nOffer realistic hope. Even if a cure is not realistic, offer hope and encouragement about what options are available. Discuss treatment options at the outset, and arrange follow-up meetings for decision making.\nExplore what the news means to the patient. Inquire about the patient’s emotional and spiritual needs and what support systems they have in place.\nOffer referrals as needed. Use interdisciplinary services to enhance patient care (e.g., hospice), but avoid using these as a means of disengaging from the relationship.\nAttend to your own needs during and following the delivery of bad news. Issues of counter-transference may arise, triggering poorly understood but powerful feelings. A formal or informal debriefing session with involved house staff, office or hospital personnel may be appropriate to review the medical management and their feelings.\n\n\n\n\nThe acronym SPIKES, stands for Setting up, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Emotions with Empathy, and Strategy or Summary. This approach was designed by Walter Baile and colleagues at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston TX, and is designed to help healthcare professionals to accomplish the following while breaking bad news:\n\nSetting Up\n\nThe first step of the SPIKES protocol is setting up the interview. Setting the stage for optimal communication by preparing what to say prior to the conversation is essential to successful communication. In this steps setting the room environment where the discussion will take place also is important.\n\nPerception\n\nThe patient’s perception of the news to be shared will determine how the news is conveyed to the patient. Empathic communication skills will help the doctor explore the patient and family’s perception of illness or events to date in a disease trajectory. The patient’s response to the doctor’s questioning will help guide the manner and detail by which the details will be conveyed. Additionally, the physician can interpret if the patient is engaging in any variation of illness denial such as wishful thinking, omission of the essential but unfavorable medical details of the illness, or unrealistic expectations of treatment.\n\nInvitation\n\nThe permission to have information shared is granted by the patient or family. Once an inquiry has been made as to the extent of understanding and the context in which the information fits, the doctor can then ask for permission to share the current news. Using what the patient has shared about their understanding of the illness and the context in which testing has been done, the doctor then asks permission to share the current information.\n\nKnowledge\n\nTo “Fire a Warning Shot” and warn the patient and family that the incoming news is not good. Beginning a discussion with phrases such as: “Unfortunately I have some bad news to tell you,” or “I am sorry to tell you,” or “Things are not going in the direction we had hoped” allows the patient and family to emotionally brace themselves for the information to follow. These statements of warning also establish the doctor as a patient advocate.\nThe sharing of bad news must be presented based on the assessed level of patient’s understanding, compliance, and wishes for disclosure. Instead of using technical language, showing patients concrete examples of trends in lab work or radiology can make an abstract concept clearer. The actual sharing of the bad news should be done slowly so that the patient and family understand. Choosing words carefully is particularly important if the news indicates a very poor prognosis. In situations involving cancer, patients report that the most important component of the process of breaking bad news is the content itself, specifically the expertise and the specific detail that is provided during the conversation. This demands that the doctor be well prepared for the informational needs of the patient and family.\n\nEmpathy\n\nPatients will have a wide range of emotional reactions as they respond to the bad news delivered to them. The emotional response may range from silence to dramatic crying and sobbing. This creates a potentially awkward situation for the doctor, but this sense of awkwardness can be diminished through engaging in empathetic communication. Although the entire conversation and time spent interacting with the patient involves empathetic communication, an appropriate and kind response to the emotion demonstrated when the patient hears bad news is critically important. The doctor should show an understanding of the patient’s emotion and demonstrate empathy and respect in the face of a difficult situation.\n\nStrategizing for the future\n\nThe last step in the SPIKES Protocol, will be to establish that patients have a clear plan for the future. Preparatory information is important in order to decrease distress, regardless of illness stage. One of the best ways to prepare a patient for participation in treatment decisions is to ensure that he or she understands the information that has been provided. Before discussing a treatment plan, it is important to ask your patient if they are ready for such a discussion. Frequent clarification during the discussion of the treatment plan will help the doctor establish the patient’s understanding and likelihood of following through with the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall gifts from patients of nominal or modest value are acceptable on the part of the physician. This is provided that there is no expectation of a different form of therapy or a higher level of care based on the gift. You can accept a cake at Christmas, a balloon on your birthday, or other tokens of esteem, but not if the patient expects an extra, or different prescription for something, in exchange for the gift. The rules on gifts from patients are far less rigorous, precise, or clear than the rules on gifts from the pharmaceutical industry. There is an automatic presumption that gifts from industry always carry an influence toward a product, service, or prescribing practice. Gifts from industry are viewed differently because there can be no other intention behind them except to buy influence and alter behavior. There is no such automatic presumption on the part of gifts received from patients.\n\n\n\nSexual contact between a physician and a patient is always inappropriate. It is unclear if there can ever be a completely acceptable, ethical way to alter the physician/patient relationship so that sexual contact is acceptable. At the very least, the physician and patient must mutually agree to end the formal professional relationship of a doctor and a patient. It is not clear how much time must elapse between the ending of the professional doctor/ patient relationship and the beginning of a personal relationship. The recommendation for psychiatrists is somewhat unique. The American Psychiatric Association guidelines specifically state that there can never be a sexual or personally intimate private relationship between doctor and patient even after the professional relationship has ended. In other words, a psychiatrist should not have sexual contact even with former patients. These guidelines apply no matter who initiates the relationship. In other words, it is not more acceptable for a doctor and patient to have sexual relations if the patient initiates the sexual relationship rather than the physician. These guidelines also take no account of gender or sexual orientation. It is always ethically unacceptable to have a sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and either a current or a former patient. It is ethically unacceptable for a physician of any kind to have a sexual relationship with a current patient."

The doctor has a commitment to the patient although other professionals may manage specific episodes of care. What distinguishes this from other models of care is that the doctor focuses on the best interests of the patient, even though the patient’s wishes may have to be overridden in exceptional cases if they conflict seriously with other duties of the doctor, such as the need to use evidence-based therapies, manage hospital resources carefully or avoid putting other people’s health at risk."

    "text": "The physician-patient relationship has long been regarded as asymmetric. The physician was supposed to have knowledge about the patient’s condition, whereas the patient was seen as someone who lacked insight in his own situation. The physician was considered to be rational, the patient emotional. In the last decades the situation changed fundamentally. Patient autonomy and right to take decision is now emphasized. Physicians are less inclined to think they know what is best for the patient.\nThomas Percival’s 1803 influential text on medical ethics set the benchmark for the traits of a good doctor which, he said, should be a balance of compassion and authority. He advised that doctors should be sensitive to patients’ fears and anxieties by shielding them from disturbing information. Generations of doctors were taught to keep up patients’ hopes and spirits by withholding bad news which would depress them. The duty of beneficence was interpreted as an obligation to be reassuring rather than honest. From the 1950s, this interpretation became discredited and, by the 1980s, paternalism was seen as completely outmoded. All current ethical guidance sees patients themselves as the most suitable arbiters of their own best interests. This entails them being given all the relevant information about their condition.\nChanging expectations of the doctors’ role led some to be concerned that they would be seen as mere technicians rather than real partners in relationships with patients. Terms such as ‘cafeteria medicine’ describe situations in which doctors are perceived as simply offering patients a menu of choices in a mechanistic approach to patient autonomy. Although there must be a presumption that patients are informed about decisions in relation to their treatment, the fear of being seen as paternalistic or disrespectful of patient autonomy should no mean that doctors automatically apply the same checklist in all cases.\n\n\n\nModels of the Doctor–Patient Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of paternalism originated in the 1880s, with its fundamental idea being the “principle and practice of paternal administration, government by a father.” Drawing an analogy with a father, paternalism assumes two aspects of the paternal role: the father acting benevolently in line with his understanding of his children’s interests and making decisions about their well-being instead of letting them decide. In healthcare relationships, this analogy extends further, asserting that professionals, with their superior training and knowledge, hold an authoritative position to determine the patient’s best interests. Hence, the central principle in this model is beneficence.\nPaternalism always entails some form of interference or refusal to comply with an individual’s preferences regarding their well-being. Paternalistic actions often involve force, coercion, deception, lying, manipulation of information, or withholding information. Various forms of paternalism exist:\n\nStrong paternalism implies that the patient is competent to give consent, but the doctor does not afford them the opportunity, withholding sufficient information.\nWeak paternalism indicates that the patient is unable to comprehend the provided information due to factors like youth, mental illness, or incapacity.\n\nContemporary ethics generally rejects strong paternalism, except in rare instances like mandatory treatment for certain infectious diseases with quarantine measures or obligatory tests in specific professions. Antipaternalists argue that strong paternalistic intervention cannot be justified as it violates individual rights and excessively restricts free choice. On the other hand, weak paternalism finds justification in emergency situations or when the patient cannot make decisions due to pain, stress, unconsciousness, or shock. It is deemed acceptable for young children, very old patients, and mentally ill patients, especially in emergency situations where there’s no time for surrogate decision-making. In these cases, the prevention of harm or the provision of benefits usually outweighs the loss of independence, given the person’s limited ability to make autonomous choices.\nThere are also distinctions between active and passive paternalism.\n\nActive paternalism occurs when a patient prefers non-intervention\nPassive paternalism involves a professional’s refusal to carry out a patient’s positive preferences for paternalistic reasons.\n\nPassive paternalism is generally more justifiable than active paternalism, as physicians are not morally obligated to satisfy a patient’s desires if they conflict with accepted medical standards or the physician’s conscience.\n\n\n\nThe model is sometimes referred to as the scientific engineering or consumer model. In this approach, the goal of the interaction between the physician and patient is for the physician to furnish the patient with all pertinent information. The patient, in turn, selects the medical interventions they desire, which is carried out the by the doctor. In this context, the physician educates the patient about their disease state, potential diagnostic and therapeutic options, the risks and benefits associated with these interventions, and any uncertainties in knowledge.\nThe informative model presupposes a distinct separation between facts and values. The patient’s values are assumed to be well-defined and known; what the patient lacks is factual information. The physician’s duty is to provide all available facts, with the patient’s values determining the course of treatment. There is no room for the physician’s values, or judgment. In the informative model, the physician functions as a conveyor of technical expertise, offering the patient the means to exert control. The concept of patient autonomy in this model revolves around the patient’s control over medical decision-making.\nIn its most extremes form of this model, physicians are viewed as the services or commodities they provide—essentially, mere products. Consequently, the doctor-patient relationship in this model is highly asymmetrical, differing significantly from the partnership model and, in some aspects, can be seen as the complete opposite of the paternalist model. Analee and Thomas Beisecker succinctly encapsulate the consumer metaphor in the doctor-patient relationship with the following points: “Consumerism focuses on rights; consumerism assumes the doctor is self-centered; consumerism replaces trust with accountability; consumerism presumes that the patient’s health care values dominate; consumerism may require third-party supervision.” The underlying assumption of the consumer model is that the interests of the physician and the patient diverge, and the sole person genuinely concerned about the patient’s health is the patient. Crucially, in this context, the specific distribution of power lies in the hands of the patient: “In a consumerist relationship, the seller has no particular authority; power rests in the buyer who can make the decisions to buy or not to buy as he or she sees fit.”\n\n\n\nThis model closely follows the informative model but provides a greater role for the doctor to assist the patient in understanding her values and interests, and the possible impact of different interventions in these terms. The doctor acts as an advisor to help the patient “elucidate and make coherent” their values but does not pass judgement on these values or attempt to prioritize them on behalf of the patient. The ultimate choice of intervention still rests with the patient in the interpretive model, but the doctor plays a more active role in shaping this choice. Similar to the informative physician, the interpretive physician imparts information about the nature of the condition and the potential risks and benefits of interventions. However, the interpretive physician goes beyond this by helping the patient articulate and comprehend their values, aiding in determining which medical interventions best reflect those values.\nIn the interpretive model, the patient’s values are not necessarily fixed and may not be fully understood by the patient. They might be unclear, in flux, or conflicting in specific situations. In extreme cases, the physician may view the patient’s life as a narrative whole, specifying the patient’s values and their priority, and then identifying tests and treatments that align with these values. Importantly, the physician does not dictate to the patient.\n\n\n\nIn the deliberative model, the goal of the physician-patient interaction is to assist the patient in determining and selecting the most appropriate health-related values that can be actualized in the clinical context. The physician accomplishes this by providing information about the patient’s clinical situation and helping to clarify the types of values inherent in the available options. The physician’s objectives extend to suggesting why certain health-related values are more commendable and should be pursued.\nThis model closely follows the interpretive model but gives the doctor a greater role in judging and prioritizing patient values.** It is the doctor’s role to “elucidate the types of values embodied in the available options, suggesting why certain health-related values are more worthy and should be aspired to.”.

There is an automatic presumption that gifts from industry always carry an influence toward a product, service, or prescribing practice. Gifts from industry are viewed differently because there can be no other intention behind them except to buy influence and alter behavior. There is no such automatic presumption on the part of gifts received from patients."

    "text": "Sexual contact between a physician and a patient is always inappropriate. It is unclear if there can ever be a completely acceptable, ethical way to alter the physician/patient relationship so that sexual contact is acceptable. At the very least, the physician and patient must mutually agree to end the formal professional relationship of a doctor and a patient. It is not clear how much time must elapse between the ending of the professional doctor/ patient relationship and the beginning of a personal relationship. The recommendation for psychiatrists is somewhat unique. The American Psychiatric Association guidelines specifically state that there can never be a sexual or personally intimate private relationship between doctor and patient even after the professional relationship has ended. In other words, a psychiatrist should not have sexual contact even with former patients. These guidelines apply no matter who initiates the relationship. In other words, it is not more acceptable for a doctor and patient to have sexual relations if the patient initiates the sexual relationship rather than the physician. These guidelines also take no account of gender or sexual orientation. It is always ethically unacceptable to have a sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and either a current or a former patient. It is ethically unacceptable for a physician of any kind to have a sexual relationship with a current patient."

    "text": "Observational Studies\n\nDefinition - In observational studies, the researcher describes what has been observed in a particular sample without intervening in the observed processes in any way. They include studies that can be called descriptive or analytical.\nTypes - Observational studies are divided into descriptive and analytical.\n\nDescriptive Studies - There is no control group for comparison. Descriptive studies are intended to describe the distribution of one or more variables without considering any cause-and-effect relationship. These studies are suitable for generating ideas and hypotheses for research projects.\nAnalytical Studies are used to test hypotheses about the significance of potetial factors for the occurrence of diseases. They go further by analysing relationships between health status and other variables\n\n\n\nDescriptive Studies\n\nCase Reports\n\nDefinition: Reporting events in a single individual is termed as a case report. They are easy to report but often sound anecdotal and are usually non-repeatable. There is a high likelihood of the conclusions drawn in this type of study being due to chance or errors. Nevertheless, they can be used to formulate hypotheses. They are widely used in research on rare diseases to present new conditions and syndromes or unusual presentations of common diseases.\nAdvantages:\n\nThe only way to describe and publish rare diseases and syndromes OR unusual presentations of common diseases.\nSource of hypotheses for etiology, treatment, and disease outcome, which can later be evaluated through more complex epidemiological studies.\nProvide detailed and crucial information on disease pathogenesis, development, and treatment.\nServe as a bridge between laboratory and clinical research work.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nHighly susceptible to systematic errors due to the small number of cases, especially when reports comment on treatment or survival.\nCannot be directly translated into clinical practice due to the high level of uncertainty.\n\n\nCase Series\n\nDefinition: This type of study tracks several individuals. Case series are suitable for studying rare diseases. They also have low evidential value but are extremely valuable for discovering new diseases, symptoms, etiological factors, correlational dependencies, and prognostic factors.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Studies\nIn this type of study, researchers report the similarities and differences between participants in two or more groups. These studies are suitable for investigating the relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Depending on the starting point and the temporal direction, they can be prospective or retrospective.\n\nEcological Studies\n\nDefinition: The units of analysis are populations (groups, communities, or political units). In these studies, data are not observed and collected for individual units but for larger groups. They are also called correlational studies and usually track changes in two or more variables at the community level over several consecutive years. Ecological studies can also be done by comparing populations in different places at the same time or, in a time series, by comparing the same population in one place at different times. Presumed “risk” factors are compared with “unexposed” population groups. It represents an efficient and cost-effective epidemiological design that can leverage data already collected for other purposes. Although simple to conduct and thus attractive, ecological studies are often difficult to interpret since it is seldom possible to examine directly the various potential explanations for findings. Ecological studies usually rely on data collected for other purposes; data on different exposures and on socioeconomic factors may not be available. In addition, since the unit of analysis is a group, the link between exposure and effect at the individual level can not be made. One attraction of ecological studies is that data can be used from populations with widely differing characteristics or extracted from different data sources.\nAdvantages:\n\nEasy data acquisition\nNo contact with individuals or follow-up required\nSources of hypotheses for the etiological link between exposure and disease.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack temporal dimension -&gt; cannot prove causality\nCannot prove that a causal relationship truly exists\nEcological fallacy - the error that occurs when researchers directly transfer observed associations and relationships from population to individual levels.\n\n\nCross-sectional Studies\n\nDefinition: Through this type of study, the frequency of exposure (risk factor) and the presence of an event (outcome) in a population can be determined at a specific point in time. Researchers do not follow up with the participants, so information about the temporal sequence of events cannot be provided. Cross-sectional studies measure the prevalence of disease and thus are often called prevalence studies. It is not easy to assess the reasons for associations shown in cross-sectional studies. The key question to be asked is whether the exposure precedes or follows the effect. If the exposure data are known to represent exposure before any effect occurred, the data from a cross-sectional study can be treated like data generated from a cohort study. Cross-sectional studies are relatively easy and inexpensive to conduct and are useful for investigating exposures that are fixed characteristics of individuals, such as ethnicity or blood group. In sudden outbreaks of disease, a cross-sectional study to measure several exposures can be the most convenient first step in investigating the cause. Data from cross-sectional studies are helpful in assessing the health care needs of populations. Data from repeated cross-sectional surveys using independent random samples with standardized definitions and survey methods provide useful indications of trends. Many countries conduct regular cross-sectional surveys on representative samples of their populations focusing on personal and demographic characteristics, illnesses and health-related habits. Frequency of disease and risk factors can then be examined in relation to age, sex and ethnicity. Cross-sectional studies of risk factors for chronic diseases have been done in a wide range of countries.\nAdvantages:\n\nCan study entire populations or representative samples\nProvide information about disease prevalence\nGood opportunities for generalizing results\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack a time dimension -&gt; cannot prove causality\nSusceptible to systematic errors related to sampling and classification\nDifficult to apply to rare diseases\n\n\nCase-Control Studies\n\nDefinition: In this type of study, participants are divided into two or more groups depending on the presence or absence of the outcome under investigation (disease, health condition). Participants who have experienced the event (cases) are compared with those where the event is absent (controls) regarding the presence of the studied risk factor in the past. Case-control studies are retrospective. They are suitable for investigating the causes of a specific event, especially valuable when there is a long period between exposure and outcome, as participants are not followed up. Case-control studies usually do not require much time and are not expensive, but sometimes it’s challenging to find an appropriate control group. Case-control studies provide a relatively simple way to investigate causes of diseases, especially rare diseases.\nSteps:\n\nThe first step in designing case-control studies is selecting cases.\nThe second step is matching - a procedure to balance the studied groups in terms of key socio-demographic factors (gender, race, age, education, socio-economic status, etc.). It is also applied to control their confounding effect on the outcome. It can be performed at the group (frequency matching) or individual level (pair matching).\nThe third step is eliminating systematic bias. The most common systematic errors in these studies are related to selection, information, mismatching, and overmatching.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSuitable for rare diseases\nTime and resource-efficient\nApplicable for quick assessment in chronic diseases\nCan be used to investigate new hypotheses\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nDifficult to establish whether the cause precedes the outcome\nSusceptible to systematic errors related to sampling and classification\nLack of representativeness\nIndirect risk assessment\nNot suitable for rare exposures\n\n\nCohort Studies - In this type of study, healthy participants are divided into two or more groups based on the presence or absence of a risk factor. They are followed up for a specified period, at the end of which the occurrence or absence of a predetermined event is determined. Usually cohort studies are prospective. They are suitable for establishing temporal cause-and-effect relationships and for studying multiple events\n\nDefinition: Cohort studies, also called follow-up or incidence studies, begin with a group of people who are free of disease, and who are classified into subgroups according to exposure to a potential cause of disease or outcome. Variables of interest are specified and measured and the whole cohort is followed up to see how the subsequent development of new cases of the disease (or other outcome) differs between the groups with and without exposure. Because the data on exposure and disease refer to different points in time, cohort studies are longitudinal. Cohort studies have been called prospective studies, but this terminology is confusing and should be avoided. The term “prospective” refers to the timing of data collection and not to the relationship between exposure and effect. Thus there can be both prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Cohort studies provide the best information about the causation of disease and the most direct measurement of the risk of developing disease. Although conceptually simple, cohort studies are major undertakings and may require long periods of follow-up since disease may occur a long time after exposure. For example, the induction period for leukaemia or thyroid cancer caused by radiation (i.e. the time required for the specific cause to produce an outcome) is many years and it is necessary to follow up study participants for a long time. Many exposures investigated are long-term in nature and accurate information about them requires data collection over long periods. However, in the case of tobacco use, many people have relatively stable habits and information about past and current exposure can be collected at the time the cohort is defined. In situations with sudden acute exposures, the cause-effect relationship for acute effects may be obvious, but cohort studies are also used to investigate late or chronic effects. As cohort studies start with exposed and unexposed people, the difficulty of measuring or finding existing data on individual exposures largely determines the feasibility of doing one of these studies. If the disease is rare in the exposed group as well as the unexposed group there may also be problems in obtaining a large enough study group. Since cohort studies take healthy people as their starting-point, it is possible to examine a range of outcomes(in contrast to what can be achieved in case-control studies). For example, the Framingham study– a cohort studythat began in 1948 – has investigated the risk factors fora wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and musculoskeletal disorders\nTypes:\n\nProspective cohort studies measure exposure in the cohort, then follow the cohort for a specified period and monitor the occurrence and development of the disease.\nRetrospective cohort studies involve the researcher identifying a population with existing historical exposure data. Then they analyze what happened to exposed and unexposed individuals over time, comparing disease occurrences in both groups. Compared to prospective, retrospective cohort studies take relatively less time since the follow-up period has already ended.\n\nExamples: A classic example of a cohort study is the Framingham Heart Study, conducted jointly by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (USA) and Boston University. The goal of the Framingham Heart Study is to identify common factors leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by following them over a long period in a large group of participants without apparent symptoms of CVD or without experiencing a heart attack or stroke. Careful observation of the study samples over the years has helped uncover the major risk factors for CVD - high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and lack of physical activity - as well as valuable information on other factors related to this issue, such as levels of blood triglycerides and HDL, age, gender, and psychological factors. This study has resulted in the publication of around 1400 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of modern medicine and has led to the development of effective treatment and prevention in clinical practice.\nAdvantages:\n\nSuitable for rare exposures\nCan establish cause-and-effect relationships\nProvide information on incidence\nCan study multiple outcomes of one exposure\nLess sensitive to errors due to subjectivity and technical reasons\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nExpensive and time-consuming\nPrematurely lost patients can lead to selection bias\nRequire large populations and samples\nEthical issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizes the applications of different observational studies"

    "text": "Experimental Studies\nIntervention or experimentation involves attempting to change a variable in one or more groups of people. This could mean the elimination of a dietary factor thought to cause allergy, or testing a new treatment on a selected group of patients. The effects of an intervention are measured by comparing the outcome in the experimental group with that in a control group. Since the interventions are strictly determined by the study protocol, ethical considerations are of paramount importance in the design of these studies. For example, no patient should be denied appropriate treatment as a result of participation in an experiment, and the treatment being tested must be acceptable in the light of current knowledge. Informed consent from study participants is required in almost all circumstances.\nNB! Studying risk factors is illegal.\n\nDefinition - Experimental studies involve interventional research where the exposure under investigation is applied by the researcher. The goal of experimental studies is to reveal possible cause-and-effect relationships by exposing one or more groups of patients to the action of a given factor (treatment) and then comparing the results with one or more control groups that have not been exposed to the same factor. In this type of study, the researcher decides which subjects should be “exposed” and which should not, which is why in epidemiology, experimental studies are considered the closest analogue to laboratory experiments.\nTypes of Studies\n\nCommunity Trials - Investigational studies conducted in real human communities, which may include interventions at individual levels, group levels, as well as mixed approaches.\nClinical Trials - Investigational studies testing new methods for screening, prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease conducted in a hospital setting.\nLaboratory Experimental Studies - Investigational studies typically conducted on animals or tissues in laboratories.\n\nTypes of Interventions\n\nPreventive - Aimed at prevention (e.g., testing a new vaccine).\nDiagnostic - Aimed at evaluating a new diagnostic procedure (e.g., comparing a new laboratory test with the gold standard).\nTherapeutic - Aimed at treatment (e.g., testing a new drug).\n\nTypes of Control Groups\n\nPlacebo Control Group\nDose-Response Control Group\nActive Control Group\nNo-Treatment Control Group\nHistorical Control Group\n\n\nScientific control in experimental methods is intended to minimize the effects of variables other than the independent variable. This approach significantly increases the reliability of the results obtained. Using controlled experiments eliminates the possibility of experimental errors and biases by the researcher. The controlled experiment compares the results obtained from experimental samples with control samples that are identical to the experimental ones except for one aspect, the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).\n\nNon-Randomized Concurrent Controlled Trials\nIn this type of study, the control group consists of participants treated at approximately the same time as the experimental group. Participants are allocated to one of the groups, but not at random - for example, comparing mortality rates from two hospitals, one of which uses an innovative health product while the other uses a standard one. Non-randomized studies have some advantages over randomized ones, such as addressing the ethical issue of treatment differences between groups and a greater likelihood of participation due to the lack of randomization. However, they also have several weaknesses:\n\nThe two groups may not be entirely comparable.\nLower sensitivity to detecting statistically significant differences, leading to the need to increase the sample size.\nPossibility of errors in participant allocation.\n\nThe advantages of non-randomized studies in terms of cost, lower difficulty, and acceptability by researchers and participants must be carefully weighed against the possibility of error in each individual case.\n\n\nCross-Over Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials\nThis is a type of randomized clinical trial where each participant serves as their own control. In the simplest case, there are two study periods, during the first period each participant is in one of the two groups (experimental or control), and during the second period - in the other. This means that half of the participants receive the interventions in sequence I-II, while the other half receive them in sequence II-I. This should happen provided that the effect of the first intervention is calculated to prevent errors in the results. This type of design reduces the required number of participants and the variability of the results, as each participant serves as a control for the intervention. However, it cannot always be applied, for example, when curing the disease from the first intervention, the participant cannot return to the initial condition.\n\n\nFactorial Studies\nSome studies investigate more than one intervention simultaneously. This is done using a factorial design, where this type of study shows how different interventions interact. The design of factorial studies is usually 2x2, but can be more complex than a fourfold table. For example, the ACCORD study investigates strict versus more liberal control of blood glucose with strict control of blood pressure or lipid profile. This type of design can also be used in crossover trials. The disadvantage of this type of study is the possibility of interaction between interventions and the need for a larger sample size. If the lack of interaction can be guaranteed, a slight increase in the number of participants will allow two experiments to be conducted in one.\n\n\nDropout Studies\nIn many studies, participants who receive a certain treatment discontinue it or switch to a lower dose. The goal is to assess the response when the treatment is discontinued or the dose is reduced. This way, the duration of the effect of an already proven intervention can be evaluated. For example, in a study on arterial hypertension, only 5% of participants whose treatment was discontinued while maintaining their regular diet remained with normal blood pressure values, compared to 39% of participants whose treatment was discontinued but were given instructions to change their diet (weight reduction and decreased intake of table salt). A major drawback of these studies is the strict selection of participants. Only those deemed by the treating physician to benefit from their participation are likely to be included. Those experiencing significant adverse reactions are unlikely to continue their participation. This would lead to an overestimation of the treatment effect and an underestimation of toxicity. Another drawback is the change in participants’ condition and disease over time. The design of these studies must adhere to the same rules that apply to other studies. Randomization, blinding, and adequate data analysis are equally important here.\n\n\nAdaptive Design Studies\nAdaptive design allows modification of the study protocol after obtaining new data, usually in the early phases. Many clinical trials are adaptive, with their protocol allowing changes in the intervention to achieve a certain goal.\nUsually, adaptations include:\n\nchanges in the dosing regimen of the intervention group;\nchange in therapy in the intervention or control group;\nadapting the sample size;\nadapting the study protocol after the occurrence of a specific event. A significant weakness of adaptive design is the potential for errors in implementing the adaptation.\n\n\n\nRandomized Clinical Trial (RCT)\n\nDefinition - A prospective study that evaluates the effect of a given intervention by comparing outcomes for participants between randomly assigned treated and control groups. RCTs are the gold standard for introducing new drugs.\nPhases\n\nPhase I - an early study to determine the levels of non-toxic doses in animals or small groups of healthy volunteers. It assesses the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of therapy.\n\nSingle Ascending Dose (SAD) Study - small doses of the drug are given to groups of several patients and observed for a certain period. If no side effects occur, a larger dose is given to another group of patients, and so on until intolerable side effects appear. At this stage, it is said that the drug has reached the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nMultiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Study - conducted to gain a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. In this study, a group of patients receives a low dose of the drug, with this dose sequentially increased to a predetermined level. Biological samples are regularly collected and analyzed to understand the drug’s metabolism in vivo.\n\nPhase II - evaluates the clinical efficacy of the therapy.\n\nPhase IIA - assesses dosing requirements.\nPhase IIB - assesses efficacy.\n\nPhase III - confirms effectiveness, monitors side effects, and compares with other treatment alternatives. Successful RCTs in this phase may apply for registration and marketing approval from regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and others.\nPhase IV - aims to discover rare and long-term side effects among a much larger population over an extended period of time.\n\nTerms\n\nRandomization - a method of assigning patients to two or more therapeutic options in which each patient has an equal chance of receiving any of the treatments. It minimizes differences between groups due to systematic error and potential confounding factors by evenly distributing individuals with certain characteristics among the groups (experimental and control).\n\nSimple randomization - random allocation of patients to groups, usually using a table of random numbers or computer-generated random numbers.\nCluster (block) randomization - conducted in groups of patients (clusters) or communities, where units are randomly allocated to intervention or non-intervention.\nStratified randomization - conducted in non-homogeneous populations within the groups, depending on specific participant characteristics (age, gender, or disease severity). The aim is to ensure a good balance of these factors across the groups.\n\nBlinding - a method that ensures that the subject, investigator, or outcome assessor is unaware of the intervention allocation. Masking is used to reduce potential systematic error.\n\nOpen-label study - all participants are aware of the assigned treatment.\nSingle-blind - only the subject is unaware of the assigned treatment.\nDouble-blind - both the subject and the investigator are unaware of the assigned treatment.\nTriple-blind - the subject, investigator, and outcome assessor are unaware of the assigned treatment.\n\nAllocation concealment - a term used to describe the procedure for protecting randomization so that treatment allocation remains unknown until the patient is enrolled in the study. Researchers are unaware of the exact details of the chosen randomization. Allocation concealment can be achieved through:\n\nSequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE).\nSequentially numbered containers.\nPharmacologically controlled.\nCentral randomization.\n\nCompliance - determines how strictly patients randomized in a given study follow medical recommendations and treatment. This is an important element, especially in outpatient clinical trials.\nPlacebo - a pharmaceutical substance that does not contain an active ingredient. In blinded studies, a placebo is often designed to mimic the active product.\nMulticenter study - conducted in more than one medical center or hospital, thereby recruiting a larger number of participants. It allows for the inclusion of a wider range of population groups and comparison of results between centers.\nN-of-1 clinical trial - a patient is given one treatment or another (or placebo), using a double-blind method for a short period of time. Results are evaluated after each period.\nWashout period - a period in a clinical trial during which subjects do not receive treatment, thereby eliminating the effects of previous treatments.\nIntention-to-treat analysis - analysis according to the assigned treatment received by the patients. The effect of a treatment may be best assessed by assessing the subject’s treatment intentions (the planned treatment regimen) rather than the treatment actually administered.\nExplanatory analysis - analysis based on the treatment received for which patients were randomized.\nEfficacy - the ability of the treatment to produce beneficial effects at the tested dose and for the disease for which it is intended.\nEffectiveness - the desired measure of the action of the drug on a given disease or condition, demonstrated by unequivocal facts from adequate and well-controlled studies.\n\nAdvantages\n\nProvide strong evidence of causality.\nCan investigate multiple outcomes from a single exposure.\nAllow for fewer systematic errors related to observation, subjectivity, technical details.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nExpensive and time-consuming.\nPrematurely dropped patients can lead to selection bias.\nEthical issues (Researching risk factors is prohibited)."

    "text": "Diagnosing the dying patient and preparing for death\nPatients should be diagnosed as early as possible. In some cases, recognising that a patient has a limited life expectancy may occur 12 months or so in advance of death. One of the tools that has been developed to identify such patients, and provide care for them in their last year, is the Gold Standards Framework. Originally developed in 2000 in England by the Department of Health End of Life Programme for use in a primary care setting, it was subsequently extended to other parts of the UK and to other care settings. Its main aims are to identify patients who will need palliative or supportive care, assess their needs, preferences and issues important to them and plan around those needs and preferences. It seeks to develop guidance that clinicians are able to recognise when a patient is dying, particularly when the individual enters the last hours or days of life.\nThe diagnosis of dying is often complex, irrespective of previous diagnosis or history. Uncertainty is frequently an integral part of the process and there are occasions when a patient who was thought to be dying lives longer than expected and vice versa. In 2009, for example, an analysis of over 4,500 hospital deaths indicated that health professionals were sometimes unable to judge that patients were dying. This led to inadequate implementation of appropriate care and poor communication with patients, relatives and in health teams. Even when it was clearly recognised on admission that some patients could not survive long, discussion that should have taken place about treatment limitation did not occur. When dying patients are correctly assessed, practical planning tools help to manage their current symptoms and anticipate others likely to occur. They help health professionals assess what medication may be needed to maintain symptom control and whether consideration should be given to withdrawing medication that is no longer achieving its therapeutic aim. These pathways require regular and frequent review of the patient’s condition by the healthcare team so that drug doses can be tailored to match the individual patient’s needs. The use of pathways in the final days of life appears more evident with adult rather than paediatric patients, for whom the range of life-limiting conditions is very broad."

    "section": "Communication when patients are approaching death",
    "text": "Communication when patients are approaching death\nFor some death comes quickly and unexpectedly but for many patients there is a period of time when it is clear that death is approaching. This should be identified as early as possible (ideally, when death is likely to occur within 12 months) so that discussion and planning with the patient can take place, without urgency. It is a time for helping patients and families to come to terms with the situation. Within palliative care services, considerable attention has been given to developing good communication strategies to handle difficult situations openly, such as when patients ask for details about how their death will occur, and to the use of verbal and non-verbal skills to facilitate discussion\n\nPatients with capacity\nWhen making decisions about ongoing treatment and resuscitation with someone who has capacity, the doctor’s duty is to explain to the patient their options in a clear and honest manner. The doctor may advise, but must not put undue pressure on a patient to pursue a particular course of action. A patient with capacity might make decisions about there care that seem unwise to the medical team, for example, he might refuse surgery for a curable cancer. If a decision seems bizarre, it is acceptable to explore sensitively the reasoning behind it; however, the patient retains the right to control what happens to his body, and his decisions must be respected and acted upon, even if they are not rational or understood. Although adults with capacity may refuse treatment, no patient may demand treatment that the doctor does not deem to be in his best interests.\n\n\nPatients lacking capacity\nBefore losing capacity, a patient may entrust to another who is then authorized to make decisions on their behalf when capacity is diminished. the attorney must have been granted specifically the power to make medical decisions. The attorney must make decisions in the patient’s best interests and not simply make substituted judgements. Efforts should also be made to discover if the patient has made any advance decisions about their end of life care. These decisions may be recorded in legally drawn up documents or take the form of conversations recorded in the hospital notes. It is good practice to get the patient to countersign the transcript of any conversation where significant decisions are made during an admission. As stated previously, advance requests for treatment are not legally binding, although they help gain an insight into the patient’s wishes and so will be given weight when deciding how to proceed in their best interests. In some countries a valid advance refusal of treatment is legally binding and must be respected.\n\n\nThe patient who ‘doesn’t want to know’\nIf a patient does not wish to know the facts surrounding their illness or condition, sensitive attempts should be made to find out why. the patient’s worries should be addressed but if all attempts to help them engage in conversation fail, their wishes must be respected. No one else may give consent to treatment or investigation on their behalf while they retain capacity, even at the patient’s request. for consent to be legally valid, it must be ‘informed’, and so this leaves the medical team in a difficult position should they wish to proceed to investigation and treatment as, technically, they are committing assault because the patient’s consent is not truly valid. this dilemma should be explained to the patient. Most doctors would agree that they would proceed, pragmatically. Without bullying or coercion, the patient’s decision to remain ignorant should be revisited regularly. All discussion should be recorded in the notes.\n\n\nDiscussions with family members\nFamilies often have complicated dynamics. If a patient has capacity, they must give their permission before information about them can be discussed with anyone else. In the case of those who lack capacity, it is reasonable to assume that they would want those closest to them to be kept informed of their condition.\n\n\nCommunicating with complementary therapists\nSome disciplines, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, are professionally regulated and so health professionals can liaise with such practitioners with confidence that they are competent in the therapies they provide and are legally accountable for them. Others, such as herbal medicine and homeopathy are not regulated in the same way, but claim to provide diagnosis and treatment. Doctors may be worried if patients choose these and decline treatments for which there is evidence of benefit. In such cases, they need to talk to the patient about their concerns, while recognising that ultimately patients can choose whichever therapy they want Among the therapies that are often used by patients to supplement conventional medicine but which do not claim to have any diagnostic purpose are aromatherapy, massage, stress therapy, reflexology and hypnotherapy. Practitioners of these therapies can provide supportive care without impeding conventional treatment. Some other alternative disciplines which do not impede conventional care are perceived as lacking any credible evidence base, such as crystal therapy and iridology. Among the complementary disciplines that claim to provide diagnoses and treatment are Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Patients may derive a sense of reassurance that they are trying all options if they embark on such alternative solutions. Dilemmas arise for the healthcare team if patients appear to be pursuing unproven therapies that are potentially harmful or which they cannot afford. It can also be problematic if unregulated practitioners request medical tests or results from the healthcare team. Generally, doctors would need to be convinced that such interventions are necessary in the patient’s interests before providing them."

Ways of measuring whether patient choice works in practice include defined outcome measures, such as whether patients can be given a choice about place of death. Care standards are also measured through patient, carer and family feedback, such as by a patient or carer diary which can be more informative than questionnaires.

    "text": "The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient\nWhen patients are recognised as dying, their treatment needs to be continually monitored and assessed. The best known tool to manage the care of dying adults is the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP). The LCP was developed in the late 1990s and has been continuously updated. In 2004, it was highlighted as an example of best practice. LCP generic version helps health professionals to focus on care in the last hours or days of a patient’s life, ensuring that high quality care is tailored to individuals’ needs when their death is expected. As with all other clinical guidelines, the LCP does not replace clinical judgement. Using it requires regular assessment, reflection, critical senior decision making and clinical skill. Changes in care at this complex, uncertain time need to be reviewed regularly by the multi-disciplinary team so that decisions are made in the best interests of patients with input from their family or carers. The LCP does not preclude the use of clinically assisted nutrition or hydration or antibiotics; all such decisions should reflect an assessment of the patient’s best interests. The responsibility for the use of the LCP generic document as part of a continuous quality improvement programme sits within the governance of an organisation and must be underpinned by an education and training programme. The main goals of the LCP are given below\n\nGoal 1.1 The patient is able to take a full and active part in communication\nGoal 1.2 The relative or carer is able to take a full and active part in communication\nGoal 1.3 The patient is aware that they are dying\nGoal 1.4 The relative or carer is aware that the patient is dying\nGoal 1.5 The clinical team have up-to-date contact information for the relative or carer as documented below\nGoal 2 The relative or carer has had a full explanation of the facilities available to them and a facilities leaflet has been given\nGoal 3.1 The patient is given the opportunity to discuss what is important to them at this time (e.g. their wishes, feelings, faith, beliefs, values)\nGoal 3.2 The relative or carer is given the opportunity to discuss what is important to them at this time (e.g. their wishes, feelings, faith, beliefs, values)\nGoal 4.1 The patient has medication prescribed on a prn (if needed) basis for all of the following five symptoms which may develop in the last hours or days of life:\n\npain\nagitation\nrespiratory tract secretions\nnausea/vomiting\ndyspnoea.\n\nGoal 4.2 Equipment is available for the patient to support a continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of medication where required\nGoal 5.1 The patient’s need for current interventions has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\n\nroutine blood tests\nintravenous antibiotics\nblood glucose monitoring\nrecording of routine vital signs\noxygen therapy\n\nGoal 5.2 The patient has a ‘do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation order’ in place\nGoal 5.3 Implantable cardioverter defibrillator is deactivated\nGoal 6 The need for clinically assisted (artificial) nutrition is reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\nGoal 7 The need for clinically assisted (artificial) hydration is reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\nGoal 8 The patient’s skin integrity is assessed\nGoal 9.1 A full explanation of the current plan of care (LCP) is given to the patient\nGoal 9.2 A full explanation of the current plan of care (LCP) is given to the relative or carer\nGoal 9.3 The LCP Coping with dying leaflet or equivalent is given to the relative or carer\nGoal 9.4 The patient’s primary health care team/GP practice is notified that the patient is dying\n\n\n\n\nThe Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient algorithm.

    "text": "Use of opioids and sedatives\n\nThe principle of double effect\nThe principle of ‘double effect’ allows doctors to provide medical treatment that has both bad and good effects, as long as the intention is to provide an overall good effect. They can give sedatives and analgesics with the intention of, and in proportion to, the relief of suffering, even if as a consequence the patient’s life risks being shortened. The moral distinction is between intending and foreseeing the harm. The intention of giving the drugs is to relieve pain and distress; the harmful, but unintended, effect is the risk of shortening life, which the doctor may foresee but not intend.\nPain-relieving drugs, such as morphine, do not necessarily hasten death but a common example of double effect is using morphine when it might do so. The administration of drugs which might hasten death is lawful and ethical when patients are terminally ill or dying, the drugs are in their best interests and the doctor’s motive is the relief of suffering, not causing death. The actual treatment and dosage must be recognised as reasonable and proper within the profession. Although the ethical and legal situation is clear, some doctors remain anxious about the degree of pain relief they can provide. They might be reluctant to increase a drug dosage to cope with patient’s intractable pain or distress, in which case they need to take specialist advice. Some patients have been fearful that their mental distress or sense of panic, as well as physical symptoms, would not be adequately managed at the end of life.\n\n\nSedation at the end of life\nAlleviating suffering is a very high priority in end of life care but intentionally reducing patients’ awareness, even with their consent, is a serious matter requiring careful examination of doctors’ motives and the availability of possible alternatives. Clearly, sedation can never be a substitute for personalised assessment and treatment of patients’ physical symptoms and their psychological distress. Some people experience severe symptoms in the final days of life, either due to the terminal illness or to coexisting pathologies. Specialist palliative care teams help patients with previously intractable pain, delirium, anxiety or dyspnoea to become comfortable and, in the majority of cases, symptom control can be achieved. In some cases, medication is given with the intention of relieving pain or agitation with the knowledge that one of the side effects is temporary sedation. Because the aim is to relieve patients’ distress, often this does not mean reducing their consciousness to a level where all communication with them is impossible. Various terms are used in the international literature to describe a deep level of sedation, including ‘end of life sedation’, ‘total sedation’, ‘controlled sedation’, ‘sedation for intractable distress in the imminently dying’. Although there has been much debate on the subject, lack of common definitions has made it difficult to evaluate how much or how little, sedation is used and in what circumstances."

    "text": "Spiritual and pastoral care\nOne facet of ‘whole person’ care is offering the opportunity to receive spiritual or psychological support. For many patients, the spiritual dimension is immensely important, and particularly so at the end of life. This is not restricted to people who have a particular philosophy, world view or religious belief; many who have none of these things would like support to help them think about the values that have been important to them. A range of advisers may be helpful, including humanist counsellors, as well as hospital chaplains, rabbis, imams or other faith-based spiritual advisers. In a multifaith, multi-cultural society, it is important that professionals providing care and support to people nearing the end of life take account of individuals’ varying spiritual needs. Ideally, these should be assessed before people reach the terminal or dying phase of illness. This gives them time to explore issues that may be troubling them before they reach the very end of life. When patients wish to talk to a hospital chaplain or other religious or spiritual adviser, every effort should be made to accommodate this but confidential information about patients should not be given to spiritual advisers by health professionals, without prior patient consent. Alternatively, the dying person may indicate a desire to discuss personal, moral or spiritual problems with health professionals."

    "text": "Palliative care for children and young people\nPalliative care for children and young people with life-limiting conditions is defined as an active and total approach to care, embracing physical, emotional, social and spiritual elements. It focuses on enhancement of quality of life for the child and support for the family and includes the management of distressing symptoms, provision of respite and care through death and bereavement. It centres on ‘the need to maintain quality of life, not just in the dying stages, but also in the weeks, months and years before death and is characterised by concern for symptom relief, promotion of general well-being and psychological and social comfort for the child and family’. Such care involves an active approach to the management of the child’s symptoms and the provision of psychological, emotional and social support which ideally begins long before the dying stage. It requires the provision of flexible respite care and support for the family and siblings, throughout the illness, death and bereavement. Children and young people often have complex, long-term conditions that require more specialist care and higher levels of home and community support than adults. Care also needs to take account of the child’s or young person’s emotional and cognitive development. Educational needs and the provision of play therapies may have to be planned. The continuing physical, emotional and cognitive development of children also influences all aspects of their care. The transition between active treatment and palliative care is often less clear for children than for adults, particularly when children have genetic disorders with different clinical manifestations to those encountered in other life-threatening conditions. Many professional and voluntary agencies are involved in different aspects of the care of a seriously ill child and the family."

Good communication and team care should ideally have been initiated at an early stage and this may help to ease the pain of bereavement. Although expected deaths do not represent a shock to the staff who have been caring for the patient, the death of a loved one, however expected, is often a shock for friends and family. Much preparatory work falls to the nursing staff or to GPs. After the patient has died, it is usual and comforting to see death as a release for the patient, but a sense of guilt and fear of criticism often prevent people from also admitting beforehand that the death of the patient may represent a relief for them. The family should be encouraged to discuss any concerns and, if appropriate, should be offered counselling. For parents, the death of a child is the most devastating experience they can have. Hospitals should have appropriate policies in place so that staff are aware of the needs of different cultures at this time and so that the family can be given information, if relevant, about asking for a post-mortem examination or donating tissue or organs."

    "text": "Terms and definitions\n\nAssisted dying is an overarching term to describe measures intentionally designed to terminate a person’s life. It is normally applied to patients who voluntarily seek to end heir lives and who have a terminal or degenerative condition. It includes euthanasia and physician assisted suicide but does not cover non-treatment decisions.\nEuthanasia literally means a gentle or easy death. It is sometimes called ‘mercy killing’. It describes deliberate steps by someone – usually a health professional – to end a patient’s life.\n\n-Withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment is fundamentally different from assisted dying. Doctors must withhold or withdraw treatment when a patient with capacity refuses it or when a patient who lacks capacity has made a valid advance decision to refuse it. Nor can doctors give treatment that is futile in that it cannot achieve its aim or cannot provide a ‘benefit’ to the patient\n\nSlippery slope is the metaphor often invoked in debates about assisted dying to describe situations in which one action might possibly be seen as permissible but would lead to undesirable consequences. Once an accepted boundary is breached, the argument goes, there will be no way of preventing a slide down the slippery slope to the breaching of other standards."

Instead, a proxy, who considers death to be in their best interests, makes the decision for them.\nEuthanasia is involuntary when a patient does not want their life to be ended, but their wishes are disregarded. this term is rather an oxymoron; murder might be more accurate"

    "text": "Moral, legal and pragmatic arguments\n\nArguments in support of assisted dying\nArguments for assisted dying are rights based, consequentialist and deontological. In terms of rights and consequences, assisted dying would allow some patients to achieve their aim of controlling their death and avoiding a situation which they fear will involve suffering or indignity. The main argument in favour of assisted dying focuses on this concept of patients’ rights to choose.\n\nIn terms of deontology, doctors have duties to respect patient choice and minimise suffering. They have special duties to their patients and cannot abandon patients who have unbearable pain.\nHuman rights also provide a similar focus on individual entitlements.\nQuality of life is often portrayed as being more important than the patient’s length of life and issues around sanctity of life.\nOpinion polls appear to show that the public support assisted dying being available in some cases.\nBoth sides of the argument raise questions about the kind of society we want and whether respect for choices and compassion for suffering should overrule other considerations\n\n\n\nArguments opposing assisted dying\nArguments against assisted dying are also consequentialist and deontological. The consequentialist argument is that permitting assisted dying for some would put large numbers of other people at risk of harm.\n\nThe deontological argument is that this would be contrary to the ethics of clinical practice. The purpose of medicine is perceived as being to improve patients’ quality of life and the opposite of trying to foreshorten it.\nThe issue of sanctity of life is sometimes raised as a cogent reason against assisted dying (although many opponents of assisted dying do not subscribe to the notion that life must be preserved at all costs, regardless of its quality).\nIt would weaken society’s prohibition on killing and undermine the safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia. Society would embark on a ‘slippery slope’ with undesirable consequences.\nEffective and high quality palliative care can effectively alleviate distressing symptoms associated with the dying process and allay patients’ fears.\nOnly a minority of people want to end their lives. The rules for the majority should not be changed to accommodate a small group.\nBoth sides of the argument raise questions about the kind of society we want and whether concern for the vulnerable and respect for life should count for more than individual autonomy."

Women are now able to exercise choice over whether and when to have children to a greater extent than ever before. Although emphasis is often placed on the provision of contraception to young women, boys and men also need advice about contraception and sexual health. Similarly, although decisions about the progress of a pregnancy ultimately rest with the woman carrying the fetus, fathers also have a role in decision making, particularly when they intend to take an active part in bringing up the child. Reproduction differs from many other areas of medical practice because of its complexity and because tension can sometimes arise between the rights of women to make decisions about their own bodies and the moral duties owed to embryos and fetuses. It is this aspect of reproduction that is at the root of many of the ethical, legal, social and psychological questions that continue to be of concern to society. Control over one’s body, abortion, reproduction and parenthood are matters about which most people hold strong views. For many, such views are based on moral, religious or cultural convictions. Given the existence of such diversity of opinion, it is clear that some of these questions can never be resolved to the satisfaction of all sections of society, but will be the subject of continuing ethical debate. Broad areas of moral consensus can, however, be sketched out after wide ranging consultation and public debate, and these form the basis of legislation, guidance and practice in this area."

    "text": "Arguments in support of abortion being made widely available\nThose who support the wide availability of abortion consider the matter to be primarily one of a woman’s right to choose and to exercise control over her own body. These arguments tend not to consider the fetus to be a person, deserving of any rights or owed any duties. Those who judge actions by their consequences alone could argue that abortion is equivalent to a deliberate failure to conceive a child and, because contraception is widely available, abortion should be too. Others take a slightly different approach, believing that, even if the fetus has rights and entitlements, these are very limited and do not weigh significantly against the interests of people who have already been born, such as parents or existing children of the family. Most people believe it is right for couples to be able to plan their families and for women to have control over when they become pregnant. Although contraception is understood to be the appropriate means to avoid unwanted pregnancy, all methods have a failure rate. When contraception fails, or when couples fail to use it effectively, many people accept that abortion is preferable to forcing a woman to continue with an unwanted pregnancy."

    "section": "Arguments against abortion",
    "text": "Arguments against abortion\nSome people consider that abortion is wrong in any circumstance because it fails to recognise the rights of the fetus or because it challenges the notion of the sanctity of all human life. They argue that permitting abortion diminishes the respect society feels for other vulnerable humans, possibly leading to their involuntary euthanasia. Those who consider that an embryo is a human being with full moral status from the moment of conception see abortion as intentional killing in the same sense as the murder of any other person. Those who take this view cannot accept that women should be allowed to obtain abortions, however difficult the lives of those women or their existing families are made as a result. Such views may be based on religious or moral convictions that each human life has unassailable intrinsic value, which is not diminished by any impairment or suffering that may be involved for the individual living that life. Many worry that the availability of abortion on grounds of fetal abnormality encourages prejudice towards any person with a handicap and insidiously creates the impression that the only valuable people are those who conform to some ill-defined stereotype of ‘normality’. More recently, some have shifted the arguments on to the pregnant woman and have argued that abortion is wrong because of the psychological and health consequences for a woman, although evidence in support of this is elusive and controversial. Some of those who oppose abortion in general nevertheless concede that it may be justifiable in very exceptional cases when termination is seen as the lesser moral offence. This could include cases such as where the pregnancy is the result of rape, or the consequence of the exploitation of a young girl or a woman lacking capacity. Risk to the mother’s life may be another justifiable exception, but only when abortion is the only option. It would thus not be seen as justifiable to abort a fetus if the life of both fetus and mother could be saved by implementing any other solution."

It may also be performed in cases of severe fetal abnormalities where the baby is not expected to survive after birth\nThis type of abortion is typically carried out with the guidance of healthcare professionals, using medication or surgical procedures to ensure the safety of the patient.\n\nSocial Abortion:\n\nSocial abortion, also known as elective abortion, is the termination of a pregnancy for non-medical reasons. It is a personal choice made by the pregnant person due to various factors, such as their life circumstances, financial situation, or personal beliefs.\nThe legality and availability of social abortions can vary widely from one region or country to another. Some places may have strict regulations or restrictions on elective abortions, while others may have more permissive laws.\n\nCriminal Abortion:\n\nCriminal abortion refers to an abortion that is performed in violation of the laws of a particular jurisdiction. This can encompass a wide range of circumstances, such as performing an abortion without proper medical training or in a setting that doesn’t meet legal standards.\nCriminal abortion may also refer to cases where abortion is considered illegal, regardless of the circumstances. The legality of abortion varies widely across the world, with some countries allowing it under certain conditions and others prohibiting it entirely."

The procedures of in vitro fertilization are also used in cases when we need to select among the fetuses to avoid genetic diseases. Ethical considerations here are similar to those in prenatal diagnostics: medicine supports the wishes of the parents to have only healthy children. Obviously, in vitro fertilization is ethically not acceptable when it serves to choose the gender or physical or mental characteristics of the child."

    "section": "Surrogate Motherhood",
    "text": "Surrogate Motherhood\nThe most significant deviation from natural conception and pregnancy is surrogate motherhood. Surrogacy arrangement means that the fetus is implanted into the womb of another woman who gives birth to the child and then gives the child to the “biological parents”. Surrogacy opens the door to severe abuse. The indication for surrogacy is often not a medical one, that is, the inability of the biological mother to carry a pregnancy and give birth, but rather the biological mother wants to avoid all the risks and discomforts of pregnancy and birth. In some parts of the world, for example, India, the so called rent-a-womb is already a well-established source of income for poor women. This practice is illegal in many countries and is ethically very problematic. Few healthy women would accept the role of a surrogate mother purely for altruistic motives, and in the large majority of cases, it is the money that drives the decision. Surrogate motherhood is a clear case of disrespect of the ethical principle of justice. Ethically, it is hard to defend exploitation of the poor, who are forced to put their health and well-being at risk. The second problematic issue is that pregnancy is not merely a waiting time, but rather a precious period for both parents to prepare for their new role. Talking, or singing to a child before birth, is a most common and enriching experience. Likewise, the father also gradually adapts to his new role. Thus, all events during pregnancy prepare the family for the great change in family life and for the (often difficult) period of caring for a newborn baby. This role of pregnancy as preparation for parenthood is missing if the only reminder of the new family member is a marked date on a calendar. Finally, we must also think of some unfortunate potential scenarios. What happens if the newborn child is not healthy? Would the “biological parents” return him or her as we do with malfunctioning washing machines in stores? If the surrogate mother during pregnancy or delivery gets a disease or even dies - who is responsible and who takes care of her other children?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Demographical data has been collected for centuries. The first known census was conducted in 3800 BC in Babylon. The first known census in Europe was conducted in 1086 in England. However, as a social science demography was established early in the sixteenth century, when an ordinance required parish priests in London to compile weekly lists of deaths from plague, called the Bills of Mortality. These were intended initially to identify outbreaks and areas for quarantine. Later, other causes of death were included, as well as weddings and christenings and the collection was extended to cover all English parishes. Disastrous plagues struck London in 1603 and again in 1625. In the latter year an estimated one quarter of the population of London died. Interest in population at the time centred on the effects of epidemics on population numbers, together with the new field of ‘political arithmetic’, concerned with estimating national wealth. Yet seventeenth century London produced the founder of demography, John Graunt (1620-74), a ‘prosperous and intelligent’ cloth merchant who became interested in the Bills of Mortality. He had no scientific training, and he ‘knew not by what accident’ he was moved to begin the studies that led to his book. Graunt’s Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality, quickly brought him scientific recognition.\nGraunt’s book ranged across many important questions including causes of death, proportions surviving at different ages, health and the environment, the balance of the sexes, family size, age structure, employment, population estimates, population growth and its components and the need for social statistics in public administration. Cambridge demographer Peter Laslett described Graunt as ‘ranking among the great natural scientists of the early years of the Royal Society’ and his little book as ‘universally recognized as a work of genius’. Graunt demonstrated the potential for systematic study of population and he is the acknowledged founder of demography.\n\n\n\n\nDemography is the study of population processes and characteristics. Demography is generally considered an interdisciplinary subject with strong roots in sociology and weaker, but still important, connections with economics, statistics, geography, human ecology, biology, medicine and human genetics. It is rarely thought of as a completely separate discipline, but rather as an interstitial subject or as a subdivision of one of the major fields\nMedical demography is an integrated social science that studies demographic processes closely related to the health of populations.\n\nNote! The demographic condition is one of the key elements describing public health. In demography, the term population refers to the inhabitants of a given territory at a given time. In statistics, population refers to a general aggregate.\n\n\n\nDemography studies the population in two main dimensions - demographic statics and demographic dynamics.\n\nDemographic Statics examines the population in terms of size and structure.\nDemographic Dynamics studies changes in the population resulting from natural events and migration.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Demographic statics represents a snapshot of the population. It studies the size, distribution, and structure of the population.\nMethods: The primary source of data for statics is the census. A census is a process of statistical observation. It involves the collection, processing, compilation, and publication of demographic, sociological, and economic information at a given time, covering all individuals in a country or specific territory. The census is a demographic study that also aims to compare data between different countries. Censuses are conducted every 10 years and must follow the following basic principles:\n\nState (government) funding: The costs required for the preparation, organization, execution, processing, and publication of census results are covered by the central budget.\nPrecisely defined territory: The 2021 census was conducted simultaneously in all European Union countries under a common regulation.\nExhaustiveness: Every individual is counted, not groups of people or households. Individuals who refuse to provide data to the census taker under Articles 17–19 of the Census Law are fined 160 BGN.\nSimultaneity: A specific moment (critical moment) is fixed, serving as a dividing line for inclusion or exclusion from the census.\nPeriodicity: Censuses are conducted at least every 10 years, preferably in years ending with “1.”\n\nDemographic structure: This refers to the distribution of a country’s population by gender, age, education, marital status, ethnicity, residence, employment, etc. The distribution of the population by one or more characteristics is presented in tabular or graphical form.\n\nPopulation size: As of December 31, 2023, Bulgaria’s population is 6,445,481. Of this, 4,738,461 (73.5%) live in urban areas, while 1,707,020 (26.5%) live in rural areas.\nThe most important characteristics in demography are gender and age. These are called basic demographic characteristics. The distribution of the population by gender and age is called the age-sex structure. This distribution is graphically represented by an age-sex pyramid. There are three types of age-sex pyramid structures:\n\nProgressive type: The population under 15 years old predominates.\nStationary type: Uniform distribution across all age groups.\nRegressive type: The population aged 65 and over predominates.\n\nPopulation aging:\n\nDefinition: The change in the age structure of the population, where the relative share of elderly people increases, and the share of children and young people decreases. Demographic aging is a complex restructuring process, but it can be expressed through a simple indicator: the average age of the population. In 2022, the average age of Bulgaria’s population was 45.2 years.\nTypes:\n\nAging from the top of the age pyramid: A process of expanding the upper part of the age pyramid as the percentage of people surviving to higher ages increases, causing the top of the pyramid to widen.\nAging from the base: Fewer children are being born.\n\nIndicators of population aging:\n\nRelative share of the population aged 65 and over compared to the average annual population: At the end of 2023, individuals aged 65 and over numbered 1,530,909, or 23.8% of the country’s population. Compared to 2022, the share of this age group increased by 0.3 percentage points.\nChild dependency ratio: The number of children relative to the working-age population (15–64 years).\nOld-age dependency ratio: The number of people aged 65 and over relative to the working-age population (15–64 years).\nTotal dependency ratio: The dependent population (under 15 and over 65) relative to the working-age population. As of December 31, 2023, Bulgaria’s total dependency ratio is 61.0%, meaning there are fewer than two working-age individuals for every dependent individual. This ratio is more favorable in urban areas (57.6%) than in rural areas (71.3%). In all regions of the country, this indicator exceeds 50.0%. The lowest value is in Sofia (51.5%), while the most unfavorable ratios are in Vidin (74.8%), Gabrovo, and Yambol (72.3% each).\nReplacement ratio: The ratio between the number of individuals entering working age (15–19 years) and those leaving working age (60–64 years). As of December 31, 2023, the replacement ratio is 69.\n\n\nTerritorial distribution:\n\nDemographic studies often use population distributions by territory (by regions, settlements, municipalities, etc.), as well as by countries and continents.\nThis allows for the calculation of population density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic dynamics assess the changes in a population resulting from natural events and migration. Natural events include births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. Dynamics are divided into migrational and natural. Data for studying demographic dynamics are derived from population registers - the unified system for civil registration and administrative servicing of the population. Natural events are recorded through standardized documents - medical certificate for birth (certificat for live birth), marriage certificates, divorce certificates, medical certificate of the causes of death, current address, and personal registration cards.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: The demographic transition model is theoretically based on the historical development of birth and death rates. The model is fundamental and describes population dynamics.\nStructure: The model primarily involves two parameters: crude death rates and crude birth rates. Empirical data show that the development of societies (in Europe and other continents) leads to a point where the death rate begins to decline sharply. This stage is associated with industrialization and related processes of improved living standards, hygiene, healthcare, etc. According to the model, the decline in the death rate naturally leads to a decline in the birth rate, so that after a certain period, the two processes balance at a lower level.\nStages: The model includes five stages (phases), which are theoretically defined, as each country and region has specific manifestations of these phases, and some countries may lack certain phases entirely.\n\nFirst stage:\n\nEssence: High birth and death rates, which are approximately balanced. Natural growth is low.\nCauses: High mortality due to epidemics, wars, and famine. High fluctuating birth rates influenced by religious beliefs.\n\nSecond stage:\n\nEssence: Declining death rates, especially infant mortality; increasing life expectancy. High natural growth.\nCauses: Improved sanitary and living conditions. Improved quality and access to healthcare. Effective measures against infectious diseases. Pronatalist policies.\n\nThird stage:\n\nEssence: Declining birth rates with a steady decline in death rates. Natural growth is positive but at a reduced intensity, reaching a constant level.\nCauses: Sociophilosophical changes in the role of children and individuals in society. Initiation of gender equality processes. Declining birth rates. Nuclearization of the family. Urbanization.\n\nFourth stage:\n\nEssence: Stable model with zero natural growth. Fluctuations due to epidemics and baby booms.\nCauses: Mass participation of women in economic activity. Demographic policies. Family planning.\n\nFifth stage:\n\nEssence: Birth rates fall below the level of natural replacement. Decline in natural growth.\nCauses: Demographic aging.\n\n\nMechanisms: Changes in the population occur in two ways:\n\nChange by place: Different countries may be at different stages at a given time.\nChange over time: Theoretically, every country progresses through the stages."

    "text": "Demographical data has been collected for centuries. The first known census was conducted in 3800 BC in Babylon. The first known census in Europe was conducted in 1086 in England. However, as a social science demography was established early in the sixteenth century, when an ordinance required parish priests in London to compile weekly lists of deaths from plague, called the Bills of Mortality. These were intended initially to identify outbreaks and areas for quarantine. Later, other causes of death were included, as well as weddings and christenings and the collection was extended to cover all English parishes. Disastrous plagues struck London in 1603 and again in 1625. In the latter year an estimated one quarter of the population of London died. Interest in population at the time centred on the effects of epidemics on population numbers, together with the new field of ‘political arithmetic’, concerned with estimating national wealth. Yet seventeenth century London produced the founder of demography, John Graunt (1620-74), a ‘prosperous and intelligent’ cloth merchant who became interested in the Bills of Mortality. He had no scientific training, and he ‘knew not by what accident’ he was moved to begin the studies that led to his book. Graunt’s Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality, quickly brought him scientific recognition.\nGraunt’s book ranged across many important questions including causes of death, proportions surviving at different ages, health and the environment, the balance of the sexes, family size, age structure, employment, population estimates, population growth and its components and the need for social statistics in public administration. Cambridge demographer Peter Laslett described Graunt as ‘ranking among the great natural scientists of the early years of the Royal Society’ and his little book as ‘universally recognized as a work of genius’. Graunt demonstrated the potential for systematic study of population and he is the acknowledged founder of demography."

    "text": "Demography is the study of population processes and characteristics. Demography is generally considered an interdisciplinary subject with strong roots in sociology and weaker, but still important, connections with economics, statistics, geography, human ecology, biology, medicine and human genetics. It is rarely thought of as a completely separate discipline, but rather as an interstitial subject or as a subdivision of one of the major fields\nMedical demography is an integrated social science that studies demographic processes closely related to the health of populations.\n\nNote! The demographic condition is one of the key elements describing public health. In demography, the term population refers to the inhabitants of a given territory at a given time. In statistics, population refers to a general aggregate."

    "text": "Demography studies the population in two main dimensions - demographic statics and demographic dynamics.\n\nDemographic Statics examines the population in terms of size and structure.\nDemographic Dynamics studies changes in the population resulting from natural events and migration.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Demographic statics represents a snapshot of the population. It studies the size, distribution, and structure of the population.\nMethods: The primary source of data for statics is the census. A census is a process of statistical observation. It involves the collection, processing, compilation, and publication of demographic, sociological, and economic information at a given time, covering all individuals in a country or specific territory. The census is a demographic study that also aims to compare data between different countries. Censuses are conducted every 10 years and must follow the following basic principles:\n\nState (government) funding: The costs required for the preparation, organization, execution, processing, and publication of census results are covered by the central budget.\nPrecisely defined territory: The 2021 census was conducted simultaneously in all European Union countries under a common regulation.\nExhaustiveness: Every individual is counted, not groups of people or households. Individuals who refuse to provide data to the census taker under Articles 17–19 of the Census Law are fined 160 BGN.\nSimultaneity: A specific moment (critical moment) is fixed, serving as a dividing line for inclusion or exclusion from the census.\nPeriodicity: Censuses are conducted at least every 10 years, preferably in years ending with “1.”\n\nDemographic structure: This refers to the distribution of a country’s population by gender, age, education, marital status, ethnicity, residence, employment, etc. The distribution of the population by one or more characteristics is presented in tabular or graphical form.\n\nPopulation size: As of December 31, 2023, Bulgaria’s population is 6,445,481. Of this, 4,738,461 (73.5%) live in urban areas, while 1,707,020 (26.5%) live in rural areas.\nThe most important characteristics in demography are gender and age. These are called basic demographic characteristics. The distribution of the population by gender and age is called the age-sex structure. This distribution is graphically represented by an age-sex pyramid. There are three types of age-sex pyramid structures:\n\nProgressive type: The population under 15 years old predominates.\nStationary type: Uniform distribution across all age groups.\nRegressive type: The population aged 65 and over predominates.\n\nPopulation aging:\n\nDefinition: The change in the age structure of the population, where the relative share of elderly people increases, and the share of children and young people decreases. Demographic aging is a complex restructuring process, but it can be expressed through a simple indicator: the average age of the population. In 2022, the average age of Bulgaria’s population was 45.2 years.\nTypes:\n\nAging from the top of the age pyramid: A process of expanding the upper part of the age pyramid as the percentage of people surviving to higher ages increases, causing the top of the pyramid to widen.\nAging from the base: Fewer children are being born.\n\nIndicators of population aging:\n\nRelative share of the population aged 65 and over compared to the average annual population: At the end of 2023, individuals aged 65 and over numbered 1,530,909, or 23.8% of the country’s population. Compared to 2022, the share of this age group increased by 0.3 percentage points.\nChild dependency ratio: The number of children relative to the working-age population (15–64 years).\nOld-age dependency ratio: The number of people aged 65 and over relative to the working-age population (15–64 years).\nTotal dependency ratio: The dependent population (under 15 and over 65) relative to the working-age population. As of December 31, 2023, Bulgaria’s total dependency ratio is 61.0%, meaning there are fewer than two working-age individuals for every dependent individual. This ratio is more favorable in urban areas (57.6%) than in rural areas (71.3%). In all regions of the country, this indicator exceeds 50.0%. The lowest value is in Sofia (51.5%), while the most unfavorable ratios are in Vidin (74.8%), Gabrovo, and Yambol (72.3% each).\nReplacement ratio: The ratio between the number of individuals entering working age (15–19 years) and those leaving working age (60–64 years). As of December 31, 2023, the replacement ratio is 69.\n\n\nTerritorial distribution:\n\nDemographic studies often use population distributions by territory (by regions, settlements, municipalities, etc.), as well as by countries and continents.\nThis allows for the calculation of population density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic dynamics assess the changes in a population resulting from natural events and migration. Natural events include births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. Dynamics are divided into migrational and natural. Data for studying demographic dynamics are derived from population registers - the unified system for civil registration and administrative servicing of the population. Natural events are recorded through standardized documents - medical certificate for birth (certificat for live birth), marriage certificates, divorce certificates, medical certificate of the causes of death, current address, and personal registration cards.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: The demographic transition model is theoretically based on the historical development of birth and death rates. The model is fundamental and describes population dynamics.\nStructure: The model primarily involves two parameters: crude death rates and crude birth rates. Empirical data show that the development of societies (in Europe and other continents) leads to a point where the death rate begins to decline sharply. This stage is associated with industrialization and related processes of improved living standards, hygiene, healthcare, etc. According to the model, the decline in the death rate naturally leads to a decline in the birth rate, so that after a certain period, the two processes balance at a lower level.\nStages: The model includes five stages (phases), which are theoretically defined, as each country and region has specific manifestations of these phases, and some countries may lack certain phases entirely.\n\nFirst stage:\n\nEssence: High birth and death rates, which are approximately balanced. Natural growth is low.\nCauses: High mortality due to epidemics, wars, and famine. High fluctuating birth rates influenced by religious beliefs.\n\nSecond stage:\n\nEssence: Declining death rates, especially infant mortality; increasing life expectancy. High natural growth.\nCauses: Improved sanitary and living conditions. Improved quality and access to healthcare. Effective measures against infectious diseases. Pronatalist policies.\n\nThird stage:\n\nEssence: Declining birth rates with a steady decline in death rates. Natural growth is positive but at a reduced intensity, reaching a constant level.\nCauses: Sociophilosophical changes in the role of children and individuals in society. Initiation of gender equality processes. Declining birth rates. Nuclearization of the family. Urbanization.\n\nFourth stage:\n\nEssence: Stable model with zero natural growth. Fluctuations due to epidemics and baby booms.\nCauses: Mass participation of women in economic activity. Demographic policies. Family planning.\n\nFifth stage:\n\nEssence: Birth rates fall below the level of natural replacement. Decline in natural growth.\nCauses: Demographic aging.\n\n\nMechanisms: Changes in the population occur in two ways:\n\nChange by place: Different countries may be at different stages at a given time.\nChange over time: Theoretically, every country progresses through the stages."

It focuses on increasing birth rates.\nAntinatalist demographic policy: Aims to decrease birth rates.\nLiberal policy: Does not set a specific goal regarding birth rates. It serves as a means and combines methods from both pronatalist and antinatalist policies to improve overall demographic indicators.\n\nGoverning Bodies: The Council of Ministers leads, while the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) coordinates and oversees the implementation of state demographic policy, as well as activities related to analyzing, evaluating, and forecasting demographic processes.\nLegal Framework: The National Strategy for Demographic Development.\nDemographic Policy in Bulgaria - Moderate Pronatalist Policy:\n\nMeasures to protect families and children:\n\nFinancial compensations (paid maternity leave, one-time childbirth allowance, child benefits).\nNetwork of childcare facilities for raising and educating children.\nPrograms for maternal and child healthcare.\nLegal norms for protecting women’s reproductive abilities (occupational safety, prohibition of certain work activities, employment).\n\nHarmonizing women’s employment and motherhood.\nMeasures for education, social, and health protection for adolescents:\n\nPreferences in using public services for families with children.\nProvision of free, quality, and universally accessible education and healthcare.\n\nPromotion of family planning.

If the woman has been breastfeeding, the time for attempts at conception is calculated from the end of lactational amenorrhea.\n\nNumber of children:\n\nIdeal number of children: The number of children considered ideal for an individual’s perception of a “perfect family.” The ideal number of children depends on cultural, social, personal, and economic factors.\nDesired number of children: The number of children an individual or couple would like to have in the future, taking into account their fertility, partner preferences, access to family planning services, etc.\nPlanned number of children: The number of children a couple plans to have in the near future, considering housing conditions, socio-economic status, age, work conditions, etc. Example: According to one partner, the ideal family consists of 4 children (ideal number of children). However, due to reproductive problems, the partner desires 2 children (desired number), with the couple planning for one child (planned number) in the next two years.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nContraception, defined as any method to prevent pregnancy.\nTreatment for unwanted infertility.\n\nContraceptive Methods:\n\nTypes:\n\nTemporary methods include:\n\nBarrier methods: Placing a barrier to prevent sperm from entering the upper part of the female genital tract (e.g., condoms, diaphragms, spermicides).\nHormonal methods: Using reproductive hormones (e.g., oral pills, injections, long-acting implants).\nTraditional methods: Withdrawal; Utilizing natural periods of infertility (e.g., during breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea).\n\nPermanent methods: Permanent contraception methods include sterilization of men and women. NB! In Bulgaria, this contraception by choice is prohibited by law.\n\nPrinciples:\n\nAdequate information and counseling for family planning.\nTrained personnel for contraception requiring surgical intervention.\nAppropriate equipment, storage, and distribution of contraceptive methods.\n\n\nTreatment for Unwanted Infertility:\n\nMethods:\n\nWith own genetic material:\n\nMedication-based: Gonadotropin-based.\nIntrauterine insemination.\nIn vitro fertilization.\nSurrogate motherhood with material from the couple.\n\nWith donor genetic material:\n\nDonor egg/sperm.\nAdoption.\n\n\nPrinciples:\n\nDiagnosis of the cause of infertility.\nHigh-quality and safe medical interventions combined with psychological care.\nSocial support (including state funding).\n\n\nPublic Health Benefits of Family Planning:\n\nReduction in maternal and child mortality.\nReduction in sexually transmitted infections (STIs): Some family planning methods, such as condoms, can provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases.\nImprovement in maternal and child health: Family planning can also help improve maternal and child health by allowing women to plan and prepare for pregnancy, ensuring access to prenatal care, and reducing the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.\nEconomic benefits: Family planning can have economic benefits by reducing the financial burden of caring for a large family, allowing women to participate in the workforce, and increasing access to education and resources for families.\nEnvironmental benefits: Family planning can also have positive environmental benefits by reducing population growth and decreasing the strain on natural resources in certain regions.\nImproved quality of life: Family planning allows people to make informed choices about their reproductive health, which can improve their overall quality of life and well-being."

    "text": "Definition\nMigration represents the spatial population dynamics. Different types of migration exert specific health effects on the population.\nMigration is harder to define than the other demographic growth processes, mortality and fertility. Not all moves across geographic boundaries are migrations, since not all of them involve changing residence (that is, reaffiliation with a new population).\nThe voluntary migration, both individual and mass, that has been so prominent in modern Western history is unusual in the overall picture. Patterns of migration have shifted rapidly in the modern period and probably will continue to do so. Temporary labor migrations have grown to significantly outnumber permanent migrations. Former migration streams from more-developed countries to less-developed countries have reversed. Conflicts, increasingly within less-developed regions, have increased the numbers of people forced to migrate as refugees.\nPeople migrate for a variety of reasons, of course, but there are regularities. Differential rates relate to stage in the life cycle (age), employment status, ethnic identity, gender, and so on. Young adults entering the labor force and their offspring are the most likely to move. The most general model for interpreting migratory motivation is one that features a place of origin and a place of destination, each with attractive pull and unattractive push qualities, separated by a series of intervening obstacles. These empirical generalizations about migration have given rise to several modern migration theories which increasingly reflect the complexity of migration."

In the absence of such signs, the fetus is designated as “dead” (foetus mortus, stillbirth).\n“Abortion” is the loss or termination of a pregnancy before the fetus(es) meet the specified criteria for birth.\n\nVoluntary abortion - the voluntary termination of a pregnancy.\nSpontaneous abortion - the termination of pregnancy by the expulsion of the embryo/fetus before 25 gestational weeks or less than 700 grams.\nThe therapeutic termination of pregnancy (TToP) is an induced abortion following a diagnosis of medical necessity. TToP is carried out to avoid the risk of substantial harm to the mother or in cases of fetal unviability\nCriminal abortion is a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy by a person without the necessary skills or in an environment without minimal medical standards, or both. Criminal abortion is a crime regardless of the pregnant woman’s desire.\n\nPremature birth - Before 37 gestational weeks (less than 259 days).\nNeonatal period - The neonatal period begins from the moment of birth and ends after 28 full days after birth.\nPerinatal period - The perinatal period begins from the 25th full week of intrauterine life of the fetus and ends after 6 full days after birth.\nPostnatal period - From the 29th day until the end of the first year.\n\n\nIndicators\n\nCrude Birth Rate: The birth rate is the ratio of the number of live births to the average population during the same year. It is calculated per thousand and shows the number of live births per 1,000 people in the population.\n\nBirth rate is positively correlated with public health. High birth rates create a “potential” for an active population, reducing the burden of age-related diseases. In Bulgaria for 2023, the birth rate coefficient is 8.9 per 1000 people.\nAssessment of birth rates is done on a 3-degree scale:\n\nLow up to 15‰\nAverage 15-25‰\nHigh above 25‰\n\n\nFertility\n\nTotal Fertility Rate: It shows the average number of children (boys and girls) that a woman would give birth to during her entire reproductive period (from 15 to 49 years).\nNet Reproduction Rate: It is the ratio of the number of women giving birth in a year to the number of girls born to them in the same year, taking into account mortality. The NRR estimates the number of daughters who will live to replace their mothers in the future, thereby measuring the replacement of one generation by another. It allows for mortality between birth and the age of the mother at the time of bearing the child. Thus it defines replacement in terms of the numbers of daughters living to their mothers’ ages at confinement:\n\nNRR = 1, signifies exact replacement, or one daughter per woman: women are bearing just sufficient daughters to replace themselves in the future. The replacement level is always an NRR of 1, irrespective of whether the population has high or low mortality.\nNRR &lt; 1, denotes below-replacement fertility, where there are fewer daughters to succeed their mothers’ generation. Any value less than one means that the population is not replacing itself.\nNRR &gt; 1, indicates above-replacement fertility - the future generation of potential mothers will be larger than the one that produced them."

    "section": "Factors for Birth Rate",
    "text": "Factors for Birth Rate\nThe level of birth rate and the nature of population reproduction are determined by the size of the reproductive cohorts and their fertility. In the period before the so-called demographic transition, when natural fertility dominates, the birth rate level is almost entirely determined by the size of the reproductive cohorts. Later, with the onset of demographic transition, as fertility levels move away from natural fertility due to the beginning of family planning, the influence of reproductive cohorts weakens, and the birth rate is primarily determined by fertility levels.\n\nBiological Determinants:\n\nOnset of menarche and menopause – Earlier onset of menarche is associated with acceleration. However, this phenomenon leads to an earlier onset of menopause, and due to educational needs and career development of women during the early periods of their fertile life, this results in fewer opportunities to have more children in the shorter active fertile period.\nFrequency of ovulation – The more frequent ovulation is observed, the higher the likelihood of conception. However, due to limited ovarian reserve, more frequent ovulation can lead to premature depletion of a woman’s fertility and an earlier onset of menopause.\nAge during the reproductive period – The older the woman at the time of the first child’s birth, the lower the chance she will have more children.\nSpontaneous abortions or intrauterine death – A higher frequency of spontaneous abortions or intrauterine death leads to fewer live births and negatively affects fertility.\nUnwanted infertility – Unwanted infertility (due to disease) – Despite a couple’s desire to have children, if one or both partners are infertile, this becomes impossible or very difficult to achieve (with assisted reproduction methods). At a population level, the more widespread diseases that lead to infertility, the lower the fertility rate.\n\nBehavioral Determinants:\n\nMarriage rate and frequency of sexual contacts – A higher frequency of marriage and sexual contacts leads to a higher likelihood of conception.\nUse of contraception – The use of contraception results in fewer children.\nVoluntary sterilization – Cultural and individual preferences for sterilization, combined with the legal possibility for such without medical indications, reduces fertility. In Bulgaria, voluntary sterilization without medical indications is NOT allowed.\nSocial and religious beliefs and attitudes toward voluntary abortion.\nDuration of breastfeeding – Breastfeeding leads to a lower likelihood of conceiving the next child due to hormonal stimulation (it is not an absolute contraceptive!). The longer the breastfeeding period, the lower the probability of conception for the next child.\nWomen’s labor engagement.\nWomen’s education – With higher educational levels, the average number of live births decreases.\n\nSocial, Cultural, Economic, and Political Determinants:\n\nTradition, values, the number of siblings in the family;\nState policy (pro-natalist or anti-natalist);\nAvailability and accessibility of family planning;\nEconomic prosperity (economic paradox - fertility decreases with increasing economic prosperity);\nPoverty;\nChild mortality rate;\nUrbanization."

    "text": "Birth and Death Registration\n\nBirth:\n\nThe birth certificate is an official written document in which the event of birth is registered by the civil status officer according to the Civil Registration Act. The birth certificate is a copy used for administrative purposes.\nThe birth certificate is issued at the municipality or town hall of the place where the person was born, based on a birth notification issued by a competent medical professional.\nWhen a child is born, it is recorded in the hospital register. The birth notification is sent by the hospital to the civil status office in the municipality within seven days.\nA written notification of the birth of a stillborn child must be provided no later than 24 hours after the birth. The birth certificate for a stillborn child is issued no later than 48 hours after birth. If a child is born alive but dies before a birth certificate is issued, both a birth and a death certificate are prepared simultaneously.\nFor each live-born child, the first electronic health record in the National Health Information System is the birth information. This information is entered, with an electronic signature from the doctor who performed the delivery, within 24 hours after birth.\n\nDeath:\n\nThe death certificate is issued based on the death notification no later than 48 hours after death occurs.\nDeath occurring outside a healthcare facility is established by a doctor, or if a doctor is unavailable, by a paramedic.\nThe death is certified and entered in the citizen’s electronic health record in the National Health Information System. After this event, the record becomes “inactive,” and the electronic health record is kept for fifty years from that date. The doctor who established the death enters this event in the National Health Information System within 24 hours with an electronic signature.\nThe doctor (or paramedic) who confirms the death fills out the death notification in three copies:\n\nThe first copy is sent to the civil status officer in the municipality or town where the event occurred.\nThe second copy is sent to the relevant regional health inspection within two months of its issuance.\nThe third copy remains with the doctor/health facility. If death was confirmed in a healthcare facility, the copy is stored in a designated register within the healthcare facility.\n\nDeath from permanent and irreversible cessation of circulation and respiration is determined by a physical examination that checks for the permanent absence of any of the following signs:\n\nPalpable absence of pulse in both carotid and femoral arteries;\nAuscultatory absence of heart activity;\nAbsence of respiratory movements of the diaphragm and chest, observed visually;\nAbsence of breathing upon auscultation of the chest bilaterally.\nTo confirm the absence of electrical heart activity, an electrocardiogram (ECG) may be used. An ECG alone is not sufficient to establish death.\n\nThe general practitioner (GP) issues the death notification when:\n\nThe death occurred less than 48 hours ago;\nThe cause of death is a disease (non-violent);\nIf the deceased is identified and has identity documents;\nIf the doctor knows the cause of death;\nIf the doctor personally visits the place where the person died and ensures through a careful external examination of the head, body, and limbs that there are no signs of violence (mechanical, chemical, thermal, etc.);\nIf there are no signs that death occurred following recent trauma, such as an accident, workplace injury, beating, household accident, etc.\n\nAccording to the ICD, the causes of death to be entered are all diseases, pathological conditions, or injuries that led to or contributed to death, as well as the circumstances of the accident or violence that caused the fatal injury (see table Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Arrangement of causes of death according to ICD requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of Death\nDuration of Illness\n\n\n\n\nDisease or pathological condition directly leading to death\nIa\n\n\nPre-existing complications and conditions leading to the above cause\nIb\n\n\nUnderlying cause of death (disease)\nIc\n\n\nOther significant accompanying conditions\nII"

    "section": "Chapter I",
    "text": "Chapter I\nChapter one of the Health Act lays the foundation for the national system of health care by outlining general provisions, defining health establishments, establishing state health control mechanisms, addressing health information and documentation, and introducing the National Health Information System.\n\nSection I. General Provisions\nThe General Provisions, establishes that this Act governs public relations concerning the preservation of citizens’ health. It declares that the preservation of citizens’ health as a state of complete physical, psychic, and social welfare is a national priority guaranteed by the state. This guarantee is implemented through several key principles, including equality in using health services, providing accessible and qualitative health care with priority of health promotion and disease prevention, special health protection for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, new mothers, disabled, and mentally disordered people, and state participation in financing activities aimed at preserving citizens’ health.\nThe Minister of Health is required to present an annual report on the health status of citizens and the fulfillment of the National Health Strategy to the National Assembly three months before the start of the budget year. Furthermore, the Minister of Health approves the allocation of state budget subsidies for activities covered by this Act, with certain exceptions for medical and dental practice and pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nSection II. Health Establishments\nSection II defines health establishments, outlining that these are establishments where medical and non-medical specialists carry out activities related to the preservation and building-up of citizens’ health. Specifically, the Act lists several types of health establishments, including national centers for public health, the National Expert Medical Commission (NEMC), health consulting rooms (at schools), and optics. Pharmacies are also considered health establishments, but their status and activities are governed by the Medicinal Products In The Human Medicine Act.\n\nThe national centers for public health problems are tasked with activities such as studies, assessments, expertise, analyses, and prognoses in public health, prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics, organizing and coordinating medical care during disasters, risk assessment of environmental factors on health, laboratory tests and expertise, protection against ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, health promotion and disease prevention, expert assistance to regional health inspections, planning and implementing scientific activities, state health control in legally stipulated cases, and collecting and analyzing health information.\nOptics are defined by their activities, which include health consultations for sight problems by qualified physicians, undertaking measures for sight correction prescribed by a physician, and the making and sale of eyeglasses and optical materials.\n\n\n\nSection III: State Health Control\nSection III addresses state health control, stating that it is carried out to preserve the health of citizens throughout the Republic of Bulgaria. The bodies responsible for state health control are the chief health inspector of the Republic of Bulgaria, the regional health inspections, and the National Centre for radiobiology and radiation protection (NCRRP). The chief state health inspector organizes and manages state health control activities, health promotion and integrated disease prevention, and prophylactic and anti-epidemic measures during calamities and accidents. The chief state health inspector also has the authority to issue obligatory prescriptions for addressing non-compliance with health requirements, to propose the rejection of acceptance of public purpose constructions with essential violations of standards, and to place certifying signs in specific cases.\n\n\nSection IV. Health Information and Documentation\nSection V focuses on health information and documentation, defining health information as personal data related to health status, physical and psychological development, as well as information in medical prescriptions, records, certificates, and other medical documentation. Medical and health establishments, regional health inspections, physicians, dentists, pharmacists, other medical specialists, and non-medical specialists working in the national health system are responsible for gathering, processing, using, and storing health information. The forms, content, terms, and order of processing, using, and storing medical documentation and for exchanging medical statistical information are determined by ordinances of the Minister of Health.\nHealth information can be submitted to third parties under specific circumstances, such as for continued therapy, danger to others, identification of a deceased person, state health control needs for epidemic prevention, medical expertise and public insurance, medical statistics or research (with anonymized data), and the needs of the Ministry of Health, National Centre for Health Information, NHIF, regional health inspections, and the National Institute of Statistics. The submission of information generally requires notification of the concerned person. All entities handling health information are obligated to protect it against unauthorized access. Patients have the right to access their health information, including copies of medical certificates, and can authorize another person to review their medical certificates. Heirs and close relatives of a deceased patient also have the right to review the decedent’s medical file and obtain copies of medical certificates. Medical professionals are prohibited from disclosing patient information obtained during their official duties.\n\n\nSection V. National Health Information System\nSection VI introduces the National Health Information System (NHIS), established, administered, and maintained by the Ministry of Health. This system is based on principles of timeliness and accuracy of data, providing a suitable data exchange environment, ensuring regulated access in compliance with the law, and ensuring interoperability and information security. The system gathers, processes, and stores information on various aspects of health care. For the needs of this system, data from the Population Register is provided free of charge. Medical and healthcare establishments are required to submit information to the Ministry of Health for the creation and maintenance of electronic health records, with the type, manner, conditions, and procedure for providing this information to be determined by an ordinance of the Minister of Health. Citizens have the right to free access to their electronic health records within the National Health Information System, and medical and health establishments, the National Health Insurance Fund, insurance companies, and state bodies have access in connection with their functions or as provided by law. However, access to electronic health records for these entities is generally allowed only after explicit written consent."

    "text": "Chapter II\nChapter two of the Health Act details the activities aimed at the preservation of the health of citizens, encompassing a wide range of public health responsibilities and regulations.\n\nSection I. General Provisions\nSection I, General Provisions, establishes that state bodies and institutions are responsible for planning, developing, and conducting policies directed towards preserving citizen health by ensuring a healthy living environment, promoting education on a healthy lifestyle, and implementing health prophylactics. Municipalities can be assisted by health mediators in carrying out policies related to health prophylaxis, and doctors may also receive assistance in connection with the medical assistance they provide. Corporate bodies and individuals are obligated to adhere to established health requirements in their operations.\n\n\nSection II. Ensuring of healthy living environment\nSection II outlines the health requirements for sites with public designation and for activities of importance for human health. The Minister of Health manages the national system for analyzing, assessing, and controlling noise in urbanized areas and public buildings, as well as pollutants in drinking water. The Minister also analyzes and assesses environmental health factors at a national level in the annual report and proposes measures to limit their harmful impact. Individuals and legal entities intending to operate sites with public designation, introduce new activities, or change the purpose of existing ones, where these could affect citizens’ health, must notify the territorial bodies of the state health control. Within one month of notification, these bodies conduct checks for compliance with health requirements. Regional health inspections create and maintain public registers of sites with public designation, according to an ordinance by the Minister of Health.\nThis section also concerns the issuance of health certificates. Upon request from interested parties, the chief state health inspector issues health certificates for the export of domestically manufactured products and goods of importance for human health, certifying their compliance with national legislation and free distribution within the country. Applicants must submit a request indicating their details, the destination country, the justification for the certificate, and specific information for cosmetic products, such as the European Commission notification reference.\n\n\nSection III. State Health Control over Cosmetic Products\nSection III addresses state health control over cosmetic products. Cosmetic products placed on the market are considered safe if they comply with good manufacturing practices, have undergone safety assessments, meet the requirements for the product information file (accessible in Bulgarian if kept in Bulgaria), adhere to restrictions for specific substances, meet labeling requirements (with certain information also displayed in Bulgarian), comply with product claim regulations, and meet requirements for public access to information.\n\n\nSection IV. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention\nSection IV focuses on activities for restricting the use of tobacco and related products, the abuse of alcohol, and preventing the use of narcotic substances. The state implements promotional and prophylactic activities and ensures access to medical help and social protection for affected individuals. These activities are carried out through national programs aimed at restricting the use of tobacco and related products, alcohol abuse, and preventing narcotic substance use, as well as prohibiting the use of nitrous oxide (paradise gas) by individuals under 18. The use of nitrous oxide in closed public places is also prohibited, except for medical purposes and specific cases under the Foodstuffs Act.\n\n\nSection V. Supervision of Infectious Diseases\nSection V deals with the supervision of infectious diseases. Border health control is implemented when necessary to protect the country from the spread of particularly dangerous infectious diseases. Prophylactic measures against infectious diseases include mandatory immunizations included in the national immunization calendar, purposed immunizations upon special indications, and recommended immunizations, with specific requirements determined by an ordinance of the Minister of Health. In extraordinary epidemic situations or significant reductions in immunization coverage, the Minister of Health can order additional anti-epidemic measures, which medical and health establishments, regardless of ownership, are obligated to implement. Individuals with infectious diseases, their contacts, and carriers are subject to registration, mandatory announcement, and accounting, with the specific diseases and procedures defined by an ordinance of the Minister of Health. National plans are developed to limit the spread of contagious diseases, defining specific actions, indicators, criteria, and timelines for introducing and revoking temporary anti-epidemic measures.\n\n\nSection VI. Protection from Ionizing Radiation\nSection VI addresses protection from the impact of ionizing radiation. Protection of individuals from ionizing radiation is implemented by observing radiation protection principles, including control of working and living environment factors, medical observation of exposed workers, and informing the public about radiation levels.\nActivities involving sources of ionizing radiation require registration or permission from the Minister of Health or authorized bodies, with specific documentation requirements including information about the applicant, activities, measuring instruments, and qualified personnel for quality testing of medical radiological equipment.\n\n\nSection VII. Protection from Asbestos\nSection VII concerns protection against the harmful influence of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials.

    "section": "Chapter III",
    "text": "Chapter III\n\nSection I. Accessibility and quality of the medical care\nMedical care in Bulgaria follows approved scientific and practical methods. It is regulated by medical standards and good practice rules. Every Bulgarian citizen has the right to accessible healthcare under the Health Insurance Act, ensuring timely, sufficient, and high-quality care with priority for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\nCertain medical services are provided outside the mandatory health insurance system, including emergency aid, intensive treatment for uninsured individuals, maternity care, psychiatric care, organ transplants, and epidemic prevention. The state also funds specific treatments for uninsured persons, such as mental health support and methadone programs. Additionally, children and individuals with rare conditions receive continued treatment funding under specific regulations.\nBulgarian citizens may seek medical treatment abroad if no suitable options exist domestically, with state funding under defined conditions. Public health initiatives, immunizations, and epidemic control measures are fully covered by the state. Municipalities may also support healthcare for low-income and unemployed residents.\nForeigners with long-term or permanent residency, as well as refugees and individuals under temporary protection, receive medical care under the same conditions as Bulgarian citizens. Short-term visitors and transit passengers must cover their medical expenses unless covered by international agreements. European Union nationals receive healthcare at the same standards and pricing as Bulgarian citizens, ensuring equal access to medical services.\n\n\nSection II. Rights and obligations of the patient\nA patient is any individual who seeks or receives medical care. Registration as a patient occurs with informed consent, except in specific cases defined by law. Medical assistance is provided without discrimination based on age, gender, origin, language, race, political beliefs, education, culture, sexual orientation, social or material status, or the type and cause of an illness.\nPatients are entitled to respect for their civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and religious rights. They should receive care within their community and have access to high-quality healthcare. They can seek multiple medical opinions regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Their health data must be protected, and they have the right to clear and understandable information about their health status and treatment options. Preventive care and rehabilitation must be available, alongside reliable and safe diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Efforts should be made to minimize pain and suffering during treatment. Patients also have the right to access up-to-date treatment methods and review their medical records.\nDuring hospitalization, patients may be visited by their personal doctor and the specialist responsible for their admission. They can receive or refuse visits and have access to services from a psychotherapist, lawyer, or clergyman. Education and engagement in activities that meet social, religious, and cultural needs should be available. Patients must be informed about the costs of medical services, treatments, and medications.\nThe Public Council of Patient’s Rights operates under the Ministry of Health, comprising representatives from patient rights organizations, disability organizations, and healthcare professionals. This council monitors patient rights, analyzes related activities, prepares annual reports, and proposes amendments to relevant regulations. It also reviews and comments on draft laws concerning patient rights.\nOrganizations that protect patient rights must be non-profit entities working for the benefit of all patients, independent of specific illnesses. These organizations must be nationally representative and have regional structures. The government and relevant state authorities support these organizations, granting them access to legislative drafts and updates. They may report violations of patient rights and participate in advisory bodies and commissions.\nMedical procedures require informed consent from the patient. For minors or individuals with limited legal capacity, a parent or guardian must also provide consent. However, parental consent is not required for certain preventive healthcare services for individuals under 16. In cases where a minor is placed outside their family by court order and parental consent cannot be obtained in time, a designated caregiver or social services representative provides consent.\nMedical professionals must provide patients with detailed information regarding their diagnosis, the nature and goals of treatment, available alternatives, potential risks, side effects, and expected outcomes. This information must be presented in a timely and understandable manner, allowing patients to make informed decisions. For high-risk procedures such as surgeries or invasive treatments, consent must be given in writing. In emergencies where the patient cannot provide consent, life-saving treatment may proceed without it.\nPatients can refuse medical care at any time. Such refusal must be documented in medical records. If a patient is unable to provide written confirmation of their refusal, a doctor and a witness must certify it. In cases where refusal poses a direct threat to life, the medical institution’s chief administrator may authorize life-saving treatment. Patients can withdraw their refusal at any time without legal repercussions for medical professionals.\nMedical care may only be provided against a patient’s will in cases specifically established by law. Physicians must keep patients informed about their health status, treatment needs, risks, diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives, and the professionals involved in their care. Patients have the right to decline certain information unless their health condition poses a risk to others.\nThese rights and responsibilities ensure a balance between patient autonomy and the duty of medical professionals to provide appropriate care while maintaining ethical and legal standards in healthcare.\n\n\nSection III. Medical care upon emergency status\nThe state of Bulgaria organizes and finances a system to provide medical care during emergencies. An emergency is defined as an acute or sudden change in a person’s condition that requires immediate medical attention. The primary goals of emergency medical care are to prevent death, severe or irreversible damage to vital organs and systems, and complications during childbirth that threaten the health and life of the mother or fetus.\nIn the event of an emergency, any person present at the scene is required to inform the nearest emergency medical center, another medical establishment, or the police. Medical establishments are obligated to provide the necessary medical care to patients in emergency situations, regardless of their citizenship, address, or health insurance status. If a medical establishment cannot provide the required care, the patient should be transferred to the nearest facility that can, provided the patient’s condition allows for safe transport. All relevant medical documents must accompany the patient during the transfer.\nTransporting a patient is not permitted if it poses an unjustifiably high risk to their health and life.\n\n\nSection IV. Medical expertise\nMedical expertise in Bulgaria is organized and managed by the Minister of Health and the regional health inspections. It is implemented to establish temporary work inability, determine the type and degree of disability for children up to 16 years of age, and assess the degree of permanently reduced ability to work for individuals of active working age. This expertise also confirms professional diseases.\nDuring temporary work inability examinations, an assessment is made to determine if the individual’s health condition permits them to appear before investigation or judicial authorities if necessary. The type and degree of disability and the degree of permanently reduced ability to work are determined in percentage relative to the abilities of a healthy person. For individuals eligible for a pension based on insured years of service and age, the type and degree of disability are determined for life, with re-certification possible upon request.\nThe principles and criteria for medical expertise, the process for establishing temporary work inability, and the determination of disability and reduced ability to work are outlined in an ordinance by the Council of Ministers. The term of the decision for the degree of permanently reduced work ability is determined based on the characteristics of the damage, its development dynamics, and recovery possibilities. In cases of definitive conditions with no possibility of recovery, the degree is determined for life.\nThe Regional Health Inspectorate notifies individuals of the need for re-certification before the expiry of their current term. If there is a delay in the medical examination, the validity of the last issued expert decision is extended until a new decision is issued. Information about delays and scheduled re-certification dates is communicated to relevant bodies and organizations.\nThe National Council in Medical Expertise, created at the Council of Ministers, develops national health policy statements related to medical expertise, coordinates activities between state bodies, analyzes the status of medical expertise, and proposes amendments to relevant regulations. The council includes representatives from various ministries and health organizations.\nMedical expertise includes assessments of temporary work inability, the type and degree of disability, and permanently reduced ability to work. These assessments are conducted by doctors, medical consultative commissions (MCC), territorial expert medical commissions (TEMC), and the National Expert Medical Commission (NEMC). The expertise of the type and degree of disability for children up to 16 years of age involves specialists in children’s diseases.\nThe medical consultative commissions are established in medical establishments and include at least two permanent members. The territorial expert medical commissions are structural units of the medical establishments where they are opened. Doctors working in TEMC and NEMC must have recognized specialties and at least five years of medical practice.\nThe National Expert Medical Commission maintains an information database for all individuals who have undergone medical expertise to establish permanently reduced working capacity or disability. This database collects, processes, stores, and analyzes data for planning activities related to education, medical and social rehabilitation, employment, and assessing the health status of the population.\nControl over medical expertise is implemented by the National Centre for Medical Expertise, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Labour and Social Policy, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), the National Social Security Institute (NSSI), regional councils, and regional health inspections. Appeals and objections to decisions made by medical expertise bodies can be submitted within specific timeframes to higher bodies or administrative courts.\nThe decisions of medical expertise bodies are binding for all individuals, bodies, and organizations in the country once the appeal process is exhausted.\n\n\nSection V.

    "text": "Chapter IV\n\nSection I. Health protection of children\nThe state, municipalities, corporate bodies, and individuals in Bulgaria are responsible for creating conditions that ensure a healthy living environment and normal physical and psychological development for children. To support families in raising children up to three years of age and to ensure their normal development, creches and children’s kitchens are established. Creches are organizationally detached structures where medical and other specialists care for, train, and educate children from three months to three years of age. Children’s kitchens are also organizationally detached structures where specialists prepare, preserve, and provide food for children up to three years of age. The requirements for the structure and activities of creches and children’s kitchens, as well as the norms for healthy feeding of children, are determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health.\nCreches and children’s kitchens can be created by municipalities, individuals, and corporate bodies. Municipal creches and children’s kitchens are established, transformed, and closed by the order of the mayor of the municipality, with the decision of the municipal council and the consent of the director of the corresponding regional health inspection. The maintenance of children in municipal creches and the activities of municipal children’s kitchens are supported by the respective municipal budget. Parents and guardians pay fees for receiving children’s food from municipal children’s kitchens, with the amounts determined by the municipal council in compliance with the Local Taxes and Fees Act. The state provides funds to parents to compensate for costs related to raising, upbringing, and educating children who were not accepted due to lack of places in municipal nurseries or nursery groups in municipal and state kindergartens.\nHealth offices in kindergartens and schools provide medical services, including first aid, support for children with chronic diseases, health promotion and prevention, and activities to prevent and limit the spread of contagious and parasitic diseases. They also participate in organizing recreation, tourism, and sports activities for children and students, and implement health education programs. These activities are carried out by medical doctors and other medical specialists with appropriate qualifications, under employment contracts with the mayor of the respective municipality or the person who established a private kindergarten or school. The financing of health offices in municipal and state schools and kindergartens is provided by municipal budgets, while private kindergartens and schools are financed by their owners. The regional health inspection controls the activities carried out by health offices.\nSpecialists from health offices are required to notify parents, guardians, or trustees and the general practice doctor of the child about any newly discovered disease or deviation in the child’s development. Students receive training on personal hygiene, healthy feeding, living environment, lifestyle, protection from infectious diseases, health risks associated with tobacco, alcohol, and narcotic substances, sexual conduct, protection from sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, and first aid. The training of lecturers on these issues is organized by the Minister of Education and Science, in coordination with the Minister of Health. School boards of trustees organize measures to inform parents about children’s health problems.\nProphylactic medical and dental aid is provided to children and students in creches, kindergartens, schools, and social and integrated health and social services for residential care. This includes annual examinations or prophylactic medical and dental examinations, with the conditions and order for conducting these examinations determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. These activities are financed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).\nMedical specialists are required to notify the Directorate “Social Support” of any child at risk of being left in a medical establishment, including cases where the mother’s identity documents are missing, or in cases of single mothers, mothers with many children, or mothers with serious or multiple diseases. They must also notify the Ministry of Interior and the Directorate “Social Support” of any child admitted to a medical establishment or health consulting room who is a victim of harassment.\n\n\nSection II. Reproductive health\nThe state ensures the health protection of reproductive health through various measures. These include promoting and providing consultations for preserving reproductive health for children and individuals of reproductive age, ensuring access to specialized consultative assistance on reproductive health and family planning, and offering prophylactics and treatment for sterility. Additionally, specialized information, consultations, prophylactics, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS are provided, along with prophylactics, treatment, and dispensary observation for individuals with malignant diseases of the reproductive system. Everyone has the right to information and freedom of decision regarding their reproductive health.\nFor ensuring risk-free motherhood, every woman has the right to access health activities aimed at ensuring optimal health for both the woman and the fetus from the onset of pregnancy until the child is 42 days old. These health activities include promoting the health of the woman and the fetus, preventing the risk of abortion and premature birth, training in feeding and caring for the newborn, and active medical observation of the pregnancy on a dispensary basis by primary and specialized off-hospital care establishments. Prenatal diagnostics and prophylactics of genetic and other diseases are provided under conditions determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. Additionally, optimal living environments for women in childbed and newborns are ensured, along with dispensary observation and health care for the woman in childbed and the child. Pregnant women have free access to medical establishments for specialized off-hospital care and hospital care in cases threatening the pregnancy. They also have the right to choose the medical establishment for childbirth.\nThe conditions and order for implementing artificial abortion and the criteria for fetal viability are determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. This ordinance also outlines the obligations of medical specialists in cases of suspected abortion performed outside the conditions and order of the Act. Permanent divesting of the ability for reproduction is implemented under conditions and by order determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health.\n\n\nSection III. Assisted reproduction\nAssisted reproduction is applied when the reproductive functions of a man or woman cannot be accomplished naturally. It is implemented after receiving written informed consent from the individuals wishing to create a generation. Medical investigations are conducted to guarantee the health of the offspring. Assisted reproduction follows a medical standard adopted by an ordinance from the Minister of Health.\nAssisted reproduction includes activities such as using medical methods for fertilizing the ovum inside or outside the woman’s body, procuring, processing, labeling, transporting, and storing ova, spermatozoids, and zygotes, and placing an ovum in the body of the same or another woman. Donor ova can be used if the donor meets specific criteria, provides written consent certified by a notary, and is informed of the risks. The donor’s physical and psychological health must be confirmed by a commission of at least three physicians.\nMedical establishments performing assisted reproduction must prepare annual reports on their activities and present them to the Executive Agency for Medical Supervision. It is prohibited to offer or receive material profit for donating ova or spermatozoids.\nAssisted reproduction and the provision, use, and storage of human ova, spermatozoids, and zygotes are performed by medical establishments with the appropriate permissions and certifications. The Minister of Health can stop or withdraw permissions if the establishments fail to meet the medical standards. Medical establishments must maintain registers of all activities related to assisted reproduction and ensure the confidentiality of donor and recipient information.\nThe Executive Agency for Medical Supervision registers, analyzes, and controls assisted reproduction activities, ensuring quality and safety. It also maintains public and internal office registers, with data kept for 30 years. Medical establishments must notify the agency of any serious adverse reactions or incidents and have systems in place for immediate action.\nLabeling and tracing of ova, spermatozoids, and zygotes are mandatory, and the use of assisted reproduction techniques for sex selection or genetic modification is prohibited, except for preventing inherited diseases. Reproductive cloning and genome modification for non-prophylactic or non-healing purposes are also prohibited. Discrimination based on a person’s genome is not allowed.\n\n\nSection IV. Genetic health and genetic investigations\nThe preservation of genetic health in Bulgaria is ensured through various health activities. These activities include prophylactic and diagnostic investigations to identify and classify genetic diseases, a dispensary system for individuals at increased risk of genetic diseases, treatment of inherited diseases, congenital anomalies, and predispositions, establishing inherited characteristics and parentage, and preserving genetic information.\nProphylactic genetic investigations are conducted to determine the risk of genetic diseases in offspring, identify clinically healthy carriers of genetic deviations, and diagnose inherited and other diseases before and during pregnancy and after childbirth. These investigations are carried out under medical supervision and include proving genetic deviations in parents, establishing predispositions to genetic diseases, identifying genetic deviations caused by lifestyle or environmental factors, and diagnosing genetic diseases at their clinical manifestation.\nNational health programs conduct targeted investigations to establish the type and frequency of genetic deviations and determine the genetic fund. Genetic investigations and the collection of biological material for medical or scientific purposes require written informed consent from the individuals being investigated. For children, individuals with mental disorders, and those under guardianship, permission from the medical ethics commission at the respective medical establishment is also required. The results of genetic investigations and screenings cannot be used as a basis for discrimination, and data about an individual’s genome is considered personal data that cannot be shared with employers, health insurance organizations, or insurance companies.\nGenetic investigations for medical or scientific purposes are conducted by accredited genetic laboratories at medical establishments for hospital and outpatient care, as well as independent laboratories. The Minister of Health designates a National Genetic Laboratory, which provides methodological guidance and control over genetic laboratories and maintains a national genetic register. The conditions and procedures for the National Genetic Laboratory and the register are determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health.\nMedical establishments conducting genetic investigations must report their activities and results to the National Genetic Laboratory monthly and maintain an official register of their investigations. These laboratories can also create DNA banks for scientific and medical purposes, which must be registered with the Ministry of Health within seven days.\nA national register of patients with rare diseases is established to determine the type and frequency of rare diseases and to plan and provide preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic activities related to these diseases. The terms, conditions, and procedures for registering rare diseases and the criteria for health care establishments wishing to participate in European reference networks are determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. This ordinance also outlines the establishment, designation, and functioning of rare diseases expert centers and reference networks."

    "text": "Chapter V\n\nSection I. Protection of the psychic health\nThe state, municipalities, and non-government organizations in Bulgaria organize activities to protect mental health through a comprehensive system of care and support. This includes ensuring accessible and high-quality medical care for persons with mental disorders, protecting mental health in risk groups (including children, students, elderly people, and institutionalized individuals), and implementing active prevention of mental disorders.\nThe system emphasizes specialized continuing education for mental health professionals, training programs for educators and medical practitioners, and scientific research aimed at strengthening mental health. Public awareness initiatives about mental health issues are also prioritized. Municipalities are responsible for providing psycho-social rehabilitation and support, including housing assistance for individuals with mental disorders.\nPersons requiring special mental health care include those with serious mental disorders (such as psychosis or severe personality disorders), individuals with moderate to severe mental disabilities or dementia, and those with other mental function disorders that affect their ability to live independently. All individuals with mental disorders are entitled to treatment and care equal to that provided for other medical conditions.\nTreatment of mental disorders follows key principles including minimal restriction of personal freedom, reduced institutional dependence, and priority for family and community-based care. The system promotes integration of psychiatric care with other medical services, emphasizes humanitarian approaches to treatment and social adaptation, and encourages self-help and mutual support networks.\nMental health services are provided through various medical establishments, including primary care facilities, specialized psychiatric care centers, mental health centers, and specialized hospital divisions. Treatment includes diagnostic investigations, medication, and psychotherapy, though surgical alterations to the central nervous system for psychological purposes are prohibited.\nFor patients who pose an immediate danger to themselves or others, temporary physical restriction measures may be applied under strict medical supervision for no longer than 6 hours. These measures must be documented and the patient kept under constant observation.\nLabor therapy is incorporated into psycho-social rehabilitation programs, with safeguards against exploitation and forced labor. Healthcare offices staffed by medical professionals are established in residential care facilities with more than 20 persons with mental disorders, providing ongoing medical observation and basic healthcare services.\nEmergency psychiatric care is provided through mental health centers and specialized medical facilities when a person’s behavior poses immediate danger. In cases requiring extended treatment, temporary accommodation can be arranged for up to 24 hours, with possible extension to 48 hours with judicial approval.\n\n\nSection II. Compulsory accommodation and treatment\nCompulsory accommodation and treatment may be required for individuals with serious mental disorders who, due to their condition, could pose a danger to themselves, their relatives, or society. This measure is implemented through a carefully regulated legal process that balances individual rights with public safety.\nThe decision for compulsory accommodation and treatment is made by the district court at the person’s address or, in emergency cases, by the court where the medical establishment is located. Treatment is provided in specialized psychiatric care facilities, mental health centers, or psychiatric divisions of multi-profile hospitals.\nThe legal process includes several key safeguards:\n\nThe person has the right to make objections and present evidence within 7 days of receiving notice\nCourt hearings must include a psychiatrist, legal defender, and prosecutor\nThe person must be personally interviewed unless their health condition prevents it\nA judicial-psychiatric assessment must be conducted within strict timeframes\nTreatment during assessment requires either emergency status or informed consent\n\nThe court determines:\n\nThe necessity of compulsory accommodation\nThe designated medical facility\nWhether the person can provide informed consent\nDuration and form of treatment (ambulatory or stationary)\nIf needed, appointment of a representative to provide informed consent\nTreatment orders are reviewed quarterly through judicial-psychiatric expertise. Compulsory treatment can be terminated early if conditions improve, upon request from the person, prosecutor, or medical establishment chief. The process ensures ongoing monitoring and the possibility of early release when appropriate.\n\nDecisions can be appealed within 7 days, with appeals generally staying the execution unless otherwise ordered. The regional court must rule on appeals within 7 days, with these decisions being final."

University hospitals are multi-profiled or specialized hospitals, determined by the Council of Ministers, where activities are carried out in clinical training of students and PhD students in medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, clinical training for students in subjects of professional direction Health Care, and postgraduate training of doctors, dentists, pharmacists, and specialists in health care.\nIt is permissible for another medical establishment for hospital care to perform its activity on the territory of a state or municipal medical establishment for hospital care, provided that the clinics, departments, and laboratories in the two medical establishments for hospital care carry out different medical activities.\nArticle 10 lists other medical establishments:\n\nCenter for Emergency Medical Care\nCenter for Transfusion Haematology\nMental Health Center\nSkin and Venereal Disease Center\nComplex Oncology Center\nHome for Medical and Social Care\nCenter for Complex Service of Disabled Children and Chronic Diseases\nHospice\nDialysis Center\nTissue Bank\n\n\n\nChapter III.\nThis chapter focuses on medical establishments that provide non-stationary (outpatient) care, detailing their functions, organization, and operational requirements.\nArticle 11 outlines the activities carried out in ambulatories for primary or specialized non-stationary care, where doctors or dental practitioners:\n\nCarry out:\n\nDiagnostics, treatment, rehabilitation, and care of patients\nConsultations\nProphylactics\nDispensarization\n\nPrescribe:\n\nLaboratory and other types of tests\nMedical activities and manipulations under their supervision and responsibility\nThe volume and type of home care and aid to patients\nMedical supplies, dressing materials, and medical instruments\n\nCarry out expertise of temporary incapacity\nProvide care and render medical aid for pregnancy and maternity\nObserve, control, and care for the physical and psychological development of persons under 18 years of age\nCarry out activities on health promotion and prophylactics, including prophylactic examinations and immunizations\nIssue documents related to their activity\nDirect patients for consultative and hospital care\n\nClinical testing of medicinal products may be carried out at a medical center, a medical-dental center, a dental center, and in individual and group practices for primary and specialized medical care. Doctors and dental practitioners in these ambulatories must treat patients in their homes when the patient’s condition requires it and hospitalize patients when treatment cannot be achieved in ambulatory conditions or at home. Dental practitioners with appropriate qualifications may carry out image diagnostics of patients’ teeth and jaws.\nArticle 12 states that the type of ambulatory is determined by the nature of the activity, the number and qualification of the doctors or dental practitioners, and the way of organization.\nArticle 13 specifies that individual practice for primary medical care is organized and carried out by a doctor with a recognized specialty in general medicine or by a doctor in dental medicine, who must be registered. Individual practice for specialized medical care is organized and carried out by a doctor with a recognized specialty other than general medicine or by a doctor in dental medicine with an acknowledged specialty, who must also be registered. These individuals can hire other persons according to the needs and volume of the medical activity. They must appoint deputies in cases of their absence, informing the regional health inspection and the regional health assurance fund. The deputy must have the respective legal capacity and be entered in the respective register. The conditions and order of substitution for absences over 10 days are settled by the contract for providing medical care with the regional health assurance fund.\nArticle 14 states that group practice for primary medical care is carried out by a trade company or cooperative founded by doctors with recognized specialties in general medicine or by doctors in dental medicine, which must be registered. Group practice for specialized medical care is carried out by a trade company or cooperative founded by doctors with the same recognized specialty other than general medicine or by doctors in dental medicine with the same acknowledged specialty, which must be registered. These individuals can also hire other persons according to the needs and volume of the medical activity.\nArticle 14a states that doctors admitted to training for specialization in general medicine are also entitled to organize and carry out an individual or group practice of primary medical care after registration, for a period not longer than the time limit for training for the specialty.\nArticle 15 allows individuals to conclude contracts for carrying out medical activity with doctor’s assistants and nurses (midwives) working in another populated area.\nArticle 16 defines a medical center or medical and dental center as a medical establishment providing non-stationary care, with at least three doctors and/or three dental practitioners with different acknowledged specialties. A dental center is a medical establishment in which at least three physicians in dental medicine of different acknowledged specialties provide primary and specialized non-stationary dental care. Medical centers, dental centers, and medical and dental centers are managed by a doctor or dental practitioner with an acknowledged specialty. The structure, activity, and internal order of the center are settled by regulations approved by the manager.\nArticle 17 defines a diagnostic and consultative center as a medical institution carrying out specialized outpatient care with at least 10 physicians with various acknowledged specialties. The center must be supplied with the necessary medical equipment and have at least one medical diagnostic laboratory and a unit for image diagnostics. The diagnostic and consultative center is managed by a doctor with an acknowledged specialty and qualification in health management or a master of economics and management with an acquired educational or scientific degree, subject, or passed education for raising qualification in the area of health management. The structure, activity, and internal order of the center are settled by regulations approved by the manager. Clinical trials of medicinal products may be carried out at the diagnostic and consultative center.\nArticle 17a allows medical, medical dental, and diagnostic consulting centers to establish units in which medical assistants, medical nurses, and midwives can provide obstetrical services and health care. The types of activities carried out in these units are determined in compliance with the Ordinance under Art. 7, par. 1 of the Act on the Professional Organizations of Nurses, Midwives and Associated Medical Specialists, Dental Technicians and Assistant-Pharmacists. The units are managed by persons having an educational and qualification degree of “Bachelor” in the subjects medical assistant, nurse, or “obstetrics” and a professional experience of not less than two years. The procedure of implementation of activities in the units is ruled in the Regulations for organization, operation, and in-order of the respective medical establishment.\nArticle 18 defines an independent medical and diagnostic laboratory as a medical establishment in which doctors, with the assistance of other specialists, carry out specialized medical tests in one or more medical subjects prescribed by another doctor or dental practitioner. Working in it must be at least one doctor with an acknowledged specialty in each of the directions of the laboratory activity. An independent medical technical laboratory is a medical establishment in which specialists with the respective education carry out specific technical activities and produce specialized medical products prescribed by a doctor or dental practitioner. The independent medical diagnostic laboratory is managed by a doctor with an acknowledged specialty in one of the directions of the laboratory activity. The independent medical technical laboratory is managed by a doctor, dental practitioner, or specialist on the profile of the laboratory. The requirements for carrying out the activities of the laboratories are determined by the relevant medical standards. The structure, activity, and internal rules of the laboratories are provided by Rules confirmed by the head of the laboratory.\n\n\nChapter IV.\nThis chapter details the functions, requirements, and classifications of medical establishments that provide inpatient healthcare services in Bulgaria.\nMedical establishments for hospital care are defined as facilities where doctors, assisted by other specialists and auxiliary personnel, carry out specialized healthcare activities. These activities include diagnosing and treating diseases that cannot be managed in outpatient settings, providing natal care, offering rehabilitation services, and conducting diagnostics and consultations requested by other medical professionals or establishments. They may also perform transplantation of organs, tissues and cells; collect, store, and supply blood and blood components; conduct clinical tests of medicinal products and medical devices; and engage in educational and scientific activities.\nFor a medical establishment to provide stationary care, it must operate in compliance with established medical standards and good practice rules, employ medical specialists under primary employment contracts, have technically sound medical equipment and facilities on its premises, and adhere to approved financial standards where applicable. These establishments must ensure uninterrupted 24-hour medical service in all medical specialties authorized in their operating permission, including emergency medical care.\nIn certain medical establishments for hospital care, consultative offices, medical-diagnostic and medical technical laboratories, and wards without beds may also provide outpatient care activities.\nThe legislation defines several types of hospitals based on their functions and the care they provide:\n\nHospitals for active treatment admit patients with acute diseases, traumas, aggravated chronic conditions, conditions requiring operative treatment in hospital conditions, and provide natal care. These facilities may also incorporate structures for continuous treatment and rehabilitation. Additionally, they can offer complex medical care for individuals with specific illnesses, disabled children, and those with chronic diseases. These complex care services may be organized functionally through the hospital’s structural units, especially for individuals with psychotic, skin, venereal, and oncological conditions.\nHospitals for continuous treatment serve individuals requiring long-term health recovery and those with chronic diseases needing care and maintenance of satisfactory physical and psychological condition.\nRehabilitation hospitals admit persons needing physical therapy, motor and psychological rehabilitation, and various therapeutic approaches including balneological, climatological, and thalassotherapy.\nHospitals for continuous treatment and rehabilitation combine the activities of both continuous treatment and rehabilitation facilities.\n\nThe law further categorizes hospitals as either multi-profile or specialized. A multi-profile hospital contains departments and clinics for at least two medical specialties. A specialized hospital focuses on a single medical or dental specialty but may include structures for surgery, therapeutic procedures, clinical diagnostics, and anesthesiology and intensive care as needed to support its specialized function.\nThe organization of complex care services in hospitals must be detailed in the facility’s rules of procedure, activity, and internal order. Any expansion of services to include continuous treatment, rehabilitation, or complex care requires obtaining official permission from the appropriate authorities.\nThis comprehensive framework ensures that hospital care in Bulgaria is delivered according to standardized approaches, with appropriate medical expertise and equipment, and with clear guidelines for different types of care based on patient needs.\n\n\nChapter V.\nThis chapter describes various specialized medical establishments that provide specific types of healthcare services in Bulgaria.\nThe Centre for Emergency Medical Care is a medical establishment where healthcare professionals render emergency medical assistance to sick and injured persons at various locations, including homes, accident sites, and during transportation to hospitals.\nThe Centre for Transfusion Haematology is dedicated to blood-related services, including taking blood and blood components, diagnosing, processing, storing, and providing blood and blood components, producing blood biological preparations, and carrying out transfusion supervision. These centers operate according to the requirements of both the Medical Establishments Act and the Blood, Blood Donation, and Blood Transfusion Act.\nThe Mental Health Centre focuses on psychiatric services, providing emergency psychiatric aid, diagnosis and treatment of persons with mental disorders, periodic monitoring and consultation of patients, psychotherapy and psycho-social rehabilitation, psychiatric and psychological expert activity, and maintaining a regional information system for individuals with mental disorders. These centers also conduct activities related to mental health promotion, prevention, public information, and research. The mental health center is structured to include reception-diagnostic units, emergency and mobile psychiatric aid units, active treatment facilities for persons with severe mental disorders, and rehabilitation and resocialization units. These centers may also provide social services as defined in the Social Support Act.\nThe Skin and Venereal Disease Centre specializes in diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitating individuals with dermatological conditions and sexually transmitted diseases. These centers monitor epidemiological indices for sexually transmissible infections, provide expert activities in sexual health, and conduct public education and research activities. The center includes specialized diagnosis and consultation offices, wards, and assistance units, with the possibility of having up to 10 accommodation places for diagnosis and treatment.\nThe Complex Oncology Centre is dedicated to cancer-related healthcare, including active search, diagnosis, and treatment of persons with oncological diseases, monitoring and registration of cancer patients, maintaining an information database for the National Cancer Registry, and conducting prevention and public information activities related to cancer. The center has a diagnostic and consultation block, a stationary block with departments for medical oncology, radiation treatment, and oncological surgery, a unit for registration and prevention of oncological diseases, and a pharmacy. These centers may also provide social services and palliative care.\nThe Home for Medical and Social Care provides continuous medical observation and specific care for persons with chronic diseases and those requiring specific home care due to chronic disabling conditions and medical-social problems. These establishments may also provide social services as outlined in the Social Support Act.\nThe Centre for Complex Service of Disabled Children and Children with Chronic Diseases supports families with disabled children and those with chronic diseases by providing early diagnostics, treatment, and rehabilitation. These centers offer continuous treatment and rehabilitation services, specialized home visits, and palliative care. They work in coordination with other medical establishments to ensure comprehensive care and may provide social services under the Social Support Act.\nThe Hospice provides palliative care for terminally ill patients, with the treatment activity managed by a medical specialist. Hospices qualifying as medical establishments may also provide social services.\nThe Dialysis Centre specializes in treatment, rehabilitation, and observation of patients with chronic kidney insufficiency. These centers are managed by doctors with recognized medical specialties and at least two years of practice in hemodialysis. Clinical trials of medicinal products can be conducted at dialysis centers under the Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act.\nThe Tissue Bank is a medical establishment where physicians take, study, label, treat, transport, store, and process organs, tissues, and cells for medical purposes. Tissue banks may take tissues and cells for implantation or processing, and organs only for processing.\nEach of these specialized medical establishments is required to have regulations governing their structure, activity, and internal operations, approved by the head of the establishment. Their medical activities are carried out in structural units that have defined levels of competence in compliance with established medical standards."

    "title": "Health legislation in Bulgaria - Comprehensive overview",
    "section": "Part three",
    "text": "Part three\n\nChapter VI.\nThis chapter outlines the framework for healthcare planning in Bulgaria through a system of health maps at regional and national levels, ensuring that medical services are distributed according to population needs across the country.\nThe National Health Map serves as the foundation for implementing Bulgaria’s healthcare policy by defining and planning the population’s needs for accessible outpatient and hospital medical care on a territorial basis. It is created by consolidating regional health maps, which are developed by specially appointed commissions in each region.\nEach regional commission is chaired by the regional governor and includes representatives from various healthcare stakeholders: regional health inspection, regional health insurance bank, professional medical organizations (Bulgarian Physicians’ Union, Bulgarian Dentists’ Union, Bulgarian Association of Healthcare Professionals), patient rights organizations, and municipal representatives. This diverse composition ensures that multiple perspectives inform healthcare planning.\nThe regional health maps are developed using standardized methods approved by the Minister of Health. The commissions must consider healthcare accessibility for populations living in remote areas and conduct comprehensive analyses of healthcare needs and existing resources. These analyses include evaluations of emergency services, primary care, specialized non-stationary care, and hospital care, as well as assessments of whether medical establishments meet required standards.\nEach regional health map contains detailed information about the region’s demographic structure, disease patterns across different population groups, hospitalization rates, the number and distribution of existing medical establishments, and their activities. The maps also specify the necessary minimum number of physicians, dental practitioners, and healthcare specialists by specialty, the number of hospital beds, the types of medical activities performed, and information about high-tech diagnostic and treatment methods available in the region.\nThese regional maps must include proposals for distributing hospital beds and medical activities according to population needs, as well as recommendations regarding healthcare professional requirements. The commissions may also suggest restructuring medical establishments or optimizing healthcare delivery, including the creation of specialized services like palliative care.\nThe National Health Map is compiled by a national commission appointed by and chaired by the Minister of Health. This commission includes the head of the National Health Insurance Fund, directors of key health agencies, representatives from professional medical associations, municipalities, and patient organizations. The national map synthesizes the regional maps and establishes the broader framework for healthcare delivery across the country.\nThe National Health Map identifies regional needs for healthcare professionals in various specialties, determines the appropriate number of hospital beds and medical activities by type and level of competence, maps existing medical establishments, provides analyses of regional conditions, and specifies medical activities to be planned at the regional level. It also includes maps of high-technology diagnostic and treatment methods and their associated equipment, as well as a map of first aid services showing the number and location of first aid centers.\nImportantly, the National Health Map serves as the basis for financial decisions. Medical establishments for hospital care can receive funding from the state budget or the National Health Insurance Fund only for activities that comply with the requirements outlined in the map and related regulations. This creates a direct link between healthcare planning and resource allocation.\nThe National Health Map is approved by the Council of Ministers based on a proposal from the Minister of Health. It undergoes complete updating every three years, with partial updates made as necessary according to defined methodologies. The map is mandatory for planning medical activities in medical establishments, with certain exceptions for dental medicine facilities.\nIn regions where the number of hospital beds exceeds the needs defined in the National Health Map, the directors of Regional Health Insurance Funds sign contracts with selected medical establishments based on criteria established by the Council of Ministers. This mechanism helps control healthcare capacity and ensures appropriate distribution of resources.\nThrough this comprehensive system of health mapping, Bulgaria aims to create a healthcare network that responds to population needs while maintaining efficiency in resource allocation and service delivery.\n\n\nChapter VII.\n\nSection I. Founding medical establishments\nMedical establishments related to emergency care, transfusion services, psychiatric care, specialized children’s services, and those affiliated with government ministries are founded through a structured governmental process. The Council of Ministers establishes these facilities based on proposals from the Minister of Health, with coordination from relevant ministries when appropriate. These establishments operate as corporate entities with budget support for their specific functions.\nThe organizational structure and activities of these state-founded establishments are regulated through specific regulations issued by different authorities: the Minister of Health oversees emergency medical centers, transfusion centers, psychiatric care establishments, and facilities for children; the Council of Ministers regulates establishments affiliated with specific ministries; and the Minister of Defense, in coordination with the Minister of Health, oversees military medical institutions.\nBefore regulations are issued for these establishments, they must undergo verification by regional health inspections to ensure compliance with medical standards and health requirements. Special provisions apply to establishments planning to conduct organ transplantation activities or perform other specialized procedures, requiring additional verification and certification by the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision.”\nMedical establishments for non-stationary care and hospices are formed as trade companies or cooperatives, following specific registration procedures. When necessary, the state and municipalities may establish such facilities as limited liability or joint-stock companies. Individual and group practices for primary and specialized medical care have specific registration requirements, with individual practices established by physicians or dental practitioners registered directly.\nTissue banks must be established as limited liability or joint-stock companies and can only operate after receiving a permit. Their activities are strictly limited to those specified in the law.\nMedical establishments for hospital care, mental health centers, dermatology centers, complex oncology centers, and dialysis centers can be established by various entities, including state, municipal, legal, and natural persons. These establishments must operate only after obtaining a permit as outlined in the law. Their activities are strictly limited to hospital care and related specific functions. When the state or municipalities establish such facilities, they must be formed as limited liability or joint-stock companies. State-founded establishments require an act of the Council of Ministers, while municipally-founded establishments need municipal council permission and consent from the Minister of Health.\nA particularly rigorous process applies to the formation of new hospital care establishments, requiring Council of Ministers approval based on a comprehensive assessment conducted by the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision.” This assessment considers population healthcare needs according to the National Health Insurance Card and evaluates detailed project information, business plans, funding sources, and professional opinions. The Council’s approval decision specifies the type of establishment, its structure, bed capacity, medical activities, and implementation timeframe.\nSimilarly stringent procedures govern the introduction of new medical activities in existing hospital establishments, requiring ministerial approval based on comprehensive assessments of healthcare needs and operational capabilities. The Minister of Health’s authorization order specifies the types of new activities, implementing structures, bed capacity, competence levels, and project timeline.\nFor state and municipal medical establishments, special provisions exempt them from certain Commerce Act requirements regarding non-cash capital contributions. Instead, all long-term assets are valued at their balance sheet value when determining the company’s capital.\nThis structured approach to founding medical establishments ensures that new healthcare facilities and services align with population needs, meet quality standards, operate within appropriate legal frameworks, and utilize resources efficiently within Bulgaria’s healthcare system.\n\n\nSection II: Registration of Medical Establishments\nThis section details the registration process for medical establishments for non-stationary (outpatient) care and hospices in Bulgaria, as well as the registration of medical activities in university settings.\nMedical establishments requiring registration include outpatient care facilities, hospices, and certain medical activities in university settings where up to 10 beds for observation and treatment for up to 48 hours may be provided. If longer stays become necessary in university settings, the medical or dental faculty must arrange hospitalization for the patient. The Minister of Health determines the basic requirements for the structure, activity, and internal operations of these establishments through an ordinance.\nThe registration process is managed by the Executive Director of the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” and begins with an application that includes the unified identification code of the company or cooperative from the Commercial Register. For facilities registering in Bulgaria, applicants must submit documentation including rules for structure and operations, names of partners or shareholders, diplomas and specialty certifications for managing personnel, permits for any equipment using ionizing radiation, and proof of paid state fees. The application is initially submitted to the Regional Health Inspection.\nFor companies registered in European Union member states or states party to the European Economic Area Agreement, a document verifying current registration under their national legislation is required. The Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” checks criminal backgrounds of management personnel, with non-Bulgarian citizens required to submit criminal record documentation.\nWithin 10 days of receiving an application, the Regional Health Inspectorate conducts a compliance check to ensure the establishment meets health requirements and approved medical standards. If deficiencies are found, the inspectorate prescribes corrections and sets a time limit not exceeding three months. Simultaneously, the inspectorate requests certificates from professional organizations—the Bulgarian Medical Association, Bulgarian Dental Association, or Bulgarian Association of Healthcare Professionals—verifying the registration of medical professionals who will work at the establishment.\nFor university medical activities, the registration application is submitted by the university’s Rector and must include details about the higher education institution, diplomas and specialty certificates of department heads and teaching staff, permits for equipment using ionizing radiation, institutional accreditation, program accreditation, information on available beds, and proof of paid state fees.\nSpecial provisions apply for establishments planning to perform organ, tissue, and cell transplantation or assisted reproduction. In these cases, the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” conducts additional checks to verify compliance with established medical standards in these specialized fields. If discrepancies are found, corrections must be made within three months.\nThe Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” maintains a comprehensive public register of medical establishments that includes registration certificates, establishment details, management information, permitted activities, and any subsequent changes or terminations. A separate section records applications in process. Fees for registration certificates and register use are determined by the Council of Ministers.\nRegistered establishments must inform the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” about any changes within seven days of their occurrence. The Executive Director may issue a motivated refusal of registration for several reasons, including document omissions, criminal convictions of management personnel, failure to meet health requirements, non-compliance with medical standards, or lack of proper professional registration of medical staff. Such refusals can be appealed through the administrative court system.\nRegistration can be canceled under various circumstances: if a founding doctor or dentist is deleted from their professional register, for violations of registration terms or approved medical standards, for extended suspension of activity, upon request of the establishment, or upon termination of the corporate body or death of the registered person. For university medical activities, registration can be canceled upon request of the university rector, closure of the relevant faculty, expiration of program accreditation, or activities violating registration terms.\nCancellation orders can be appealed through the administrative court system, though filing an appeal does not suspend the order’s execution. This ensures that regulatory actions to protect public health take immediate effect, even during the appeal process.\nThis detailed registration framework creates a standardized, transparent system for authorizing and monitoring outpatient care facilities, ensuring they meet professional, technical, and safety standards before beginning operations and throughout their existence.\n\n\nSection III: Permit for Medical Activities\nThis section outlines the comprehensive framework governing the authorization process for medical establishments providing hospital care and specialized medical services in Bulgaria.\nMedical establishments requiring operating permits include hospitals, mental health centers, dermatology centers, complex oncology centers, homes for medical-social care, dialysis centers, and tissue banks. The Minister of Health issues these permits based on recommendations from the Executive Director of the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision.”\nThe basic structural, operational, and organizational requirements for hospital care facilities and medical-social care homes are established through ministerial ordinances. For hospital care establishments, permits are granted only after approval by the Council of Ministers through the formal assessment process described in Article 37a.\nThe permit application process begins with the medical establishment submitting documentation to the Regional Health Inspection, including: - Company registration information or documentation of current registration for entities from EU/EEA countries - Organizational and operational rules - Higher education credentials for management personnel, including health management qualifications - Identity information for members of management and control bodies - Permits for any equipment using ionizing radiation - Standard operating procedures for tissue banks - Proof of paid state fees\nThe Regional Health Inspection conducts an initial review within 20 days, verifying compliance with legal requirements, ministerial ordinances, and approved medical standards. If deficiencies are identified, the inspection gives the establishment up to three months to address them. Simultaneously, the inspection requests professional registration verification from the Bulgarian Medical Association or Bulgarian Dental Association for physicians and dentists in management positions.\nFor establishments planning to perform organ transplantation or assisted reproduction, the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision” conducts specialized verification of compliance with established medical standards in these fields. Any discrepancies must be corrected within three months.\nWithin 75 days of the initial application filing, the Minister of Health issues an operating permit or provides a reasoned refusal. The permit specifies crucial details including the establishment’s full name, identification codes, authorized medical activities and specialties, competence levels of different structural units, and physical address.\nThe Minister may refuse a permit for several reasons: if the Council of Ministers denied establishment approval; if document deficiencies weren’t corrected; if management personnel have criminal convictions; if the establishment fails to meet health requirements or medical standards; or if physicians and dentists aren’t properly registered with their professional organizations. Such refusals can be appealed through the administrative court system.\nThe Ministry of Health maintains a public register of all permitted medical establishments, recording permit details, establishment information, competence levels, management personnel, authorized activities, and any subsequent changes or revocations. Permitted establishments must notify authorities of any changes in their circumstances within seven days. Substantial changes to the permit, particularly adding new medical activities, require the same rigorous approval process as initial permits.\nThe Minister of Health may revoke permits under specific circumstances: if the permit was issued based on false information; if the establishment performs unauthorized activities; if it violates health legislation; if it repeatedly violates medical standards; if it fails to begin operations or suspends them for six months; or upon the establishment’s request to terminate activities. Revocation orders specify when medical activities must cease and can be appealed through the administrative court system, though appeals don’t suspend the order’s execution.\nFor serious but isolated violations, the Minister may partially revoke a permit, restricting only the specific medical specialties involved rather than stopping all operations. This balanced approach allows continued operation of compliant departments while addressing problematic areas.\nThis comprehensive permitting system ensures that hospital care and specialized medical services in Bulgaria are provided only by establishments that meet rigorous standards of professional qualification, technical capability, and organizational structure. The process balances the need for thorough oversight with reasonable timeframes and clear appeal mechanisms, supporting the overall goal of maintaining high-quality healthcare services throughout the country.\n\n\nSection IV: Closing Down Medical Establishments\nThis section describes the process and requirements for closing medical establishments in Bulgaria, ensuring orderly transition and protection of patient interests during these procedures.\nFor state medical establishments under Article 5, paragraph 1, closure is initiated through an act of the Council of Ministers based on a proposal from the Minister of Health, coordinated with the relevant ministry. This closure act specifies which minister will appoint the liquidation commission members, establishes the timeframe and tasks for the commission, and allocates necessary resources for completing the liquidation process.\nThe liquidation commission consists of at least five members, including representatives from the administrative body or municipality where the establishment was registered, the Ministry of Health, and qualified legal and economic professionals. Commission members enter into contracts with the supervising minister, who ultimately accepts the commission’s concluding report.\nThe specific conditions and procedures for liquidating state medical establishments are determined by a Council of Ministers ordinance, providing standardized guidance for these complex processes.\nFor medical establishments organized as trade companies or cooperatives, termination and liquidation follow the Commerce Act procedures, with foreign companies following their national legislation. However, in bankruptcy proceedings for medical establishments, certain provisions of the Commerce Act are modified—cash distraint as security is not permitted, and some standard bankruptcy provisions do not apply. Municipal medical establishments can only be terminated with the consent of the Minister of Health.\nWhen terminating a medical establishment, the decision must designate one or more liquidators and specify their remuneration. A liquidator must possess specific qualifications, including higher education with a master’s degree in medicine, dental medicine, economics, or law. They cannot have been deprived of the right to hold material accountancy positions or have been involved in companies terminated due to insolvency with unsatisfied creditors.\nThe liquidators have specific public notification responsibilities—they must announce the termination of medical activities in at least one central and one local daily newspaper within seven days of their appointment and post notices in public locations and at the medical establishment. They must also inform the district health insurance fund and the territorial directorate of the National Revenue Agency about the liquidation within fourteen days of appointment.\nDuring the liquidation process, liquidators must create conditions for completing any ongoing medical activities while prioritizing patient interests. Particularly important is their obligation to ensure patients can access their medical records and treatment documentation from the establishment being liquidated, protecting continuity of care during this transitional period.\nThis structured approach to closing medical establishments balances administrative and financial considerations with the paramount need to protect patient welfare, ensuring that even during institutional closure, healthcare needs remain a priority.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nSection I. Structure of Medical Establishments for Hospital Care\nMedical establishments for hospital care in Bulgaria are structured as comprehensive healthcare facilities comprised of several key components. These include clinics and/or departments with beds, medical diagnostic and technical laboratories, departments without beds, hospital pharmacies, consulting rooms, and units for administrative, economic, and service activities. The level of competence for clinics, departments, and diagnostic laboratories is determined according to established medical standards, with specific criteria and procedures defined by ministerial ordinance.\nA clinic represents a specialized hospital unit focused on a specific medical or dental specialty. It must be headed by an individual with academic rank who is either a physician or dental practitioner. Clinics perform diagnostic and treatment activities while also providing education for students, specialist training, and/or continuing professional qualification. When specified in the medical establishment’s structural regulations, clinics may be further subdivided into departments.\nA department functions as a hospital unit dedicated to a particular medical or dental specialty, led by a physician or dental practitioner with recognized specialization in the relevant field. These units focus primarily on diagnostic and treatment activities but may also participate in post-graduate specialist education or continuing professional qualification.\n\n\nSection II. Management and control of the medical establishments\nManagement and oversight of these medical institutions depend on their organizational structure. Ownership arrangements define who appoints and removes those in charge and the nature of their contracts. Those serving as manager, executive director, or director must hold a master’s credential in medicine, dental medicine, or economics and management, combined with specialized qualifications in the healthcare domain. They are selected through a competitive procedure for a set term, with the possibility of renewal, yet their contracts may end earlier for reasons such as institutional reorganization or failure to meet agreed-upon performance criteria.\nThe person in charge is responsible for the financial stability of the institution and represents it externally. That role also includes appointing and releasing employees, introducing structural adjustments, and submitting information on operations to relevant parties. Certain institutions require a single management tier composed of three members. This leadership cannot simultaneously head clinical departments within the same institution. A chief nurse (or similar professional) ensures quality patient care, proper hygiene standards, and training of other healthcare workers.\nClinical operations are managed by qualified specialists who lead clinics, departments, or laboratories relevant to their field. They employ and release personnel in their area, manage budgets and workflows, and coordinate collaboration with chairs at higher education institutions. Their agreements usually have fixed durations and involve accountability for results. Each institution features bodies devoted to consultation, oversight, and quality control. These range from advisory councils that review activities and propose improvements to commissions that assess the effectiveness of treatment methods, investigate challenging cases, and promote adherence to best practices. Infection prevention teams maintain hospital hygiene and monitor standards for disinfection, while a caregiving council assists the chief nurse in planning and coordinating nursing and related services.\nThis integrated approach ensures transparent management, efficient use of resources, and adherence to standards of care. All individuals with managerial or supervisory duties are expected to fulfill legal, professional, and ethical responsibilities aimed at preserving financial stability and delivering quality healthcare.\n\n\nSection III. Personnel in the medical establishments\nPersonnel in medical establishments in Bulgaria include a diverse range of professionals, such as doctors, dental practitioners, pharmacists, and other specialists with advanced degrees who participate in diagnostic and treatment processes. University hospitals also employ lecturers who are involved in both clinical duties and teaching. Additionally, medical specialists with degrees in medical care, training specialists, and individuals performing administrative and auxiliary activities are part of the personnel.\nDoctors and dental practitioners who work in hospital care can register individual practices for non-stationary specialized care if there is a shortage of such services in their area, as assessed by the regional health inspection. They may also work under contracts with group practices, medical diagnostic laboratories, and hospital care establishments. The National Health Insurance Fund can contract with these medical establishments for out-hospital care if there is a demonstrated need based on the National Health Map.\nUniversity hospitals must employ physicians with recognized qualifications under primary employment contracts, ensuring that these institutions maintain a high standard of medical expertise. The educational and research activities in university hospitals are coordinated with higher education institutions, following approved plans and programs.\nMedical establishments are required to employ qualified physicians and ensure that their staff includes individuals with the necessary educational and professional credentials. The appointment of lecturers in university hospitals follows the procedures outlined in the Higher Education Act, with competitions announced by the respective higher school in coordination with the hospital management.\nPersonnel working in medical establishments with reduced working hours may work in shifts, with the maximum length of a working shift being up to 12 hours, regardless of the reduced working time. This provision ensures flexibility in staffing while maintaining compliance with labor regulations.\nOverall, the framework for personnel in medical establishments in Bulgaria emphasizes the importance of qualified professionals, continuous education, and adherence to regulatory standards to ensure high-quality healthcare services.\n\n\nSection IV. Hospital board of trustees\nThis section outlines the establishment and functions of hospital boards of trustees in medical establishments for hospital care in Bulgaria.\nHospital boards of trustees can be set up at medical establishments for hospital care to assist in better satisfying public needs for medical services. The purpose of these boards is to support the hospital’s activities and enhance the quality and accessibility of medical services provided to the community.\nThe hospital board of trustees is established by the owners of the medical establishment. To form the board, the owners extend invitations through mass media and personally invite owners, donors, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and other relevant individuals. These invitees then elect the number and members of the hospital board of trustees from among themselves.\nThe hospital board of trustees meets at least once a year. Meetings can be initiated by one-third of its members, at the request of the hospital’s managing body, or at the request of the owner. During these meetings, the board invites the hospital’s managing body to provide information about the condition and operations of the establishment.\nThe hospital board of trustees has several key responsibilities: - Assisting in the creation and maintenance of the hospital’s installations, equipment, and real estate. - Proposing measures to the owner for improving the hospital’s activities. - Conducting actions and information campaigns, if necessary, to mobilize public support and resources for the hospital.\nBy fulfilling these roles, the hospital board of trustees plays a crucial part in ensuring that medical establishments operate effectively and continue to meet the healthcare needs of the community.\n\n\n\nChapter IX is repealed\n\n\nChapter X.\nMedical establishments in Bulgaria play a crucial role in medical education, encompassing clinical training for students and postgraduate education for healthcare professionals. These establishments can engage in clinical education for students and PhD candidates in medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, as well as students in health care disciplines. They also provide postgraduate education for doctors, dental practitioners, pharmacists, and health care specialists.\nTo carry out these educational activities, medical establishments must receive approval from the Minister of Health. The criteria and conditions for approval, including the necessary structure, organization, equipment, and personnel qualifications, are determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. The Council of Ministers, based on a proposal from the Minister of Health, designates which medical establishments or their specific clinics or wards will acquire the status of university hospitals for the duration of the approval period. This proposal is made following a request from the rector of the respective higher school, coordinated with the head of the medical establishment.\nThe Council of Ministers may also withdraw the university hospital status before the approval period expires. University hospitals admit patients with diseases included in training programs for students and postgraduate students. The conditions and procedures for conducting education, as well as its financing, are outlined in contracts between the medical establishment and the higher school. Financing for student and doctoral training comes from the state budget allocated for education and science, while training for healthcare specialties at state-funded positions is financed from the healthcare budget.\nThe criteria for medical establishments to acquire university hospital status are specified by an ordinance from the Council of Ministers. To obtain approval, the head of the medical establishment must submit an application to the Minister of Health, including justification for compliance with the criteria and a document for a paid state fee. An expert commission appointed by the Minister of Health verifies compliance, and an advisory council provides an opinion on approval or refusal. The advisory council includes representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Executive Agency “Medical Supervision,” the National Health Insurance Fund, professional medical associations, and patient rights organizations.\nThe Minister of Health issues an order approving or refusing the application within two months of submission. Refusals can be appealed under the Administrative-Procedure Code. Approved medical establishments are listed in a public register maintained by the Ministry of Health, which includes details of the approval order, the name of the establishment, and the types of training and specialties offered. The approval is valid for five years, but the Minister of Health may revoke it if the establishment no longer meets the criteria.\nThis framework ensures that medical establishments in Bulgaria contribute effectively to the education and training of healthcare professionals, maintaining high standards and supporting the national healthcare system.\n\n\nChapter XI.\nMedical establishments, regardless of ownership, are required to collaborate and pool their resources during natural disasters, epidemics, and other extraordinary circumstances when societal interests demand joint activities. The expenses incurred by medical establishments in such situations are reimbursed by the state, following a decision by the Council of Ministers.\nMedical establishments have the option to enter into agreements with each other to provide medical specialists, services, and other activities. They can also sign contracts with licensed insurers to offer additional services. State and municipal hospitals are permitted to treat patients on a direct payment basis, but this is limited to no more than 10 percent of their available beds. The heads of departments and clinics are responsible for managing the use of these beds.\nMedical establishments may establish and participate in self-assessment and rating systems to evaluate the quality of their medical, organizational, financial, and administrative activities. Participation in these systems is voluntary and can involve collaboration with other medical establishments, professional organizations, and patient groups. The criteria for participation, functioning, and assessment elements are determined by the involved parties. Medical establishments must disclose their participation in these systems and keep updated information available online to inform patients and other stakeholders. They are also required to publish information on their ratings based on relevant indicators on their websites.\n\n\nChapter XII.\nMedical establishments can be financed through multiple sources, including the National Health Insurance Fund, state and municipal budgets, licensed insurers, and contributions from local and foreign corporate bodies and individuals. The revenue of medical establishments is generated from contracts for provided medical care, direct payments by individuals and corporate bodies, reimbursement of expenses by third parties, subsidies from the state and municipal budgets, rentals of equipment and premises, donations, wills, and other sources.\nMedical establishments that provide services without a contract with the National Health Insurance Fund must establish their own pricing for these services. They are required to develop internal rules for the allocation of financial resources and must publicly display information on the types and prices of all services provided, both within their facilities and on their websites. Additionally, they must issue financial documents to patients for all amounts paid in connection with their services.\nThe cost of medical services does not include expenses for the education of students, specialists, and doctoral candidates, long-term qualification, or scientific research. These expenses are subject to individual contracting between the assignor and the medical establishment.\nState and municipal medical establishments may receive targeted subsidies approved by the State Budget Act and municipal budgets. These subsidies can be used for acquiring long-term material assets, basic repairs or renovations related to reorganization, information technologies and systems, and financial recovery of hospital care establishments. Medical establishments located in regions of increased health risk may also receive targeted subsidies.\nThe financing of activities related to investment expenses can be implemented according to the state or municipal participation in the capital of the medical establishments. Funds provided from the state or municipal budget for settling obligations of state medical establishments or those with mixed state and municipal ownership are accounted as an increase in their capital. Medical equipment and other long-term tangible assets purchased through central supply are provided by the Ministry of Health to state and municipal medical establishments according to their purpose. If a medical establishment fails to pay for the equipment within three months, its capital is increased by the value of the equipment, and the state subscribes for new shares.\nThe budget funds provided for capital expenditures are also accounted as an increase in the capital of the medical establishments. Unused funds for capital expenditures must be refunded to the state budget. The provisions of the Commerce Act and the statute or company contract regarding capital increases do not apply in these cases. The amendments are carried out through an application to the commercial register by the Minister of Health or an authorized official.\nThe funding and capital increases must comply with the requirements of the State Aid Act. Dialysis centers can be financed by the National Health Insurance Fund based on contracts in compliance with the fund’s budget.\nThis comprehensive financing framework ensures that medical establishments in Bulgaria have access to diverse funding sources and mechanisms, enabling them to maintain and improve their facilities, equipment, and services to meet the healthcare needs of the population.\n\n\nChapter XIII.\n\nSection I: Transformation of the public health establishments\nPublic medical establishments for hospital care, dispensaries, and hospital diagnostic and treatment structures affiliated with higher education institutions are to be transformed into sole owner trade companies by an order of the Minister of Health. This transformation must be completed by a specified date, and the newly formed companies must apply for permits to carry out medical activities within one month of their court registration. Until the permits are obtained, these establishments can continue their medical activities.\nThe transformation process includes the enactment of specific ordinances that define the requirements and procedures for these changes. For hospital diagnostic and treatment structures at higher education institutions, national centers carrying out medical activities, state pulmonary hospitals, and the Scientific Institute for Emergency Medical Care “Pirogov,” the ownership of their capital is acquired by the state, with the Minister of Health exercising the rights.\nPublic health establishments transformed into joint-stock companies have their capital ownership divided between the state and the municipalities of the region served by the establishment. The state’s share is managed by the Minister of Health, while the municipalities’ share is proportional to the population they serve. Other public health establishments are transformed into medical establishments for hospital care or specific types of medical establishments, with their capital owned by the municipality where the headquarters are located.\nPublic health establishments for non-stationary care are also transformed into sole owner trade companies by an order of the Minister of Health. These establishments must be registered with the regional health inspections and can only operate as specific types of medical establishments. The terms of employment for medical specialists in these establishments are governed by the Labor Code.\nPhysicians and dental practitioners working in transformed medical establishments for out-hospital care must conclude rental contracts for premises, equipment, and apparatuses with the managing bodies of the establishments. These contracts are subject to specific pricing and conditions, and managing bodies cannot unilaterally terminate them if there is a contract with the National Health Insurance Fund. In case of refusal to conclude a rental contract, the affected parties can seek a court order to finalize the contract.\nThe property of non-transformed public health establishments for out-hospital care is managed by the mayor of the municipality or an authorized person, with medical specialists having rights to rental contracts for premises and equipment.\nPublic sanatorium and medical recovery health establishments are transformed into sole owner trade companies with state property by an order of the Minister of Health. These establishments must apply for permits to carry out medical activities within six months of transformation.\nThe real estate and chattel of transformed public health establishments are transferred to state property, and the newly formed trade companies become legal successors of the original establishments. The legal terms of employment for staff in these transformed establishments are governed by the Labor Code.\nThe renting and administering of real estate and chattel of state or municipal medical establishments, as well as those with mixed state and municipal participation, require approval from the sole owner of the capital or the Board of Directors if the total value exceeds a specified percentage of the company’s long-term assets. Cash proceeds from these activities are used for investments directly related to the establishment’s activities and for satisfying creditor interests with permission from the owner of the capital.\nThe state and municipalities may fund medical establishments for executing national, regional, and municipal health programs and projects, as well as for performing certain medical activities beyond obligatory health insurance. Funding is provided through contracts between the respective state or municipal body and the medical establishment. The state may also provide subsidies to hospital establishments in hard-to-reach or remote areas, with criteria and procedures determined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health.\nThe Ministry of Health subsidizes state and municipal medical establishments for specific activities, including emergency medical care, maintenance of medical records, and medical expertise. Subsidies are provided based on one-year contracts within the budget allocated for these activities and in compliance with the State Aid Act.\nPublic health establishments that are not transformed are closed down by the Council of Ministers and liquidated according to established procedures.\nThis comprehensive framework ensures that the transformation and privatization of public medical establishments in Bulgaria are conducted in an orderly manner, with clear guidelines for ownership, management, and funding, while maintaining the quality and accessibility of healthcare services."

    "text": "Chapter I.\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria regulates the health insurance system and the associated social relationships. Health insurance in Bulgaria consists of compulsory and voluntary health insurance activities. These activities involve raising health insurance contributions and premiums, managing the collected resources, and spending these resources on purchasing healthcare activities and services, as well as paying for goods as stipulated by the Act, the National Framework Agreements (NFA), and insurance contracts.\nCompulsory health insurance is managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and its territorial units, the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF). This type of insurance provides a package of health activities guaranteed by the NHIF budget. The National Revenue Agency is responsible for collecting the compulsory health insurance contributions, which are fixed by statute. The NHIF purchases healthcare activities from medical care providers, ensuring these activities meet specific criteria for type, volume, price, quality, and accessibility.\nVoluntary health insurance, on the other hand, involves taking on financial risks related to the provision of certain healthcare services and goods. This is done in exchange for premiums charged based on insurance contracts. This type of insurance allows for additional coverage beyond what is provided by the compulsory health insurance system."

    "section": "Chapter II.",
    "text": "Chapter II.\n\nSection I. General Provisions\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria establishes the framework for the health insurance system and the associated social relationships. It defines health insurance as an activity involving the collection of health insurance contributions and premiums, managing these resources, and spending them on healthcare activities and services, as well as paying for goods as stipulated by the Act, the National Framework Agreements (NFA), and insurance contracts. Health insurance in Bulgaria is divided into compulsory and voluntary health insurance.\nCompulsory health insurance is managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and its territorial units, the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF). This system guarantees insured persons access to a package of health activities funded by the NHIF budget. The National Revenue Agency is responsible for collecting compulsory health insurance contributions, which are fixed by statute. The NHIF purchases healthcare activities from medical care providers, ensuring these activities meet specific criteria for type, volume, price, quality, and accessibility.\nVoluntary health insurance involves taking on financial risks related to the provision of certain healthcare services and goods in exchange for premiums charged based on insurance contracts. This type of insurance allows for additional coverage beyond what is provided by the compulsory health insurance system.\nThe principles of compulsory health insurance include compulsory participation in raising contributions, participation of the state, insured individuals, and employers in managing the NHIF, solidarity among the insured, responsibility for personal health, non-discrimination in accessing medical care, non-discrimination of medical care providers in contracting with RHIFs, self-management of the NHIF, contractual relationships between the NHIF and medical care providers, a guaranteed package of health activities funded by the NHIF budget, free choice of medical care providers by the insured, and public openness and control over NHIF operations and expenditures.\n\n\nSection II. National Health Insurance Fund\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Bulgaria is a legal entity based in Sofia, responsible for implementing compulsory health insurance. The NHIF comprises a Head Office, Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF), and their divisions. The Council of Ministers determines the headquarters of the RHIFs, while the NHIF Manager decides the locations of their divisions.\nThe NHIF’s management bodies include the Supervisory Board and the Manager. Employees of the NHIF and RHIFs work under civil-service or employment relationships, adhering to the Labour Code. The NHIF is prohibited from providing voluntary health insurance.\nThe Supervisory Board consists of nine members, including representatives from patient rights organizations, workers’ organizations, employers’ organizations, and the state. The Board is elected for a five-year term, with provisions for pre-term release under specific conditions. The Board’s functions include adopting NHIF operational rules, participating in drafting the National Framework Agreement (NFA), approving the NHIF budget, controlling the Manager’s activities, and making decisions on significant contracts and expenditures.\nThe NHIF Manager, elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term, oversees the NHIF’s operations, drafts the annual budget, prepares financial statements, and represents the NHIF domestically and internationally. The Manager is assisted by an Assistant Manager and can be pre-term released under certain conditions.\nThe Director of each RHIF represents the NHIF locally, organizes RHIF operations, and manages contracts with medical care providers. Directors must hold a master’s degree and have relevant experience. They are appointed through a competitive process.\nEligibility for NHIF and RHIF management positions excludes non-Bulgarian nationals, individuals with prohibitory injunctions, those convicted of premeditated public law offenses, and others with conflicts of interest. These restrictions ensure that NHIF and RHIF leaders maintain integrity and avoid conflicts of interest in their roles.\n\n\nSection III. Financial Structure of the National Health Insurance Fund\nThe financial structure of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Bulgaria is designed to ensure the effective management and allocation of resources for compulsory health insurance. The NHIF operates with a budget that is separate from the state budget, serving as a financial master plan for raising and disbursing funds related to compulsory health insurance.\nThe NHIF’s revenues come from various sources, including insurance contributions, transfers from the state budget for specific groups, interest income, income from property management, refunds of insurance expenses, proceeds from fines and penalties, fees, portions of residual assets from liquidated debtor corporations, action subsidies from the state budget, donations, legacies, and other sources. In case of resource deficiencies, the NHIF can contract short-term interest-free loans from the state budget.\nThe NHIF’s expenditures cover the purchase of medical care as specified in the National Framework Agreement and contracts with providers, administrative costs of health insurance activities, issuance of documents, expenses for the NHIF’s needs, fees for servicing the collection of health insurance contributions, medical care provided under social security coordination rules, and other expenses. The NHIF budget also includes a mandatory reserve for contingency and urgent expenses, set at three percent of collected revenue from health insurance contributions and transfers from other budgets.\nTemporarily free resources of the NHIF are deposited at the Bulgarian National Bank and may be used to acquire government securities. The banks handling NHIF resources are designated jointly by the Bulgarian National Bank and the Ministry of Finance, with the NHIF Supervisory Board selecting the banks to be entrusted with these resources.\nThe NHIF Manager, as the first-level spending unit, oversees the NHIF’s budget, while the directors of the regional health insurance funds act as second-level spending units. The NHIF Manager submits a draft of the National Health Insurance Budget Act to the Council of Ministers, which is then debated by the National Assembly alongside the state budget and public social insurance budget. The NHIF budget act sets forth the rate of compulsory health insurance contributions, revenues, expenditures, and specific allocations for various types of medical care.\nIf the NHIF budget act is not passed by the National Assembly before the start of the budget year, insurance revenues and expenses are managed based on the previous year’s budget. The NHIF Manager submits the annual budget implementation report and activity report to the National Assembly by June 30 of the following year.\nThe NHIF is prohibited from owning treatment and healthcare facilities or pharmacies. It is responsible for collecting, processing, and controlling reports from hospital medical care providers regarding activities subject to the National Framework Agreement. This financial structure ensures that the NHIF operates efficiently, transparently, and in alignment with Bulgaria’s healthcare needs and policies.\n\n\nSection IV. Insured Persons. Rights and Obligations\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria outlines the rights and obligations of insured persons under the compulsory health insurance system managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). This system covers all Bulgarian nationals who are not citizens of another state, those who are citizens of another state but reside permanently in Bulgaria, foreign citizens or stateless persons with long-term or permanent residence permits, individuals with recognized refugee or humanitarian status, foreign students and doctoral candidates studying in Bulgaria, and other persons covered by the rules for coordination of social security schemes. However, individuals subject to health insurance in another member state are not covered by the NHIF.\nThe obligation to obtain health insurance arises at different times depending on the individual’s status. For Bulgarian citizens, it begins at birth or the date of the Act’s entry into force. For foreign residents, it starts upon receiving a residence permit, and for refugees, it begins when the procedure for recognition of their status is initiated. Foreign students are covered from the date of enrollment in their educational institution. The rights of insured persons commence from birth, the initiation of refugee status procedures, enrollment in educational institutions, or the payment of health insurance contributions.\nInsured persons have several entitlements, including access to medical care within the NHIF-guaranteed package, the right to choose a primary care physician, emergency care, information about NHIF contracts with medical providers, participation in NHIF management through representatives, lodging complaints about legal or contractual violations, obtaining necessary documents for exercising health insurance rights, and cross-border healthcare. Complaints can be lodged with the Director of the respective Regional Health Insurance Fund (RHIF) if there are issues with medical activities, such as unperformed accounted activities, substandard care, denied access to medical documentation, or unjustified charges.\nInsured individuals must follow medical care providers’ directions and fulfill disease prevention requirements as per the National Framework Agreement and provider contracts. They are also obligated to provide the National Revenue Agency with health insurance particulars monthly and file declarations for health insurance installments. Foreigners staying in Bulgaria and dual nationals not covered by Bulgarian health insurance must pay for medical care unless covered by an international treaty.\nInsured persons must pay fees for each visit to a physician or dentist and for each day of hospital treatment, up to ten days annually. Lower fees apply to pensioners. Exemptions from fees are granted to individuals with specific diseases, minors, war veterans, detainees, indigent persons, and medical specialists. Physicians and dentists must issue receipts for fees paid, and any difference between standard and reduced fees is covered by the executive budget.\nThe health insurance status required for exercising rights is based on data from applications, declarations, public records, written evidence, and paid or payable contributions. This comprehensive framework ensures that insured persons in Bulgaria have access to necessary healthcare services while fulfilling their obligations under the compulsory health insurance system.\n\n\nSection V. Health Insurance Contributions\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria outlines the rights and obligations of insured persons under the compulsory health insurance system managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). This system covers all Bulgarian nationals who are not citizens of another state, those who are citizens of another state but reside permanently in Bulgaria, foreign citizens or stateless persons with long-term or permanent residence permits, individuals with recognized refugee or humanitarian status, foreign students and doctoral candidates studying in Bulgaria, and other persons covered by the rules for coordination of social security schemes. However, individuals subject to health insurance in another member state are not covered by the NHIF.\nThe obligation to obtain health insurance arises at different times depending on the individual’s status. For Bulgarian citizens, it begins at birth or the date of the Act’s entry into force. For foreign residents, it starts upon receiving a residence permit, and for refugees, it begins when the procedure for recognition of their status is initiated. Foreign students are covered from the date of enrollment in their educational institution. The rights of insured persons commence from birth, the initiation of refugee status procedures, enrollment in educational institutions, or the payment of health insurance contributions.\nInsured persons have several entitlements, including access to medical care within the NHIF-guaranteed package, the right to choose a primary care physician, emergency care, information about NHIF contracts with medical providers, participation in NHIF management through representatives, lodging complaints about legal or contractual violations, obtaining necessary documents for exercising health insurance rights, and cross-border healthcare. Complaints can be lodged with the Director of the respective Regional Health Insurance Fund (RHIF) if there are issues with medical activities, such as unperformed accounted activities, substandard care, denied access to medical documentation, or unjustified charges.\nInsured individuals must follow medical care providers’ directions and fulfill disease prevention requirements as per the National Framework Agreement and provider contracts. They are also obligated to provide the National Revenue Agency with health insurance particulars monthly and file declarations for health insurance installments. Foreigners staying in Bulgaria and dual nationals not covered by Bulgarian health insurance must pay for medical care unless covered by an international treaty.\nInsured persons must pay fees for each visit to a physician or dentist and for each day of hospital treatment, up to ten days annually. Lower fees apply to pensioners. Exemptions from fees are granted to individuals with specific diseases, minors, war veterans, detainees, indigent persons, and medical specialists. Physicians and dentists must issue receipts for fees paid, and any difference between standard and reduced fees is covered by the executive budget.\nThe health insurance status required for exercising rights is based on data from applications, declarations, public records, written evidence, and paid or payable contributions. This comprehensive framework ensures that insured persons in Bulgaria have access to necessary healthcare services while fulfilling their obligations under the compulsory health insurance system.\nHealth insurance contributions are determined based on various factors, including income and employment status. Employers and employees share the cost of contributions, with specific ratios defined for different periods. Self-employed individuals, pensioners, and other specific groups have distinct contribution requirements. Contributions are remitted to the National Revenue Agency and are used exclusively for implementing health insurance activities. The state budget covers contributions for certain groups, such as war veterans, disabled individuals, and students. Bulgarian citizens residing abroad for extended periods can opt out of paying contributions but must meet specific conditions for reinstatement upon return.\n\n\nSection VI. Scope of Medical Care Covered by Compulsory Health Insurance\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria outlines the scope of medical care covered by compulsory health insurance, managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). The NHIF pays for various types of medical care, including disease prevention, early disease detection, non-hospital and hospital care for disease detection and treatment, long-term and rehabilitative care, urgent medical care, maternity care, therapeutic abortion, dental care, nursing care at home, prescription and dispensation of medicinal drugs and medical goods for home treatment, medical expert certification of working ability, transportation services on medical indications, and medical activities and medicinal products outside the scope of mandatory health insurance.\nThe NHIF guarantees a package of medical care funded by its budget, defined by an ordinance from the Minister of Health. This package includes criteria for identifying diseases for which the NHIF will fully or partially pay for medications, medical products, and dietetic foods for special medical purposes. The list of diseases is determined by the NHIF Supervisory Board and published in the State Gazette. Changes to this list that increase NHIF expenditure on medicinal products cannot take effect before the amendment of the NHIF Budget Act or the entry into force of the next budget year.\nThe NHIF negotiates discounts on medicinal products with marketing authorization holders, and these discounts are allocated between the NHIF and insured persons. Pharmacies contracted with the NHIF cannot charge insured persons the amount of the negotiated discount. The NHIF also negotiates discounts for medical products used in hospital treatment of malignant diseases and other specified healthcare activities.\nThe procedure for providing medical care and the requirements for providers are specified in the National Framework Agreement and contracts between the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF) and providers. The quality of medical care purchased by the NHIF must meet national medical standards and rules of good medical practice, which include requirements for prompt, sufficient, and high-quality care.\nThe RHIFs purchase medical care for insured persons and transfer funds to the providers. The NHIF periodically informs insured persons about measures to protect and restore their health. Insured individuals must present an identity document when using medical care, and providers must check their health insurance status based on data from the National Revenue Agency.\nThe NHIF does not purchase medical care beyond the scope defined in the Act or the National Framework Agreement (Contract), nor does it cover expenditure on clinical trials of medicinal products and medical devices. Uninsured persons must pay for medical care according to pricelists drafted by the medical care institutions.\n\n\nSection VII. National Framework Agreement\nThe National Framework Agreement (NFA) is a crucial component of the health insurance system in Bulgaria, facilitating the collaboration between the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and professional medical organizations. The NFA outlines the terms and conditions under which medical and dental activities are performed and funded by the NHIF.\nThe NHIF and the Bulgarian Medical Association adopt and sign the NFA for medical activities, while the NHIF and the Bulgarian Dental Association sign the NFA for dental activities. These agreements are concluded for one year and can be updated as necessary. The drafting of the NFA for medical activities involves ten representatives each from the NHIF and the Bulgarian Medical Association, while the NFA for dental activities involves ten representatives each from the NHIF and the Bulgarian Dental Association. The NHIF representatives include members of the Supervisory Board and the NHIF Manager.\nThe NFA must be adopted by a majority of at least seven representatives from both the NHIF and the professional organizations. The agreements are adopted by the end of February each year, come into force on April 1, and take into account the NHIF budget for the corresponding year. The Minister of Health coordinates the adopted NFA within 14 days of submission and promulgates it in the State Gazette. If the NFA is not adopted within the prescribed timeline, the currently effective NFA remains in force.\nThe NFA specifies the conditions that medical care providers must satisfy, the types of medical care covered, the terms and procedures for delivering care, the volumes, prices, and methods for estimating the value of medical care, quality and accessibility criteria, documentation and information exchange requirements, control measures, penalties for contract breaches, and other important aspects of health insurance.\nThe NHIF plans, negotiates, and purchases medical care for insured persons within the volumes agreed upon in the NFA and in accordance with the NHIF budget for the year. Medical care providers can prescribe medicinal products, items, and dietetic foodstuffs for special medical purposes that are fully or partially reimbursed by the NHIF.\nThis framework ensures that the NHIF and professional medical organizations work together to provide high-quality, accessible healthcare services to insured persons in Bulgaria, while maintaining transparency and accountability in the health insurance system.\n\n\nSection VIII. Contract between National Health Insurance Fund and Medical Care Provider\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Bulgaria enters into contracts with medical care providers to ensure the delivery of healthcare services to insured persons. Medical care providers include medical-treatment facilities or their associations and national centers for public health.\nContracts between the NHIF and medical care providers are concluded by the Director of a Regional Health Insurance Fund (RHIF) in accordance with the National Framework Agreement (NFA) and relevant legislation. These contracts must align with the terms adopted by the NFA and remain in force until a new NFA is signed or the existing one is modified. Contracts are executed in writing and specify the requirements and conditions for medical care provision, including accessibility and quality criteria.\nMedical care providers must meet specific criteria to enter into contracts with the NHIF, such as having medical specialists on primary employment contracts, possessing necessary medical apparatuses and technology, providing continuous 24-hour emergency medical assistance, and adhering to established medical standards and good medical practice rules.\nThe NHIF and RHIFs are responsible for informing providers of any changes arising from decisions of their governing bodies or modifications in the NFA. Contracts may be terminated or amended if providers fail to meet the required criteria or if there are violations of medical care quality standards.\nMedical care providers must submit applications to the RHIF for contract signing within 30 days of the NFA’s entry into force. The RHIF Director signs contracts with providers that meet the criteria for accessibility and quality of medical care. Refusals to sign contracts can be appealed through the administrative court system.\nThe NHIF also has the authority to impose penalties or terminate contracts with providers in cases of reported activities not performed, repeated violations, or systematic patient dissatisfaction with medical care. Contracts may only be concluded for hospital medical care activities for which the provider has specialists working under primary employment contracts.\nThis framework ensures that the NHIF collaborates with qualified medical care providers to deliver high-quality, accessible healthcare services to insured persons in Bulgaria, while maintaining transparency and accountability in the health insurance system.\n\n\nSection IX. Information Support of the Operation of the National Health Insurance Fund\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Bulgaria is responsible for building and maintaining an information system that supports its operations. This system includes several key components:\n\nA register of insured persons, which contains identity card details, a unique personal identification number, grounds for entitlement to health insurance, contributions paid, and information on medical care delivered to insured persons in other EU member states.\nA register of persons insured in other EU member states who are entitled to receive medical care in Bulgaria at the expense of the NHIF.\nA register of medical care providers, including their identity card details, professional information, and contracts with the NHIF.\nA register of specialists working at medical treatment facilities under NHIF contracts, detailing their names, professional details, field of specialization, and the type of medical care they provide.\nA register of manufacturers, importers, and distributors of medicinal drugs and pharmacies that have contracts with the NHIF.\nInformation about the activities performed by the controlling authorities.\nAdministrative information essential for the operation of the NHIF.\n\nThe NHIF provides access to this information system for the Ministry of Health. Each insured person has the right to receive information from the NHIF about the medical and dental care they have used in the past five years and the cost of that care. Insured persons can also access information about medical care providers and pharmacies that have contracts with the RHIF for their region.\nMedical care institutions are required to post information in public places within their buildings and on their websites about the healthcare activities guaranteed by the NHIF budget, the cost of these activities, free medical services, cases where targeted funds from the state budget are available, situations where individuals must pay for medical care outside the scope of compulsory health insurance, and information on insurers with whom they have contracts.\nMedical care providers must provide the NHIF with information about the work they perform, in accordance with the conditions, procedures, and volume specified in the National Framework Agreement. The information system uses established national codes and nomenclatures for registering and reporting healthcare services activities. Data and documentation required by the National Framework Agreement may be submitted electronically to the RHIF.\nThe NHIF preserves particulars regarding insured persons for five years after the termination of their health insurance and particulars regarding providers for five years after the termination of their contracts with the NHIF. These particulars are used solely for purposes such as establishing insurance relationships, paying medical care providers, preparing electronic health insurance cards, identifying sums for collection or reimbursement, and exercising financial and medical control.\nThe NHIF is obligated to provide information requested by the Ministry of Health and must ensure that its employees do not disclose personal particulars of insured persons, medical care providers, or employers except as prescribed by statute. The NHIF and RHIF employees are also prohibited from giving professional evaluations or directing patients to specific providers.\nThe Executive Director of the National Revenue Agency drafts and submits information to the Ministry of Health and NHIF about the amount of collected health insurance contributions and collectability trends. This comprehensive information support system ensures that the NHIF operates efficiently, transparently, and in alignment with Bulgaria’s healthcare needs and policies.\n\n\nSection X. Control, Expert Evaluations and Disputes\nThe Health Insurance Act in Bulgaria includes provisions for control, expert evaluations, and dispute resolution to ensure the proper implementation and management of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).\nControl over the NHIF’s budget implementation is exercised by the National Audit Office, while comprehensive financial control is conducted according to the Public Financial Inspection Act. The Supervisory Board oversees the performance of the NHIF Manager and the directors of the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF).\nThe NHIF Manager exercises comprehensive control over compulsory health insurance activities and assigns inspections based on audit reports. Control over contracts with medical and dental care providers is performed by NHIF and RHIF officials, who can conduct surprise inspections, pre-payment control, and ex-post control. Experts from professional organizations may participate in inspections and provide written opinions.\nControl authorities have the power to check payments, examine accounting documents, ensure legal conformity of financial activities, investigate complaints, and verify compliance with accessibility and quality criteria. They can access information from employers, insured persons, and providers, but must maintain confidentiality.\nFinancial control over NHIF revenues from health insurance contributions is exercised by the National Revenue Agency. Control activities are conducted through planned and surprise inspections, and findings are documented in records provided to the inspected person and relevant authorities.\nDisputes arising from control findings can be referred to arbitration committees, which include representatives from the RHIF and professional organizations. The committees resolve disputes within one month, and penalties are imposed based on their resolutions. Penalties can be appealed in court.\nMedical and dental care providers who receive sums without legal grounds must repay the amounts. Written invitations for repayment are issued by the NHIF Governor or RHIF Director, and these invitations can be appealed.\nJoint checks by the RHIF, Medical Audit Executive Agency, regional healthcare inspectorates, and professional organizations ensure compliance with medical standards and good practices. Violations result in penalties imposed by the relevant control body.\nThe NHIF may conduct expert evaluations for high-value medical care or expensive medicinal products. Disputes related to contract performance between the RHIF and care providers are resolved in court if arbitration fails.\nThis framework ensures that the NHIF operates transparently and efficiently, maintaining high standards of healthcare services and accountability in Bulgaria’s health insurance system.\n\n\nSection XI. Issuance of Documents Required for Exercise of Health Insurance Entitlement according to Rules for Coordination of Social Security Schemes\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and the Ministry of Health in Bulgaria are responsible for issuing documents required for exercising health insurance entitlements according to the rules for coordination of social security schemes. These documents must be issued within thirty days of a request submitted by the interested parties to the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF). The Minister of Health, upon the NHIF Manager’s motion, establishes the procedure for issuing these documents.\nThe NHIF Manager or an authorized official issues European health insurance cards, which are valid for one year. For applicants under 18 years old, the card is valid until they turn 18, with a minimum validity of one year and a maximum of five years. For recipients of contributory-service and retirement-age pensions, the card is valid for ten years. For those receiving invalidity pensions, the card’s validity matches the pension period, with a minimum of ten years.\nA European health insurance card can be declared invalid if it is reported lost, stolen, or destroyed, if the insured person dies, or if the person loses entitlement to NHIF-covered medical care. The card will not be issued to individuals who have opted out of the health insurance system or lost their entitlement. The card is recommended for insured persons during temporary stays in EU Member States, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\n\n\nSection XII. Cross-border Healthcare\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and the Ministry of Health in Bulgaria are responsible for issuing documents required for exercising health insurance entitlements according to the rules for coordination of social security schemes. These documents must be issued within thirty days of a request submitted by the interested parties to the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF). The Minister of Health, upon the NHIF Manager’s motion, establishes the procedure for issuing these documents.\nThe NHIF Manager or an authorized official issues European health insurance cards, which are valid for one year. For applicants under 18 years old, the card is valid until they turn 18, with a minimum validity of one year and a maximum of five years. For recipients of contributory-service and retirement-age pensions, the card is valid for ten years. For those receiving invalidity pensions, the card’s validity matches the pension period, with a minimum of ten years.\nA European health insurance card can be declared invalid if it is reported lost, stolen, or destroyed, if the insured person dies, or if the person loses entitlement to NHIF-covered medical care. The card will not be issued to individuals who have opted out of the health insurance system or lost their entitlement. The card is recommended for insured persons during temporary stays in EU Member States, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nHealth insured persons in Bulgaria are entitled to access safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare. Cross-border healthcare refers to healthcare provided or prescribed in an EU Member State other than the person’s home country. This entitlement applies to healthcare included in the NHIF or Ministry of Health’s funded package. However, it does not cover organ transplants, long-term care for chronic conditions, national and municipal vaccination programs, or cases covered by existing social security coordination mechanisms or bilateral agreements.\nWhen seeking cross-border healthcare, insured persons must pay the medical facility in the treatment country and can claim reimbursement up to the amount the NHIF or Ministry of Health would pay for equivalent care in Bulgaria, but not exceeding the actual costs incurred. Reimbursement is not available for care provided by non-contracted institutions in Bulgaria.\nThe Minister of Health issues an ordinance detailing the terms, conditions, and procedures for exercising the right to cross-border healthcare. Prior authorization may be required for certain healthcare services, medicinal products, and medical products, especially those involving significant planning, high costs, or potential risks. The NHIF or Ministry of Health may refuse prior authorization if the treatment poses safety risks, can be provided in Bulgaria within a medically justifiable timeframe, or if the foreign provider raises quality or safety concerns. Refusals can be appealed under the Administrative Procedure Code.\nThe NHIF serves as the national contact point for cross-border healthcare, providing relevant information to patients and coordinating with other national contact points and the European Commission. The Ministry of Health, regional health inspectorates, the Agency for People with Disabilities, medical facilities, and professional organizations must provide necessary information to the NHIF to support its role as the national contact point."

    "text": "Глава първа на закона, озаглавена “Национална система за здравеопазване”, разглежда общите положения, свързани с опазването на здравето на гражданите. Законът урежда обществените отношения в тази област и определя здравето като национален приоритет, който се гарантира от държавата. Здравето се разбира като състояние на пълно физическо, психическо и социално благополучие, а не само като отсъствие на болести. За постигането на тази цел се прилагат редица принципи, сред които равнопоставеност при ползване на здравни услуги, осигуряване на достъпна и качествена здравна помощ с приоритет за уязвими групи като деца, бременни и майки на деца до една година, както и насоченост към промоция на здраве и профилактика на болестите.\nОсвен това, законът поставя акцент върху предотвратяването и намаляването на рисковете за здравето, свързани с неблагоприятното въздействие на факторите на жизнената среда. Особено внимание се отделя на здравната закрила на деца, бременни, майки на деца до една година, както и на лица с физически увреждания и психически разстройства. Държавата участва активно във финансирането на дейности, насочени към опазване на здравето, като това се осъществява чрез държавния бюджет и други финансови източници.\nДържавната здравна политика се ръководи и осъществява от Министерския съвет, който по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването одобрява Национална здравна стратегия. Тази стратегия се приема от Народното събрание и служи като основа за разработването на национални здравни програми и планове. Тези документи се основават на оценка на здравното състояние и здравните потребности на гражданите, както и на здравно-демографските тенденции и ресурсните възможности на националната система за здравеопазване. Националните здравни програми и планове се финансират предимно от държавния бюджет, като могат да бъдат подпомагани и от други източници.\nНационалната система за здравеопазване включва лечебни и здравни заведения, регулирани от съответните закони, както и държавни, общински и обществени органи и институции, които отговарят за организацията, управлението и контрола на дейностите, свързани с опазването и укрепването на здравето. Този раздел на закона подчертава важността на комплексния подход към здравето, като съчетава лечебни, профилактични и управленски аспекти, за да се гарантира ефективна и достъпна здравна система за всички граждани.\n\n\n\nРаздел II на закона, озаглавен “Органи на управление на националната система за здравеопазване”, определя структурата и функциите на основните институции, отговорни за управлението и контрола на здравната система в страната. Централната фигура в тази система е министърът на здравеопазването, който ръководи националната система за здравеопазване и осъществява контрол върху ключови области като опазването на здравето на гражданите, държавния здравен контрол, спешната медицинска помощ, трансфузионната хематология, стационарната психиатрична помощ, медико-социалните грижи за деца до тригодишна възраст, трансплантацията и здравната информация. Министърът също така отговаря за осигуряването и устойчивото развитие на здравните дейности в лечебните и здравните заведения, както и за медицинската експертиза.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването има задължението да представя годишен доклад в Народното събрание за състоянието на здравето на гражданите и изпълнението на Националната здравна стратегия. Този доклад се предоставя в срок до три месеца преди началото на бюджетната година. Освен това, министърът утвърждава разпределението на субсидиите от държавния бюджет за дейности, свързани със здравеопазването, с изключение на някои специфични области, като държавен здравен контрол и спешна медицинска помощ. Министърът също така осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху медицинската дейност на лечебните заведения, създадени към различни министерства, като Министерството на отбраната, Министерството на вътрешните работи, Министерството на правосъдието и Министерството на транспорта, информационните технологии и съобщенията.\nКъм министъра на здравеопазването е създаден Висш медицински съвет, който е консултативен орган, включващ представители на различни професионални организации и институции в областта на здравеопазването. Този съвет обсъжда и дава становища по ключови въпроси, свързани с приоритетите на Националната здравна стратегия, етичните проблеми на медицината и биомедицината, законопроекти и нормативни актове, годишния проектобюджет на здравеопазването, научните приоритети в медицината, годишния прием на студенти и специализанти, както и видовете специалности в областта на здравеопазването. Организацията и дейността на Висшия медицински съвет се уреждат с правилник, утвърден от министъра на здравеопазването.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването също така определя експертни съвети по медицински специалности или отделни медицински дейности, както и републикански консултанти по медицински специалности. Тези експертни съвети и консултанти предоставят консултации и становища по въпроси, свързани с медицинската практика и здравната система. Финансирането на техните дейности се осъществява в рамките на бюджета на Министерството на здравеопазването или от съответните лечебни заведения.\nНа регионално ниво, държавната здравна политика се осъществява и организира от регионални здравни инспекции, които са юридически лица на бюджетна издръжка към министъра на здравеопазването. Тези инспекции отговарят за държавен здравен контрол, контрол върху регистрацията и здравната дейност на лечебните и здравните заведения, планиране и организиране на медицинската експертиза, промоция на здравето и профилактика на болестите, събиране и анализ на здравна информация, както и координация на национални и международни здравни програми и проекти. Регионалните здравни инспекции също така проучват потребностите от медицински и немедицински специалисти и предлагат на министъра на здравеопазването броя на местата за следдипломно обучение по специалности.\nФинансирането на регионалните здравни инспекции се осъществява чрез субсидии от държавния бюджет и приходи от собствена дейност, включително държавни такси, глоби и имуществени санкции. Тези средства се използват за осъществяване на контролна дейност, профилактика на болестите, лабораторни анализи и изпитвания, както и за участие в национални и международни междулабораторни изпитвания.\nТази структура на управление на националната система за здравеопазване осигурява комплексен подход към опазването и укрепването на здравето на гражданите, като съчетава централното ръководство с регионална и местна инициатива и контрол.\n\n\n\nРаздел III на закона, озаглавен “Държавен здравен контрол”, определя механизмите и процедурите за защита на здравето на гражданите чрез систематичен и насочен контрол върху обекти, продукти, стоки и дейности, които имат значение за общественото здраве. Основната цел на държавния здравен контрол е да се гарантира спазването на установените здравни изисквания и норми, както и да се предотвратят рискове за здравето на населението.\nОрганите на държавния здравен контрол включват главния държавен здравен инспектор на Република България, регионалните здравни инспекции и Националния център по радиобиология и радиационна защита (НЦРРЗ). Главният държавен здравен инспектор се назначава от министър-председателя по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването и отговаря за организирането и ръководството на държавния здравен контрол. Той също така осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху звената по ведомствен здравен контрол към различни министерства, като Министерството на правосъдието, Министерството на транспорта, информационните технологии и съобщенията, Министерството на отбраната и Министерството на вътрешните работи.\nДържавният здравен контрол се извършва от държавни здравни инспектори, които са държавни служители в Министерството на здравеопазването, регионалните здравни инспекции и НЦРРЗ. Тези инспектори имат правото да осъществяват контрол без предварително уведомяване и да извършват проверки при постъпване на сигнали от граждани, държавни и общински органи, както и при наличие на данни за възникнали инциденти, които могат да застрашат здравето на населението.\nДържавните здравни инспектори имат широки правомощия, включително правото на свободен достъп до обекти, продукти и дейности, подлежащи на контрол, да изискват сведения и документи, да вземат проби за лабораторни анализи, да предписват отстраняване от работа на лица, които представляват опасност за здравето на околните, и да налагат задължителни хигиенни и противоепидемични мерки. Те също така могат да спират експлоатацията на обекти с обществено предназначение или реализацията на продукти и стоки, които не отговарят на здравните изисквания, както и да съставят актове за установяване на административни нарушения.\nРегионалните здравни инспекции осъществяват държавен здравен контрол чрез дейности, насочени към контрол на спазването на здравните изисквания за обекти с обществено предназначение, продукти и стоки със значение за здравето, дейности, които могат да засегнат здравето на гражданите, и фактори на жизнената среда. Те също така отговарят за надзора на заразните болести и контрола на спазването на забрани и ограничения за реклама и продажба на алкохолни напитки и тютюнопушене.\nАнализът на проби от продукти и стоки, както и на факторите на жизнената среда, се извършва в акредитирани лаборатории, определени със заповед на министъра на здравеопазването. Тези лаборатории трябва да отговарят на изискванията на международните стандарти за качество и компетентност. В случай, че лабораториите не са акредитирани, министърът може да определи временно лаборатории за анализ, при условие че те са започнали процедури за акредитация и прилагат система за гарантиране на качеството на лабораторната дейност.\nДоброволното плащане на глоби и имуществени санкции, наложени от органите на държавния здравен контрол, може да се извършва в Министерството на здравеопазването или в съответната регионална здравна инспекция. Този механизъм осигурява ефективност и прозрачност при налагането на санкции за нарушения на здравните изисквания.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV на закона, озаглавен “Здравни заведения”, определя структурата, функциите и дейността на здравните заведения, които са част от националната система за здравеопазване. Тези заведения имат за цел да опазват и укрепят здравето на гражданите чрез предоставяне на медицински и немедицински услуги. Здравните заведения включват национални центрове по проблемите на общественото здраве, Националната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК), здравните кабинети и оптиките.\nНационалните центрове по проблемите на общественото здраве са юридически лица на бюджетна издръжка, които се откриват, преобразуват и закриват с постановление на Министерския съвет по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването. Тези центрове се ръководят от директори, които се назначават след конкурс и се атестират на всеки три години. Директорите могат да бъдат освободени от длъжност в случай на отрицателна атестация. Националните центрове осъществяват широк спектър от дейности, включително проучвания, оценки, експертизи, анализи и прогнози в областта на общественото здраве, предотвратяване и ликвидиране на епидемии, организиране на медицинска помощ при бедствия, оценка на рисковете от факторите на жизнената среда, лабораторни изследвания, промоция на здраве и интегрирана профилактика на болестите, както и експертна и методическа помощ на други здравни и лечебни заведения.\nНационалната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК) е друго важно здравно заведение, което също е юридическо лице на бюджетна издръжка. НЕЛК се ръководи от директор, който се назначава след конкурс и се атестира на всеки три години. Основната дейност на НЕЛК е да осъществява експертни, контролно-методически и консултативни дейности, свързани с експертизата на работоспособността.\nЗдравните кабинети са структури, които се създават в детски градини, училища и социални услуги за резидентна грижа. Тези кабинети предоставят здравни услуги за деца и ученици, като изискванията за тяхното устройство и дейност се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Финансирането на здравните кабинети се осъществява от държавата и общините, като ежегодно се определят средствата за оборудване, консумативи и изпълнение на дейностите.\nОптиките са здравни заведения, които осъществяват дейности, свързани с здравната консултация по проблемите на зрението, корекция на зрението, изработка и продажба на очила и материали за очна оптика. Оптиките се ръководят от лица с висше образование в областта на медицината или с професионална квалификация като техник по очна оптика или оптик-оптометрист. Здравните консултации в оптиките могат да се осъществяват само при наличие на договор с лекар, специализиран в очни болести.\nОткриването на оптики се извършва по определен ред, а изискванията за тяхното устройство и дейност се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Този раздел на закона гарантира, че здравните заведения функционират ефективно и в съответствие с установените стандарти, като същевременно предоставят необходимите здравни услуги на гражданите.\n\n\n\nРаздел V на закона, озаглавен “Здравна информация и документация”, регулира събирането, обработката, използването и съхраняването на здравна информация, която включва лични данни, свързани със здравословното състояние, физическото и психическото развитие на лицата, както и друга информация, съдържаща се в медицински рецепти, предписания, протоколи, удостоверения и друга медицинска документация. Този раздел гарантира защита на личните данни на пациентите, като същевременно осигурява необходимите механизми за обмен на информация между здравните институции и специалисти.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения, регионалните здравни инспекции, лекарите, лекарите по дентална медицина, фармацевтите и други медицински специалисти, както и немедицинските специалисти с висше образование, работещи в националната система за здравеопазване, са задължени да събират, обработват, използват и съхраняват здравна информация. Формите и съдържанието на медицинската документация, както и условията и редът за нейната обработка, използване и съхранение, се определят с наредби на министъра на здравеопазването, съгласувани с Националния статистически институт.\nЗдравната информация може да бъде предоставяна на трети лица в определени случаи, като например при продължаване на лечението в друго лечебно заведение, при заплаха за здравето или живота на други лица, при идентификация на човешки труп или за установяване на причините за смъртта, за нуждите на държавния здравен контрол, медицинската експертиза, общественото осигуряване, медицинската статистика или медицински научни изследвания. В случаите, когато здравната информация се предоставя за нуждите на застраховател, това се извършва само при наличие на лиценз по определените в закона категории.\nЛицата, които събират и обработват здравна информация, са длъжни да осигурят нейната защита от неправомерен достъп. Пациентите имат право да получат здравната информация, отнасяща се до тяхното здравословно състояние, включително копия от медицинските им документи. Те могат да упълномощят писмено друго лице да се запознае с медицинските им документи и да направи копия от тях. В случай на смърт на пациента, неговите наследници и роднини до четвърта степен включително имат право да се запознаят със здравната информация за починалия и да направят копия от медицинските му документи.\nМедицинските специалисти и служители в лечебните заведения нямат право да разгласяват информация за пациента, която е получена при изпълнение на служебните им задължения. Това гарантира поверителността на здравната информация и защитата на личните данни на пациентите.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването, разпоредителите с бюджети към него и лечебните заведения, които поддържат регистри с национално значение, имат право на безвъзмезден достъп до информационните регистри, изградени и поддържани с бюджетни средства. Това осигурява ефективност и прозрачност при управлението на здравната информация и нейното използване за нуждите на националната система за здравеопазване.\n\n\n\nРаздел VI на закона, озаглавен “Национална здравноинформационна система”, въвежда създаването и функционирането на Националната здравноинформационна система (НЗИС), която се администрира и поддържа от Министерството на здравеопазването. Тази система има за цел да събира, обработва и съхранява информация за здравното състояние на населението чрез създаване и поддържане на електронен здравен запис за всеки гражданин. НЗИС се основава на принципите за актуалност и точност на данните, осигуряване на подходяща среда за обмен на данни, регламентиран достъп до данните при спазване на закона, както и оперативна съвместимост и информационна сигурност.\nМедицинските и немедицинските специалисти в лечебните и здравните заведения са длъжни да създават електронен здравен запис за всяка извършена дейност, като изготвената здравна документация се изпраща към НЗИС като електронен документ, подписан с квалифициран електронен подпис. Електронният здравен запис представлява съвкупност от електронни документи за всяка една от извършените дейности, включително тези, извършени от разстояние, които са относими към здравословното състояние на гражданина, независимо от неговия здравноосигурителен статус и източника на финансиране на съответната дейност. Лечебните и здравните заведения нямат право да изискват заплащане от пациентите за извършване на дейностите по създаване на електронния здравен запис.\nНЗИС включва електронните здравни записи на гражданите, както и всички регистри, информационни бази от данни и системи, които се водят от Министерството на здравеопазването, неговите второстепенни разпоредители с бюджет, лечебни и здравни заведения, Националната здравноосигурителна каса и застрахователните дружества. За нуждите на системата, първичните администратори на данни предоставят автоматизирано на министъра на здравеопазването безвъзмездно данни за гражданската регистрация и валидността на българските лични документи, както и информация за здравноосигурителния статус на физическите лица.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения подават информация в Министерството на здравеопазването за създаване и поддържане на електронните здравни записи на гражданите. Видът на информацията, начинът на нейното предоставяне, както и условията и редът за предоставянето й се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Също така, с наредба се определят условията и редът за водене на регистрите, информационните бази от данни и системи, включени в НЗИС.\nПраво на безвъзмезден достъп до НЗИС имат гражданите – до информацията в техния електронен здравен запис, лечебните и здравните заведения, Националната здравноосигурителна каса, застрахователните дружества, държавни органи и съсловни организации на медицински специалисти. Предоставянето на достъп до информацията в електронния здравен запис на гражданина на трети лица се извършва само след изрично писмено съгласие при условия и по ред, определени в наредбата.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения не носят отговорност за неверни, неактуални или неправилно въведени от други лица данни в регистрите и информационните системи. При противоречие между документ на хартиен носител и електронен здравен запис, предимство има записът в НЗИС, освен ако няма обективни причини, които поставят под съмнение автентичността на електронния документ.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването извършва оценка на специализирания софтуер, чрез който се обменят данни със системата, относно лесното му използване и съответствието му с изискванията на наредбата. Производителите на специализирания софтуер го предоставят на лица, определени от министъра на здравеопазването, безплатно за целите на оценяването. Министърът утвърждава и публикува списък на оценените специализирани софтуери на интернет страницата на Министерството на здравеопазването.\nОсвен това, министърът на здравеопазването изгражда и поддържа система за управление на графиците на работа с пациенти на медицинските специалисти в лечебните заведения като част от НЗИС. Медицинските специалисти използват тази система доброволно и безплатно.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлава втора на закона, озаглавена “Дейности по опазване на здравето”, разглежда общите положения, свързани с планирането, разработването и провеждането на политики, насочени към опазване на здравето на гражданите. Този раздел установява рамката за дейности, които имат за цел да осигурят здравословна жизнена среда, да насърчават здравословен начин на живот и да провеждат здравна профилактика.\nДържавните и общинските органи и институции са отговорни за планирането и провеждането на политики, насочени към опазване на здравето. Тези политики включват осигуряване на здравословна жизнена среда, обучение за здравословен начин на живот и здравна профилактика. Общините могат да подпомагат дейността си в областта на здравната профилактика чрез здравни медиатори, които помагат при провеждането на политики сред населението и при предоставянето на медицинска помощ. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба изискванията за дейността на здравните медиатори. Освен това, дейността по здравна профилактика може да се подпомага и от юридически лица с нестопанска цел, които имат доказан опит в съответната област, при условия и по ред, определени с наредба.\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни системно да извършват профилактични прегледи и диспансеризация с цел опазване на здравето и работоспособността на гражданите. Лицата с повишен здравен риск или със заболявания подлежат на диспансеризация, която включва редовни прегледи и наблюдение за ранно откриване и предотвратяване на заболявания. Условията, редът и финансирането за извършване на профилактичните прегледи и диспансеризацията, както и списъкът на заболяванията, при които се извършва диспансеризация, се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\n\n\n\nРаздел II на закона, озаглавен “Осигуряване на здравословна жизнена среда”, установява мерките и механизмите за опазване на здравето на гражданите чрез осигуряване на безопасна и здравословна жизнена среда. Този раздел включва разпоредби, свързани с контрола на факторите на жизнената среда, здравните изисквания за обекти, продукти и дейности, както и процедурите за налагане на мерки при нарушения.\nДържавата, общините, юридическите и физическите лица са длъжни да осигуряват опазването на жизнената среда от вредни биологични, химични, физични и социални фактори, които могат да засегнат здравето на гражданите. Министърът на здравеопазването ръководи националната система за анализ, оценка и контрол на шума, замърсителите в питейните води и нейонизиращите лъчения в урбанизираните територии и обществените сгради. Той анализира и оценява факторите на жизнената среда на национално ниво и предлага мерки за ограничаване на вредното им въздействие върху здравето на гражданите. Регионалните здравни инспекции наблюдават, анализират и оценяват факторите на жизнената среда на територията на областта и предлагат мерки за ограничаване на вредното им въздействие.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването организира епидемиологични проучвания за установяване на зависимост между замърсяването на околната среда и здравното състояние на населението. Министерският съвет и общините приемат и финансират програми за провеждане на дейности, свързани с опазване, укрепване и възстановяване на здравето на гражданите в населени места, където е установена такава зависимост.\nЗдравните изисквания за обекти с обществено предназначение, продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека, както и максимално допустимите нива на факторите на жизнената среда, се определят с наредби на министъра на здравеопазването. Освен това, здравните изисквания към лицата, работещи в детските заведения, социалните и интегрираните здравно-социални услуги, водоснабдителните обекти, предприятията за производство и търговия с храни, бръснарските, фризьорските и козметичните салони, също се определят с наредба.\nОрганите на държавния здравен контрол участват в експертните съвети по устройство на територията, съгласуват устройствени планове и участват в оценката на инвестиционните проекти. Всеки, който открие обект с обществено предназначение, е длъжен да уведоми съответната регионална здравна инспекция за това, като посочва адреса на обекта, видовете дейности, които се извършват, и данни за лицето, което упражнява дейността. Регионалните здравни инспекции извършват проверка за спазване на здравните изисквания в обекта в срок до един месец от уведомяването.\nПри неспазване на здравните изисквания държавните здравни инспектори издават задължителни предписания и определят срок за отстраняване на нарушенията. В случай на неизпълнение на предписанията, директорът на регионалната здравна инспекция издава заповед за спиране на експлоатацията на обекта или на съответната дейност. При непосредствена опасност за живота и здравето на хората, държавните здравни инспектори могат да спират незабавно експлоатацията на обекта или дейността.\nЗа издаване на здравен сертификат за износ на продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека, заинтересованото лице подава заявление до главния държавен здравен инспектор, като прилага необходимите документи. Здравният сертификат се издава в срок до 15 работни дни от подаване на заявлението. В Министерството на здравеопазването се създава и поддържа регистър на издадените здравни сертификати за износ на продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека.\nПри съмнение за безопасността на продукти и стоки, държавният здравен инспектор издава предписание за спиране на реализацията им и взема проби за лабораторен анализ. При потвърждаване на безопасността на продуктите, държавният здравен инспектор отменя предписанието за спиране на реализацията. В случай че продуктите и стоките не съответстват на здравните изисквания, се издава заповед за преработка, използване за други цели или унищожаване на продуктите и стоките.\nУсловията и редът за вземане на проби и провеждане на лабораторни изследвания се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Физическите и юридическите лица са длъжни да изпълняват задължителните предписания на държавните здравни инспектори и заповедите на органите за държавен здравен контрол. Принудителните административни мерки, наложени по реда на този раздел, се обжалват по административен ред.\n\n\n\nРаздел III на закона, озаглавен “Здравни изисквания към козметичните продукти”, установява рамката за регулиране на козметичните продукти, които се предоставят на пазара, с цел гарантиране на тяхната безопасност за човешкото здраве. Този раздел се основава на разпоредбите на Регламент (ЕО) № 1223/2009 на Европейския парламент и на Съвета, който урежда изискванията за козметичните продукти в Европейския съюз.\nКозметичните продукти трябва да бъдат безопасни за човешкото здраве, когато се използват при нормални или разумно предвидими условия. Това включва спазване на добрата производствена практика, извършване на оценка на безопасността, съставяне на досие с информация за продукта, както и спазване на изискванията за етикетиране, нотификация и ограничения за веществата в състава на козметичните продукти. Информацията на етикета трябва да бъде предоставена на български език, включително данни за производителя, състава, срока на годност и инструкции за употреба.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването и органите на държавния здравен контрол са компетентни органи, отговорни за контрола на козметичните продукти. Те периодично преразглеждат и оценяват дейността си по отношение на контрола на козметични продукти, като резултатите от тази оценка се съобщават на другите държави – членки на Европейския съюз и на Европейската комисия, както и се оповестяват публично.\nКлиниката по токсикология на Университетската многопрофилна болница “Н. И. Пирогов” е определена като токсикологичен център, отговорен за обработването на информацията, предоставена от Европейската комисия, и за осигуряване на защита на поверителността на тази информация.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба подробни правила за представяне на информацията относно козметичните продукти, които не са предварително пакетирани или се пакетират в момента на продажбата им по искане на потребителя. Освен това, с наредба се определят изискванията за ефикасността на продуктите, предназначени за защита от слънчевото лъчение, както и химичните методи за проверка на състава на козметичните продукти.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV на закона, озаглавен “Дейности за въздействие върху рискови за здравето фактори”, установява мерки за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ), както и за предотвратяване на тяхната злоупотреба, особено сред младежите под 18 години. Този раздел включва както национални, така и регионални програми, насочени към промоция на здравословен начин на живот и осигуряване на достъп до медицинска помощ и социална защита за засегнатите лица.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването и други компетентни държавни органи съвместно с неправителствените организации създават условия за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ) сред младежите. Тези дейности се осъществяват чрез национални програми, които включват промотивни и профилактични инициативи, както и осигуряване на достъп до медицинска помощ и социална защита. Средствата за финансиране на тези програми се извличат от акцизите върху тютюневите изделия и спиртните напитки, като една стотна от тези постъпления се използва за тази цел.\nОбщините също са задължени да приемат и осъществяват регионални програми за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ) сред младежите. Тези програми имат за цел да намалят рисковете за здравето, свързани с тези вещества, и да насърчат здравословен начин на живот.\nЗаконът забранява продажбата на алкохолни напитки на лица под 18 години, в пияно състояние, на територията на детските градини, училищата, общежитията за ученици, лечебните заведения, както и по време на спортни прояви и обществени мероприятия, организирани за деца и ученици. Също така, забранява се продажбата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) на физически лица, с изключение на търговци, чиято дейност включва продажбата на този продукт, както и на територията на детските градини, училищата, общежитията за ученици, лечебните заведения, спортни прояви и обществени мероприятия, организирани за деца и ученици.\nПряката реклама на спиртни напитки е забранена, а непряката реклама на спиртни напитки и рекламата на вино и бира не може да бъде насочена към лица под 18 години, да използва лица под 18 години като участници, да свързва употребата на алкохол със спортни постижения или управление на превозни средства, или да съдържа неверни твърдения относно полза за здравето. Непряката реклама на спиртни напитки не може да се излъчва в радио- и телевизионни предавания преди 22:00 часа.\nЗабранява се и рекламата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) в онлайн платформи, като за преустановяване на такава реклама се разпорежда премахването ѝ със заповед от председателя на Комисията за защита на потребителите.\nТютюнопушенето е забранено в закритите обществени места, включително в помещенията с обособени работни места и спомагателни помещения. По изключение се допуска тютюнопушене в обособени самостоятелни помещения на летищата, които трябва да отговарят на строги изисквания за вентилация и изолация. Забранява се и тютюнопушенето на открити обществени места, като детски градини, училища, площадки за игра и спортни обекти по време на прояви. Също така, забранява се употребата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) на открити и закрити обществени места, с изключение на медицински цели и случаи, предвидени в Закона за храните.\n\n\n\nРаздел V, озаглавен “Надзор на заразните болести”, установява мерките и механизмите за предотвратяване и контрол на разпространението на заразни болести в страната. Този раздел включва разпоредби за граничен здравен контрол, задължителни имунизации, регистрация и отчет на заразни болести, както и мерки за справяне с извънредни епидемични ситуации.\nГраничният здравен контрол се извършва при необходимост за предотвратяване на разпространението на особено опасни заразни болести. Условията и редът за провеждане на този контрол се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\nЗа предпазване на гражданите от заразни болести се извършват задължителни имунизации. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба лицата, които подлежат на имунизации, както и реда, начина и сроковете за извършване на планови, целеви и препоръчителни имунизации. При възникване на извънредна епидемична обстановка или значителен спад в имунизационното покритие, министърът може да разпореди задължителни имунизации за определени групи от населението, включително с препарати, които не са включени в имунизационния календар.\nБолните от заразни болести, контактните с тях лица и заразоносителите подлежат на регистрация, задължително съобщаване и отчет. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба болестите, които подлежат на регистрация, както и реда за надзор, ранно оповестяване и предприемане на мерки при случаи на биотероризъм или поява на нови, непознати заразни болести. Освен това, министърът определя реда за изследване, съобщаване и отчет на заразеност с вируса на синдрома на придобита имунна недостатъчност (СПИН) и реда за съобщаване, проучване и регистриране на хранителни заболявания.\nЛица, болни от и заразоносители на особено опасни заразни болести като антракс, бруцелоза, дифтерия, ебола, холера и чума, подлежат на задължителна изолация. Контактните с тях лица подлежат на задължителна карантина. Министърът на здравеопазването може да разпореди задължителна изолация и карантина за други заразни болести, въз основа на оценка на епидемичния риск. Задължителната изолация и карантина се извършват с предписание, издадено от регионалната здравна инспекция, и подлежат на предварително изпълнение.\nПри непосредствена опасност за живота и здравето на гражданите от епидемично разпространение на заразна болест, Министерският съвет може да обяви извънредна епидемична обстановка. В такива случаи, министърът на здравеопазването въвежда временни противоепидемични мерки, включително забрана за влизане на територията на страната, ограничаване на придвижването и спиране на работа на обекти с обществено предназначение. Тези мерки се координират от областните управители и се финансират от държавния бюджет.\nФизическите и юридическите лица, които извършват дейности по дезинфекция, дезинсекция и дератизация, са длъжни да уведомят Министерството на здравеопазването за започването на дейността си. Условията и редът за извършване на тези дейности се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването и министъра на земеделието и храните.\n\n\n\nРазделът, посветен на защитата на лицата от въздействието на йонизиращи лъчения, установява изчерпателна рамка за осигуряване на радиационна безопасност и предотвратяване на рискове за здравето на гражданите и работниците, изложени на такива лъчения. Основната цел е да се гарантира, че използването на източници на йонизиращи лъчения, както в медицински, така и в промишлени или други контексти, се извършва при строго спазване на установените принципи и изисквания за радиационна защита.\nЗащитата включва контрол на факторите на работната и жизнената среда, насочен към намаляване на облъчването на лицата. Това включва медицинско наблюдение на лицата, работещи с източници на йонизиращи лъчения, като се оценява тяхната медицинска пригодност за изпълнение на професионални задължения. Дозиметричният контрол е друг ключов елемент, който позволява да се определи вътрешното и външното облъчване на тези лица. Освен това, се извършва оценка на радиационния риск за населението като цяло или за определени групи, като се вземат предвид различни фактори, свързани с изложението на йонизиращи лъчения.\nМедицинското наблюдение на лицата, работещи с източници на йонизиращи лъчения, се осъществява от квалифицирани лекари, включително специалисти от Националния център по радиобиология и радиационна защита (НЦРРЗ). Тези лекари оценяват медицинската пригодност на работниците и осигуряват необходимата поддръжка в случай на радиационни аварии или други извънредни ситуации. В случай на спор относно медицинската пригодност, може да се подаде жалба пред специална комисия, която се произнася окончателно по въпроса.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването има правомощията да издава наредби, които уреждат различни аспекти на радиационната защита. Това включва условията и реда за медицинско осигуряване в случай на радиационна авария, здравните норми при работа в среда на йонизиращи лъчения, както и изискванията за защита на лицата при хронично облъчване. Освен това, се установяват правила за индивидуален дозиметричен контрол и за осигуряване на безопасност при медицинско облъчване.\nЗа извършване на дейности по изпитване на качеството на медицинската радиологична апаратура е необходимо юридическо лице или едноличен търговец да бъде вписан в специален регистър. Този регистър се поддържа от Министерството на здравеопазването и включва информация за лицата, които извършват тези дейности, както и за техните квалификации и опит. Вписването в регистъра е задължително и се извършва след подаване на заявление и предоставяне на необходимите документи. В случай на нередовности или предоставяне на неверни данни, министърът на здравеопазването може да откаже вписването.\nМедицинското облъчване с източници на йонизиращи лъчения е разрешено само при определени условия, като диагностика, лечение или здравен скрининг. В случай на деца или бременни жени, облъчването се извършва само при строги условия и само от специалисти с допълнително обучение. Пациентите имат право да откажат облъчване по всяко време, а медицинските специалисти са длъжни да предоставят пълна информация за рисковете и ползите от процедурата.\nПри радиационни аварии или други извънредни ситуации, органите на държавния здравен контрол могат да разрешат извършването на дейности от доброволци, дори при превишаване на установените граници на облъчване. В такива случаи, лицата подлежат на незабавно медицинско изследване и наблюдение.\nМинистерството на здравеопазването създава и поддържа регистър на лицата, работещи или работили в среда на йонизиращи лъчения. Този регистър служи за проследяване на здравното състояние на тези лица и за оценка на дългосрочните ефекти от излагането на радиация.\n\n\n\nРаздел VII се занимава с мерките за защита на здравето на гражданите при извършване на дейности, свързани с азбест и азбестосъдържащи материали. За да се извършат дейности по разрушаване или отстраняване на такива материали от сгради, конструкции, предприятия, инсталации или кораби, е необходимо да се получи разрешение от директора на регионалната здравна инспекция, на чиято територия се намира обектът. За получаване на разрешението, заинтересованото лице трябва да подаде заявление, план за работа, списък на ангажираните работници и служители, както и удостоверение за обучение на персонала. Планът за работа трябва да включва подробна информация за вида и продължителността на дейностите, мястото на извършване, използваните методи, личните предпазни средства, оборудването за защита на работниците и околната среда, както и мерките за доказване на липсата на риск след приключване на дейностите.\nОсвен това, планът трябва да предвижда отстраняването на азбеста преди прилагането на техники за разрушаване, освен ако това би довело до по-голям риск за работниците. Обучението на персонала се извършва съгласно условията, определени в наредбата по Закона за здравословни и безопасни условия на труд. Важно е да се отбележи, че разрешение не се изисква при извършване на аварийно-спасителни дейности.\nСлед подаване на заявлението, директорът на регионалната здравна инспекция изпраща документите за становище на регионалната инспекция по околната среда и водите в тридневен срок. Регионалната инспекция по околната среда и водите трябва да даде становище в 14-дневен срок, като при липса на становище в този срок се счита, че документите са съгласувани без забележки. Директорът на здравната инспекция уведомява заявителя за препоръките и, ако е необходимо, заявителят трябва да представи коригиран план за работа в срок от един месец. Разрешението се издава в срок от 5 дни след получаване на положително становище или на коригирания план. В случай на неизпълнение на препоръките, директорът на здравната инспекция може да откаже издаването на разрешение с мотивирано решение.\n\n\n\nРаздел VIII регулира курортните ресурси и курортите, като дефинира курортните ресурси като минерални води, лечебни пелоиди (лечебна кал), крайбрежната плажна ивица, морската вода и местности с благоприятни биоклиматични условия за профилактика, лечение и рехабилитация. Лечебните пелоиди включват лиманно-лагунни тини, изворни тини, езерна утаечна кал, торф и бентонитови глини. За ползването на минерални води за различни цели, като питейни, лечебни или рекреационни, министърът на здравеопазването или оправомощеното от него лице издава балнеологична оценка, която удостоверява състава, свойствата и начина на приложение на минералната вода. Тази оценка се издава на базата на предложение от директора на басейновата дирекция или кмета на общината, като се прилага резюме за хидрогеоложките условия и експлоатационните характеристики на водовземното съоръжение. Балнеологичната оценка се основава на анализи и проучвания, включващи хидрогеоложки условия, физични, химични, радиологични и микробиологични характеристики, както и фармакологичното и клинично въздействие на водата. Оценката е валидна за 10 години и може да бъде подновена по същия ред, като предложението за подновяване трябва да бъде подадено не по-късно от 6 месеца преди изтичането на срока ѝ. Всички издадени балнеологични оценки се публикуват на интернет страницата на Министерството на здравеопазването.\nКурортите се определят като урбанизирани територии с обявени курортни ресурси и възможности за изграждане на обекти за лечение, рехабилитация, отдих и туризъм. Обявяването на курортите се извършва по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването с решение на Министерския съвет, което се обнародва в “Държавен вестник”. Министърът на здравеопазването, в сътрудничество с други министри, определя с наредби условията и реда за обявяване, използване и опазване на курортните ресурси, зони и територии, както и за класификацията на курортите. Лечебните заведения имат приоритетно право да използват минерални води и лечебна кал за своята дейност, дори когато тези ресурси се отдават по Закона за концесиите.\nОсвен това, за опазване на живота и здравето на хората и превенция на водния травматизъм, се извършва обезопасяване на водните площи и басейните за обществено ползване, като се организира водноспасителна дейност. Изискванията за тази дейност и обезопасяването се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлава трета, раздел I от закона регулира достъпността и качеството на медицинската помощ в Република България. Медицинската помощ се осъществява чрез прилагане на утвърдени от медицинската наука и практика методи и технологии, като това изискване се отнася и за медицински дейности, извършвани в чужбина по отношение на български граждани. Качеството на медицинската помощ се основава на медицински стандарти, утвърдени съгласно Закона за лечебните заведения, и на Правилата за добра медицинска практика, приети от съсловните организации на лекарите. Всеки български гражданин има право на достъпна медицинска помощ, която трябва да бъде своевременна, достатъчна и качествена, с приоритет за деца, бременни и майки на деца до 1 година. Основните принципи включват равнопоставеност, сътрудничество между лечебните заведения и зачитане на правата на пациента. Условията и редът за осъществяване на това право се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\nИзвън обхвата на задължителното здравно осигуряване, българските граждани имат право на медицински услуги, свързани със спешни състояния, интензивно лечение на здравно неосигурени лица, профилактични прегледи, стационарна психиатрична помощ, лечение със субституиращи програми, трансплантация на органи и други специфични медицински дейности. Тези услуги се финансират от държавния бюджет и общинските бюджети. Децата до 18 години имат право на медицинска помощ извън обхвата на задължителното здравно осигуряване, включително заплащане на медицински изделия, лекарствени продукти и диетични храни за специални медицински цели. Лечението на онкологични и редки заболявания, започнало преди навършване на 18 години, продължава да се финансира и след тази възраст.\nЧужденците с дългосрочно или постоянно пребиваване, бежанци, лица с хуманитарен статут и право на убежище, както и временно закриляни лица, имат право на медицинска помощ при същите условия като българските граждани. Чуждестранните студенти и докторанти, обучаващи се в България, също се ползват с медицинска помощ по същия ред. Чужденците, които пребивават краткосрочно или транзитно в страната, са длъжни да имат здравна осигуровка или застраховка, покриваща разходите за лечение. Изключение правят лицата, за които се прилагат правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност.\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни да осигурят на пациентите необходимите медицински изделия, като те се предоставят чрез болничните аптеки. Ако медицинските изделия не се заплащат от Националната здравноосигурителна каса или държавния бюджет, пациентите ги заплащат по цените на лечебното заведение. Гражданите на други държави – членки на Европейския съюз, които получават здравно обслужване в България, се ползват със същите методи и стандарти като българските граждани и заплащат стойността на услугите по същите цени.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона регулира правата и задълженията на пациента. Пациент е всяко лице, което е потърсило или на което се оказва медицинска помощ, като регистрацията му като пациент става с информирано съгласие, освен в случаите, предвидени със закон. На пациента се оказва здравна помощ независимо от възраст, пол, произход, език, национална, расова или политическа принадлежност, образование, убеждения, културно равнище, сексуална ориентация, лично, обществено или материално положение, увреждане и вид на заболяването.\nПациентът има право на зачитане на гражданските, политическите, икономическите, социалните, културните и религиозните му права, както и на достъпна и качествена здравна помощ. Той има право на повече от едно медицинско становище относно диагнозата, лечението и прогнозата на заболяването, както и на защита на данните, свързани с неговото здравословно състояние. Пациентът има право на ясна и достъпна информация за здравословното си състояние и методите за лечение, както и на достъп до модерни методи на лечение, предотвратяване на болката и страданието, и до медицинската документация. При хоспитализация пациентът има право да бъде посещаван от личния си лекар, да приема или отказва посетители, да ползва услугите на психотерапевт, юрист и свещенослужител, както и да получи информация за цената на медицинските услуги и лекарствените продукти.\nЗа защита на правата на пациента към министъра на здравеопазването се създава Обществен съвет по правата на пациента, който наблюдава и анализира дейностите, свързани с правата на пациента, изготвя доклади и предложения за промени в нормативната уредба. Представителни организации за защита на правата на пациентите могат да участват в работата на консултативни органи и да получават информация за проекти на нормативни актове.\nМедицинските дейности се осъществяват след изразено информирано съгласие от пациента. При непълнолетни или недееспособни лица съгласието се изразява от родител, настойник или попечител, освен в случаите, предвидени със закон. Пациентът има право да откаже предложената медицинска помощ, като отказът се удостоверява в медицинската документация. В случаите, когато е застрашен животът на пациента, ръководителят на лечебното заведение може да вземе решение за осъществяване на животоспасяващо лечение.\nПациентът има право да бъде информиран за здравословното си състояние, планираните лечебни дейности и рисковете, свързани с тях, както и да откаже да бъде информиран, освен когато здравословното му състояние застрашава други лица. Той може да подава жалби и сигнали до регионалната здравна инспекция при нарушаване на правата му, като регионалната здравна инспекция е длъжна да провери жалбата в 7-дневен срок и да предприеме съответните действия.\nПациентът е длъжен да се грижи за собственото си здраве, да не уврежда здравето на другите, да съдейства на медицинските специалисти и да спазва установения ред в лечебните заведения. При нелечими заболявания пациентът има право на палиативни медицински грижи, които включват медицинско наблюдение, здравни грижи и морална подкрепа. На територията на Република България не се прилага евтаназия.\nПри смърт на пациент в лечебно заведение се извършва патологоанатомична аутопсия, освен ако близките на починалия изрично поискат освобождаване от аутопсия. В случаите на смърт на дете, настанено извън семейството, аутопсията се извършва само ако детето е починало в лечебно заведение за болнична помощ.\n\n\n\nРаздел III от закона се занимава с медицинската помощ при спешни състояния. Държавата организира и финансира система за оказване на такава помощ, като спешно състояние се определя като остро или внезапно възникнала промяна в здравето на човека, която изисква незабавна медицинска намеса. Целта на медицинската помощ при спешни състояния е да предотврати смърт, тежки или необратими увреждания на жизнено важни органи и системи, както и усложнения при родилки, които застрашават здравето и живота на майката или плода.\nВсяко лице, намиращо се на мястото на инцидента, е длъжно да информира най-близкия център за спешна медицинска помощ, лечебно заведение или полицейско управление. Лечебните заведения са задължени да извършат необходимите медицински дейности при пациент в спешно състояние, независимо от неговото гражданство, адрес или здравноосигурителен статут. Ако лечебното заведение не може да осигури необходимия обем дейности, пациентът се транспортира до най-близкото подходящо лечебно заведение, при условие че състоянието му позволява това. При пренастаняване на пациента се използват всички медицински документи, обобщени в епикриза.\nТранспортирането на пациент не се допуска, ако то създава неоправдано висок риск за здравето и живота му. Това гарантира, че пациентите в спешни състояния получават необходимата помощ, като се избягват допълнителни рискове, свързани с транспортирането.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV от закона регулира медицинската експертиза, която включва установяване на временна неработоспособност, вида и степента на увреждане, степента на трайно намалена работоспособност и потвърждаване на професионални болести. Медицинската експертиза се организира и ръководи от министъра на здравеопазването и регионалните здравни инспекции. При извършване на експертиза се прави преценка и за възможността на лицето да се яви пред разследващите или съдебни органи, ако е необходимо. Видът и степента на увреждане се определят в проценти спрямо възможностите на здравия човек, като при определени дефинитивни състояния степента на трайно намалена работоспособност може да бъде определена пожизнено.\nМедицинската експертиза включва експертиза на временната неработоспособност, вида и степента на увреждане и трайно намалената работоспособност. Експертизата на временната неработоспособност се извършва от лекуващия лекар, лекарски консултативни комисии (ЛКК), териториални експертни лекарски комисии (ТЕЛК) и Националната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК). Експертизата на вида и степента на увреждане и трайно намалената работоспособност се извършва от ТЕЛК и НЕЛК, като при децата до 16 години участва и специалист по детски болести. Срокът за извършване на експертизата е три месеца от подаване на заявлението.\nОрганите на медицинската експертиза представят данни за издадените болнични листове и решенията по обжалването им в Националния осигурителен институт. Лекарските консултативни комисии се разкриват и закриват от директорите на регионалните здравни инспекции, а териториалните експертни лекарски комисии са структурни звена на лечебните заведения. В съставите на ТЕЛК и НЕЛК работят лекари с призната специалност и не по-малко от 5 години трудов стаж. При извършване на експертиза не може да участва лекар, който е бил ангажиран с обжалваното решение или е в роднинска връзка с освидетелстваното лице.\nНационалната експертна лекарска комисия създава и поддържа информационна база данни за всички лица, преминали през ТЕЛК и НЕЛК, която включва данни за експертните решения, диагнози, извършени медико-диагностични дейности и други данни, от значение за трайно намалената работоспособност и вида и степента на увреждане. Тази база данни се използва за планиране на дейности, свързани с образованието, медицинската и социалната рехабилитация, трудовата заетост и оценка на здравния статус на населението.\nКонтрол върху медицинската експертиза се осъществява от Националния съвет по медицинска експертиза, министъра на здравеопазването, министъра на труда и социалната политика, НЗОК, НОИ и регионалните здравни инспекции. Регионалните съвети извършват проверки на експертните решения за временна неработоспособност и контролират дейността на лекуващите лекари, ЛКК и ТЕЛК. Обжалванията на експертните решения се подават пред съответните органи в определени срокове, като решенията на НЕЛК могат да бъдат обжалвани пред административния съд.\nРешенията на органите на медицинската експертиза са задължителни за всички лица, органи и организации в страната, след като редът за обжалване е изчерпан. Органите на медицинската експертиза могат да отменят или изменят неправилни решения на по-долустоящите органи, а ръководителят на НЕЛК може да разпореди преразглеждане на противоречиви решения.\n\n\n\nРаздел V от закона регулира медицинското осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи. Управлението, организацията и ресурсното осигуряване на здравната помощ в такива ситуации се осъществяват от министъра на здравеопазването, главния държавен здравен инспектор, директора на Националния център по радиационна и радиологична защита (НЦРРЗ), директорите на регионалните здравни инспекции, лечебните и здравните заведения. Тези органи провеждат дейността си в тясно взаимодействие с централната и местната власт, Министерството на вътрешните работи, неправителствени организации и Българския Червен кръст.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването разработва планове за медицинско осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи, които се утвърждават от Министерския съвет. На базата на тези планове се създават условия за медицинска сортировка, първична обработка, лечение, рехабилитация и медицинска експертиза на пострадалите. Те формират и подготвят органи за управление и екипи за медицинска помощ, осигуряват защитата на стационарно болните и медицинския персонал, организират противоепидемични и хигиенни дейности, формират запаси за ресурсно осигуряване и организират обучение на медицинските специалисти и населението. Финансовото осигуряване на тези дейности се осъществява от държавния бюджет.\nЗа осъществяване на медицинското осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи към директора на регионалната здравна инспекция се създава съвет за медицинско осигуряване, който включва представители на регионалната здравна инспекция, директорите на лечебните заведения за болнична помощ, центъра за спешна медицинска помощ, областната администрация и общините в съответния регион. Този съвет приема регионалните планове за действие и програмите за обучение на медицинските екипи, работещи в условията на бедствия, аварии и катастрофи.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлава четвърта, раздел I от закона се занимава със здравната закрила на децата. Държавата, общините, юридическите и физическите лица създават условия за осигуряване на здравословна среда и нормално физическо и психическо развитие на децата. За подпомагане на семействата при отглеждането на деца до тригодишна възраст се създават детски ясли и детски кухни. Детските ясли са структури, в които медицински и други специалисти отглеждат, възпитават и обучават деца от тримесечна до тригодишна възраст, а детските кухни осигуряват храна за деца до тригодишна възраст. Изискванията към устройството и дейността на тези институции се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\nДетските ясли и кухни могат да се създават от общините, физически и юридически лица. Общинските детски ясли и кухни се създават, преобразуват и закриват със заповед на кмета на общината след решение на общинския съвет и съгласие на регионалната здравна инспекция. Издръжката на децата в общинските детски ясли и дейността на общинските детски кухни се финансират от общинския бюджет. Родителите заплащат такси за храна от детските кухни, определени от общинския съвет. Държавата предоставя средства на родителите за компенсиране на разходите за отглеждане на деца, които не са приети в общински детски ясли поради липса на места.\nЗдравните кабинети в детските градини и училищата осъществяват дейности по медицинско обслужване, подпомагане на деца с хронични заболявания, промоция на здравето, предотвратяване на заразни болести, организиране на здравно образование и участие в отдих и спорт. Тези дейности се извършват от лекари и медицински специалисти, които работят по договор с общината или собственика на частното учебно заведение. Финансирането на здравните кабинети в общинските и държавните училища и детски градини се извършва от общинските бюджети, докато в частните институции се финансира от собственика им.\nПри новооткрито заболяване или отклонение в развитието на детето здравните кабинети са задължени да уведомяват родителите и общопрактикуващия лекар. В рамките на учебните планове се осигурява обучение на учениците по лична хигиена, здравословно хранене, здравословен начин на живот, предпазване от инфекциозни болести, здравни рискове при употреба на тютюн, алкохол и наркотици, сексуално поведение и първа помощ.\nЗа осигуряване на профилактична медицинска и дентална помощ на децата и учениците веднъж годишно се извършват профилактични прегледи, които се финансират от Националната здравноосигурителна каса. Денталното лечение на деца от институции, управлявани от Министерството на образованието, Министерството на вътрешните работи и Министерството на правосъдието, се заплаща от съответните ведомства. За осигуряване на допълнително или специализирано медицинско обслужване на децата, заведенията могат да сключват договори с лечебни заведения за извънболнична помощ.\nМедицинските специалисти са длъжни да уведомят дирекция “Социално подпомагане” за всяко дете, родено в лечебно заведение, за което има риск от изоставяне, както и за деца, които са жертви на насилие.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона се занимава с репродуктивното здраве. Държавата осигурява здравна защита на репродуктивното здраве на гражданите чрез промоция и консултации за опазване на репродуктивното здраве, осигуряване на достъп до специализирана консултативна помощ, профилактика и лечение на безплодие, както и на предаваните по полов път болести и СПИН. Всеки гражданин има право на информация и свобода на решение относно своето репродуктивно здраве.\nЗа осигуряване на безрисково майчинство всяка жена има право на достъп до здравни дейности, насочени към осигуряване на оптимално здравословно състояние на жената и плода от началото на бременността до 42 дни след раждането. Тези здравни дейности включват промоция на здравето, профилактика на аборти и преждевременни раждания, обучение по хранене и грижи за новороденото, активно медицинско наблюдение на бременността, пренатална диагностика, осигуряване на оптимална жизнена среда за родилките и новородените, диспансерно наблюдение и свободен достъп до специализирана медицинска помощ. Бременните имат право да избират лечебно заведение за раждане.\nУсловията и редът за извършване на изкуствен аборт, както и критериите за жизнеспособност на плода, се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Същата наредба урежда и задълженията на медицинските специалисти при съмнение за аборт, извършен извън условията и реда на закона. Трайното отнемане на способността за репродукция също се извършва при условия и по ред, определени с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\n\n\n\nРаздел III от закона регулира асистираната репродукция, която се прилага, когато състоянието на мъжа или жената не позволява осъществяване на репродуктивните им функции по естествен път. Асистираната репродукция се извършва след получаване на писмено информирано съгласие от лицата, желаещи да създадат потомство, и след провеждане на медицински изследвания, гарантиращи здравето на потомството. Тя включва дейности като използване на медицински методи за оплождане на яйцеклетки, вземане, обработка и съхраняване на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи, както и поставяне на яйцеклетки в тялото на жената.\nЗа вземане на яйцеклетки от донор се изисква пълнолетие, писмено съгласие, информираност за рисковете и установено физическо и психическо здраве на донора. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да изготвят годишен отчет за извършените дейности и да го представят в Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”. Забранява се предлагането или приемането на материална облага за донорство на яйцеклетки или сперматозоиди.\nАсистираната репродукция се извършва от лечебни заведения, получили разрешение за тази дейност, и се контролира от Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”. Министърът на здравеопазването може да спре дейността на лечебно заведение, ако то не спазва изискванията на медицинския стандарт за асистирана репродукция. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да създадат и поддържат регистър за всички извършени дейности, свързани с асистираната репродукция, като данните се съхраняват 30 години.\nИзпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор” регистрира и анализира информацията за донорите, реципиентите и сериозните нежелани реакции или инциденти, свързани с асистираната репродукция. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да съобщят на агенцията за всички сериозни нежелани реакции или инциденти в 7-дневен срок и да създадат система за блокиране, изтегляне или унищожаване на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди или зиготи, които могат да доведат до рискове.\nЗабранява се изкуствено оплождане на яйцеклетка със сперматозоиди от донор, който е в кръвно родство с жената до четвърта степен. Износът и вносът на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи се извършва при условията на Закона за трансплантация на органи, тъкани и клетки. Неизползвани яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи могат да бъдат предоставяни за научни, учебни и лечебни цели след получаване на писмено съгласие от донорите.\nЗабранява се използването на техники за асистирана репродукция с цел подбор на пола на потомството, освен за предотвратяване на наследствени заболявания, свързани с пола. Също така се забранява репродуктивното клониране на хора и всяка форма на дискриминация, основана на генома на лицето.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV от закона се занимава с генетичното здраве и генетичните изследвания. Опазването на генетичното здраве се осъществява чрез профилактични и диагностични изследвания за доказване и класифициране на генетични заболявания, диспансеризация на лица с повишен риск, лечение на наследствени заболявания, установяване на наследствени признаци и идентифициране на родител, както и съхраняване на генетична информация. Профилактичните генетични изследвания се извършват за определяне на риска за генетични заболявания в потомството, идентифициране на клинично здрави носители на генетични отклонения и диагностика на наследствени заболявания преди, по време и след бременността.\nГенетичните изследвания в периода преди раждането се извършват при доказан риск за предаване на генетично заболяване и включват доказване на генетични отклонения, установяване на предразположения и анализ на генетични заболявания. За установяване на вида и честотата на генетичните отклонения и определяне на генетичния фонд се провеждат целеви проучвания. Генетичните изследвания и вземането на биологичен материал за медицински или научни цели се извършват само след писмено информирано съгласие от изследваните лица. При деца, лица с психични разстройства и лица под запрещение се изисква и разрешение от комисията по медицинска етика.\nРезултатите от генетичните изследвания не могат да бъдат основание за дискриминация, а данните за човешкия геном са лични и не могат да се предоставят на работодатели, здравноосигурителни организации или застрахователни компании. Генетичните изследвания се извършват от акредитирани генетични лаборатории към лечебни заведения или самостоятелни лаборатории. Министърът на здравеопазването определя Национална генетична лаборатория, която осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху генетичните лаборатории и създава национален генетичен регистър.\nЛечебните заведения информират Националната генетична лаборатория за проведените изследвания и резултатите от тях и създават служебен регистър на извършените изследвания. Генетичните лаборатории могат да създават ДНК банки за съхраняване на генетичен материал за научни и медицински цели, като ги регистрират в Министерството на здравеопазването. За установяване на вида и честотата на редките заболявания се създава национален регистър на пациентите с редки заболявания, като условията и редът за регистриране се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Същата наредба урежда и условията за участие на лечебни заведения в Европейските референтни мрежи и създаването на експертни центрове за редки болести.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлава пета, раздел I от закона се занимава със закрилата на психичното здраве. Държавата, общините и неправителствените организации организират дейности за опазване на психичното здраве, включително осигуряване на достъпна и качествена медицинска помощ за лица с психични разстройства, защита на психичното здраве при рискови групи, активна профилактика, подкрепа на обществените начинания и научноприложни изследвания. Общините осигуряват условия за психосоциална рехабилитация и подкрепа с финансови и материални средства, включително предоставяне на жилища за лица с психични разстройства.\nЛицата с психични разстройства, нуждаещи се от специални здравни грижи, включват тези с тежки психични нарушения, умствена изостаналост, деменция и други нарушения, които изискват медицинска помощ и подкрепа за пълноценен живот в семейството и социалната среда. Всяко лице с психично разстройство има право на лечение и грижи при равни условия с другите пациенти. Оценката за наличие на психично разстройство не може да се основава на семейни, професионални или други конфликти, нито на минали психични разстройства.\nМинистерството на здравеопазването създава и поддържа Национален служебен регистър на лица с психични разстройства, като редът и условията за ползване на данни от регистъра се определят с наредба. Основните принципи при лечението на лица с психични разстройства включват минимално ограничаване на личната свобода, намаляване на институционалната зависимост, изграждане на мрежа от специализирани заведения за извънболнична помощ и спазване на хуманитарните принципи.\nЛечението на лица с психични разстройства се извършва в лечебни заведения за първична или специализирана извънболнична помощ, стационарни психиатрични заведения, центрове за психично здраве и домове за медико-социални грижи. Забранява се използването на хирургични методи за промяна на централната нервна система с цел постигане на определени психични характеристики. При пациенти с психични разстройства, които представляват пряка опасност за себе си или другите, могат да се прилагат мерки за временно физическо ограничаване, но те не заместват активното лечение.\nТрудовата терапия е част от психосоциалните рехабилитационни програми, като е недопустима всякаква форма на експлоатация или принудителен труд. В социалните и интегрираните здравно-социални услуги за резидентна грижа се създават здравни кабинети, които осъществяват медицинско наблюдение, първа помощ и контрол върху хигиенните условия. Спешната психиатрична помощ се оказва от центрове за психично здраве, стационарни психиатрични заведения и центрове за спешна медицинска помощ.\nКогато състоянието на лице с психично разстройство налага продължаване на лечението след овладяване на спешното състояние, ръководителят на лечебното заведение може да настани лицето временно за лечение за срок до 24 часа, като уведомява близките. При необходимост от задължително лечение се внася мотивирано искане в съда, придружено от становище на психиатър.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона регулира задължителното настаняване и лечение на лица с психични разстройства, които поради заболяването си могат да извършат престъпления, представляващи опасност за себе си, близките или обществото. Задължителното настаняване и лечение се постановява с решение на районния съд по настоящия адрес на лицето или по местонахождението на лечебното заведение. Лечението се осъществява в лечебни заведения за стационарна психиатрична помощ, центрове за психично здраве, психиатрични отделения или клиники към многопрофилни болници.\nИскането за задължително настаняване и лечение може да бъде подадено от прокурора или от ръководителя на лечебното заведение. Съдът изпраща преписи от искането на лицето, което може да направи възражения и да представи доказателства в 7-дневен срок. Делото се разглежда в открито заседание с участието на лицето, психиатър, защитник и прокурор. Ако здравословното състояние на лицето не позволява присъствие в заседанието, съдът може да придобие непосредствено впечатление за състоянието му или да позволи участие чрез видеоконференция.\nСъдът назначава съдебно-психиатрична експертиза, за да установи наличието на психично разстройство и да определи необходимостта от задължително лечение. Експертизата се провежда в срок до 14 дни, като съдът може да удължи срока с до 10 дни при необходимост.\nСлед изслушване на заключението на експертизата, съдът се произнася с решение за задължително настаняване и лечение, определя лечебното заведение, срока и формата на лечението (амбулаторно или стационарно). Ако лицето не е способно да изрази информирано съгласие, съдът назначава близък или представител на общинската служба по здравеопазване, който да изрази съгласие за лечението.\nРешението на съда може да бъде обжалвано в 7-дневен срок, като обжалването спира изпълнението на решението, освен ако съдът постанови друго. Задължителното лечение се прекратява с изтичане на срока или с решение на съда при отпадане на предпоставките за лечение. На всеки три месеца съдът служебно преразглежда необходимостта от задължително настаняване и лечение въз основа на нова съдебно-психиатрична експертиза.\nВлязлото в сила решение за задължително настаняване и лечение се изпълнява от лечебните заведения, като при необходимост се осигурява съдействието на органите на Министерството на вътрешните работи.\n\n\n\n\nГлава шеста от закона регулира неконвенционалните методи за благоприятно въздействие върху индивидуалното здраве. Министърът на здравеопазването контролира прилагането на тези методи, които включват използването на нелекарствени продукти от органичен и минерален произход, нетрадиционни физикални методи, хомеопатия, акупунктура, акупресура, ирисови, пулсови и аурикуларни методи на изследване, както и диетика и лечебно гладуване. Забранено е използването на неконвенционални методи извън посочените. Министърът определя с наредба изискванията към лицата, които практикуват тези методи.\nПраво да практикуват неконвенционални методи имат български граждани и граждани на държави от Европейския съюз, Европейското икономическо пространство и Швейцария, които отговарят на определени образователни и здравни изисквания. Правото да практикуват хомеопатия е ограничено до лица с висше образование по медицина или дентална медицина. Лицата, които практикуват неконвенционални методи, са длъжни да упражняват дейността си добросъвестно, да не допускат увреждане на здравето, да разясняват подробно методите и да получават писмено съгласие от пациентите. Забранена е всякаква реклама на неконвенционални методи.\nЛицата, които практикуват неконвенционални методи, трябва да се регистрират в регионалната здравна инспекция, като предоставят необходимите документи. Регистрацията може да бъде отхвърлена при непълнота на документите или при нарушение на нормативните изисквания. Регионалната здравна инспекция поддържа публичен регистър на практикуващите неконвенционални методи, който включва данни за лицата и методите, които прилагат. Регистрираните лица са длъжни да уведомяват за промени в регистрацията си.\nРегистрацията може да бъде заличена по искане на лицето, при смърт, при представяне на неверни данни, при нарушение на регистрацията или при установени неблагоприятни последици за здравето. Заличаването се извършва със заповед на директора на регионалната здравна инспекция и подлежи на обжалване. Лицата, които практикуват неконвенционални методи, са длъжни да водят книга за посещения, в която се вписват данни за пациентите и извършените дейности. Книгата трябва да се съхранява 10 години и да се предоставя при поискване от контролните органи.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлава седма от закона регулира медицинското образование, медицинската професия, медицинските научни изследвания върху хора и медицинската наука. Раздел I се занимава с медицинското образование, което осигурява и гарантира качеството на подготовката на медицинските специалисти и на немедицинските специалисти, работещи в националната система за здравеопазване. Основните принципи на медицинското образование включват продължителност и високо качество на преподаването, етапност и непрекъсваемост на обучението, както и правото на избор на специалност.\nПодготовката за придобиване на образователно-квалификационната степен “магистър” по специалности от професионални направления като “Медицина”, “Дентална медицина”, “Фармация” и “Обществено здраве” се организира във факултети на висши училища с акредитация. Подготовката за степен “бакалавър” по специалности като “медицинска сестра”, “акушерка” и “лекарски асистент” се провежда във факултети или филиали на висши училища, а за други специалности от направлението “Здравни грижи” – в колежи. Подготовката за научна степен “доктор” се осъществява във висши училища, Българската академия на науките и други научни организации.\nПри връчване на дипломите лекарите и лекарите по дентална медицина полагат Хипократова клетва, чийто текст се приема от Висшия медицински съвет. За гражданите на държави от Европейския съюз, Европейското икономическо пространство и Швейцария се осигурява подходяща клетва. Министерският съвет приема единни държавни изисквания за придобиване на висше образование по специалностите в здравеопазването.\nСледдипломното обучение включва обучение за придобиване на специалност и продължаващо медицинско обучение. Министърът на здравеопазването планира, координира и контролира дейностите по следдипломно обучение, като ежегодно определя броя на субсидираните места в съответствие с националната здравна стратегия. Теоретичното обучение се провежда във висши училища и национални центрове, а практическото – в лечебни заведения. Специалност се придобива след успешно полагане на изпит пред държавна изпитна комисия.\nНоменклатурата на специалностите, условията и редът за обучение и придобиване на специалност се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването, съгласувана с министъра на образованието и науката и министъра на финансите. Финансирането на обучението се определя в съответствие с националната здравна стратегия.\nСъсловните организации на медицинските специалисти организират и контролират продължаващото медицинско обучение, като сътрудничат с висши училища, Българския Червен кръст и други организации. Висшите училища, Военномедицинската академия и други институции също провеждат продължаващо обучение на специалисти в здравеопазването. Съюзът на научните медицински дружества и други асоциации могат да участват в провеждането на продължаващото обучение.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона регулира медицинската професия. Медицинската професия се упражнява от лица, притежаващи диплома за завършено висше образование по специалности от професионални направления като “Медицина”, “Дентална медицина”, “Фармация” и “Здравни грижи”. Дипломата удостоверява придобитото висше образование, образователно-квалификационната степен и професионалната квалификация, определени в държавните изисквания. Лекарите, лекарите по дентална медицина, медицинските сестри, акушерките, асоциираните медицински специалисти, лекарските асистенти, зъботехниците и помощник-фармацевтите упражняват медицинската професия при определени условия, регламентирани от съответните закони за съсловните организации.\nМинистерството на здравеопазването поддържа списък на лицата, завършили висше образование по медицински специалности, като данните от списъка са достъпни за обществеността. Съсловните организации предоставят на министерството информация за вписване и заличаване на лица от регистрите, както и за наложените административни наказания. Висшите училища и институциите по професионалното образование също предоставят информация за завършилите студенти и придобилите професионална квалификация.\nГражданите на държави от Европейския съюз, Европейското икономическо пространство и Швейцария могат да упражняват медицинска професия в България след признаване на професионалната им квалификация. Чужденците извън тези държави могат да упражняват медицинска професия при условие, че владеят български език и професионалната терминология, и след успешно полагане на изпит, ако квалификацията им е придобита в трета държава. Министерството на здравеопазването и висшите училища осигуряват условия за придобиване на необходимите езикови познания.\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни да застраховат лицата, които упражняват медицинска професия, за вреди, които могат да настъпят вследствие на виновно неизпълнение на професионалните им задължения. Условията и редът за това застраховане се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\nМедицинските специалисти имат право на свобода на действия и решения съобразно професионалната им квалификация, медицинските стандарти и етиката. Те не могат да използват търговска реклама за своята дейност. Медицинските специалисти, които страдат от заболявания, застрашаващи здравето на пациентите, не могат да упражняват професията си. Министърът на здравеопазването може да отнеме правото на упражняване на медицинска професия за срок от шест месеца до две години при повторно нарушаване на медицинските стандарти или реда за извършване на експертизи. Заповедите на министъра подлежат на обжалване пред административен съд.\n\n\n\nОтменен в дъравен вестник\n\n\n\nРаздел IV от закона регулира медицинските научни изследвания върху хора и медицинската наука. Министерството на здравеопазването организира и контролира провеждането на такива изследвания, като те трябва да отговарят на строги етични и правни стандарти. Медицинското научно изследване се определя като всеки опит върху хора, целящ повишаване на медицинското познание, като изследваното лице има всички права на пациент. Безопасността на здравето на участниците и запазването на тайната на личните им данни са задължителни. Интересите на изследваното лице винаги са с приоритет пред научните и финансовите интереси на изследователите.\nМедицинските научни изследвания върху хора са забранени в случаи, когато противоречат на закона или медицинската етика, когато няма доказателства за безопасност или очаквани научни ползи, или когато съществува повишен риск за здравето и живота на участниците. Забранени са също изследвания с химически субстанции, физични източници на лъчение или продукти на генното инженерство, които могат да доведат до изменения в човешкия геном или предаване на нови признаци в потомството.\nУчастието в медицински научни изследвания изисква писмено информирано съгласие от дееспособно лице, което разбира същността, значението и рисковете от изследването. Съгласието може да бъде оттеглено по всяко време. Изследванията не се провеждат върху недееспособни лица, бременни, кърмачки или лица, лишени от свобода, освен ако не се очакват значителни ползи за здравето.\nРъководителят на медицинското научно изследване носи солидарна отговорност за вредите, причинени на участниците, и е длъжен да сключи застраховка, покриваща тази отговорност. Условията и редът за застраховането се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет. Ръководителят на изследването трябва да бъде лекар или лекар по дентална медицина с призната специалност, а изследванията се провеждат от квалифицирани специалисти с висше образование в областта на медицината, денталната медицина, фармацията, биологията или биохимията.\nМедицинските научни изследвания се провеждат след положително становище от местна комисия по етика, учредена в лечебното или научното заведение. Комисията упражнява контрол върху провеждането на изследванията и може да предложи прекратяването им при установени пропуски или нарушения. Ръководителят на изследването е длъжен да информира комисията при завършване или преустановяване на изследването.\nМедицинското научно изследване може да бъде преустановено при оттегляне на съгласието на участника, при установяване на вредно въздействие върху здравето му или по предложение на ръководителя на изследването или на председателя на местната комисия по етика. Прекратяването на изследването се извършва със заповед на директора на регионалната здравна инспекция.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването определя условията и реда за провеждане на медицинските научни изследвания и ежегодно обявява конкурси за научни проекти по държавните научни приоритети в областта на медицината. Научните проекти се финансират чрез държавни субсидии и други източници.\nТялото на починало лице може да се използва за обучение и научни изследвания във висшите медицински училища при изразено писмено съгласие от лицето приживе или от близките му след смъртта му. Висшите медицински училища поемат разходите по погребението на починалото лице в определени случаи. Редът за използване на телата на починалите за обучение и изследвания се определя с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Глава първа на закона, озаглавена “Национална система за здравеопазване”, разглежда общите положения, свързани с опазването на здравето на гражданите. Законът урежда обществените отношения в тази област и определя здравето като национален приоритет, който се гарантира от държавата. Здравето се разбира като състояние на пълно физическо, психическо и социално благополучие, а не само като отсъствие на болести. За постигането на тази цел се прилагат редица принципи, сред които равнопоставеност при ползване на здравни услуги, осигуряване на достъпна и качествена здравна помощ с приоритет за уязвими групи като деца, бременни и майки на деца до една година, както и насоченост към промоция на здраве и профилактика на болестите.\nОсвен това, законът поставя акцент върху предотвратяването и намаляването на рисковете за здравето, свързани с неблагоприятното въздействие на факторите на жизнената среда. Особено внимание се отделя на здравната закрила на деца, бременни, майки на деца до една година, както и на лица с физически увреждания и психически разстройства. Държавата участва активно във финансирането на дейности, насочени към опазване на здравето, като това се осъществява чрез държавния бюджет и други финансови източници.\nДържавната здравна политика се ръководи и осъществява от Министерския съвет, който по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването одобрява Национална здравна стратегия. Тази стратегия се приема от Народното събрание и служи като основа за разработването на национални здравни програми и планове. Тези документи се основават на оценка на здравното състояние и здравните потребности на гражданите, както и на здравно-демографските тенденции и ресурсните възможности на националната система за здравеопазване. Националните здравни програми и планове се финансират предимно от държавния бюджет, като могат да бъдат подпомагани и от други източници.\nНационалната система за здравеопазване включва лечебни и здравни заведения, регулирани от съответните закони, както и държавни, общински и обществени органи и институции, които отговарят за организацията, управлението и контрола на дейностите, свързани с опазването и укрепването на здравето. Този раздел на закона подчертава важността на комплексния подход към здравето, като съчетава лечебни, профилактични и управленски аспекти, за да се гарантира ефективна и достъпна здравна система за всички граждани.\n\n\n\nРаздел II на закона, озаглавен “Органи на управление на националната система за здравеопазване”, определя структурата и функциите на основните институции, отговорни за управлението и контрола на здравната система в страната. Централната фигура в тази система е министърът на здравеопазването, който ръководи националната система за здравеопазване и осъществява контрол върху ключови области като опазването на здравето на гражданите, държавния здравен контрол, спешната медицинска помощ, трансфузионната хематология, стационарната психиатрична помощ, медико-социалните грижи за деца до тригодишна възраст, трансплантацията и здравната информация. Министърът също така отговаря за осигуряването и устойчивото развитие на здравните дейности в лечебните и здравните заведения, както и за медицинската експертиза.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването има задължението да представя годишен доклад в Народното събрание за състоянието на здравето на гражданите и изпълнението на Националната здравна стратегия. Този доклад се предоставя в срок до три месеца преди началото на бюджетната година. Освен това, министърът утвърждава разпределението на субсидиите от държавния бюджет за дейности, свързани със здравеопазването, с изключение на някои специфични области, като държавен здравен контрол и спешна медицинска помощ. Министърът също така осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху медицинската дейност на лечебните заведения, създадени към различни министерства, като Министерството на отбраната, Министерството на вътрешните работи, Министерството на правосъдието и Министерството на транспорта, информационните технологии и съобщенията.\nКъм министъра на здравеопазването е създаден Висш медицински съвет, който е консултативен орган, включващ представители на различни професионални организации и институции в областта на здравеопазването. Този съвет обсъжда и дава становища по ключови въпроси, свързани с приоритетите на Националната здравна стратегия, етичните проблеми на медицината и биомедицината, законопроекти и нормативни актове, годишния проектобюджет на здравеопазването, научните приоритети в медицината, годишния прием на студенти и специализанти, както и видовете специалности в областта на здравеопазването. Организацията и дейността на Висшия медицински съвет се уреждат с правилник, утвърден от министъра на здравеопазването.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването също така определя експертни съвети по медицински специалности или отделни медицински дейности, както и републикански консултанти по медицински специалности. Тези експертни съвети и консултанти предоставят консултации и становища по въпроси, свързани с медицинската практика и здравната система. Финансирането на техните дейности се осъществява в рамките на бюджета на Министерството на здравеопазването или от съответните лечебни заведения.\nНа регионално ниво, държавната здравна политика се осъществява и организира от регионални здравни инспекции, които са юридически лица на бюджетна издръжка към министъра на здравеопазването. Тези инспекции отговарят за държавен здравен контрол, контрол върху регистрацията и здравната дейност на лечебните и здравните заведения, планиране и организиране на медицинската експертиза, промоция на здравето и профилактика на болестите, събиране и анализ на здравна информация, както и координация на национални и международни здравни програми и проекти. Регионалните здравни инспекции също така проучват потребностите от медицински и немедицински специалисти и предлагат на министъра на здравеопазването броя на местата за следдипломно обучение по специалности.\nФинансирането на регионалните здравни инспекции се осъществява чрез субсидии от държавния бюджет и приходи от собствена дейност, включително държавни такси, глоби и имуществени санкции. Тези средства се използват за осъществяване на контролна дейност, профилактика на болестите, лабораторни анализи и изпитвания, както и за участие в национални и международни междулабораторни изпитвания.\nТази структура на управление на националната система за здравеопазване осигурява комплексен подход към опазването и укрепването на здравето на гражданите, като съчетава централното ръководство с регионална и местна инициатива и контрол.\n\n\n\nРаздел III на закона, озаглавен “Държавен здравен контрол”, определя механизмите и процедурите за защита на здравето на гражданите чрез систематичен и насочен контрол върху обекти, продукти, стоки и дейности, които имат значение за общественото здраве. Основната цел на държавния здравен контрол е да се гарантира спазването на установените здравни изисквания и норми, както и да се предотвратят рискове за здравето на населението.\nОрганите на държавния здравен контрол включват главния държавен здравен инспектор на Република България, регионалните здравни инспекции и Националния център по радиобиология и радиационна защита (НЦРРЗ). Главният държавен здравен инспектор се назначава от министър-председателя по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването и отговаря за организирането и ръководството на държавния здравен контрол. Той също така осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху звената по ведомствен здравен контрол към различни министерства, като Министерството на правосъдието, Министерството на транспорта, информационните технологии и съобщенията, Министерството на отбраната и Министерството на вътрешните работи.\nДържавният здравен контрол се извършва от държавни здравни инспектори, които са държавни служители в Министерството на здравеопазването, регионалните здравни инспекции и НЦРРЗ. Тези инспектори имат правото да осъществяват контрол без предварително уведомяване и да извършват проверки при постъпване на сигнали от граждани, държавни и общински органи, както и при наличие на данни за възникнали инциденти, които могат да застрашат здравето на населението.\nДържавните здравни инспектори имат широки правомощия, включително правото на свободен достъп до обекти, продукти и дейности, подлежащи на контрол, да изискват сведения и документи, да вземат проби за лабораторни анализи, да предписват отстраняване от работа на лица, които представляват опасност за здравето на околните, и да налагат задължителни хигиенни и противоепидемични мерки. Те също така могат да спират експлоатацията на обекти с обществено предназначение или реализацията на продукти и стоки, които не отговарят на здравните изисквания, както и да съставят актове за установяване на административни нарушения.\nРегионалните здравни инспекции осъществяват държавен здравен контрол чрез дейности, насочени към контрол на спазването на здравните изисквания за обекти с обществено предназначение, продукти и стоки със значение за здравето, дейности, които могат да засегнат здравето на гражданите, и фактори на жизнената среда. Те също така отговарят за надзора на заразните болести и контрола на спазването на забрани и ограничения за реклама и продажба на алкохолни напитки и тютюнопушене.\nАнализът на проби от продукти и стоки, както и на факторите на жизнената среда, се извършва в акредитирани лаборатории, определени със заповед на министъра на здравеопазването. Тези лаборатории трябва да отговарят на изискванията на международните стандарти за качество и компетентност. В случай, че лабораториите не са акредитирани, министърът може да определи временно лаборатории за анализ, при условие че те са започнали процедури за акредитация и прилагат система за гарантиране на качеството на лабораторната дейност.\nДоброволното плащане на глоби и имуществени санкции, наложени от органите на държавния здравен контрол, може да се извършва в Министерството на здравеопазването или в съответната регионална здравна инспекция. Този механизъм осигурява ефективност и прозрачност при налагането на санкции за нарушения на здравните изисквания.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV на закона, озаглавен “Здравни заведения”, определя структурата, функциите и дейността на здравните заведения, които са част от националната система за здравеопазване. Тези заведения имат за цел да опазват и укрепят здравето на гражданите чрез предоставяне на медицински и немедицински услуги. Здравните заведения включват национални центрове по проблемите на общественото здраве, Националната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК), здравните кабинети и оптиките.\nНационалните центрове по проблемите на общественото здраве са юридически лица на бюджетна издръжка, които се откриват, преобразуват и закриват с постановление на Министерския съвет по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването. Тези центрове се ръководят от директори, които се назначават след конкурс и се атестират на всеки три години. Директорите могат да бъдат освободени от длъжност в случай на отрицателна атестация. Националните центрове осъществяват широк спектър от дейности, включително проучвания, оценки, експертизи, анализи и прогнози в областта на общественото здраве, предотвратяване и ликвидиране на епидемии, организиране на медицинска помощ при бедствия, оценка на рисковете от факторите на жизнената среда, лабораторни изследвания, промоция на здраве и интегрирана профилактика на болестите, както и експертна и методическа помощ на други здравни и лечебни заведения.\nНационалната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК) е друго важно здравно заведение, което също е юридическо лице на бюджетна издръжка. НЕЛК се ръководи от директор, който се назначава след конкурс и се атестира на всеки три години. Основната дейност на НЕЛК е да осъществява експертни, контролно-методически и консултативни дейности, свързани с експертизата на работоспособността.\nЗдравните кабинети са структури, които се създават в детски градини, училища и социални услуги за резидентна грижа. Тези кабинети предоставят здравни услуги за деца и ученици, като изискванията за тяхното устройство и дейност се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Финансирането на здравните кабинети се осъществява от държавата и общините, като ежегодно се определят средствата за оборудване, консумативи и изпълнение на дейностите.\nОптиките са здравни заведения, които осъществяват дейности, свързани с здравната консултация по проблемите на зрението, корекция на зрението, изработка и продажба на очила и материали за очна оптика. Оптиките се ръководят от лица с висше образование в областта на медицината или с професионална квалификация като техник по очна оптика или оптик-оптометрист. Здравните консултации в оптиките могат да се осъществяват само при наличие на договор с лекар, специализиран в очни болести.\nОткриването на оптики се извършва по определен ред, а изискванията за тяхното устройство и дейност се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Този раздел на закона гарантира, че здравните заведения функционират ефективно и в съответствие с установените стандарти, като същевременно предоставят необходимите здравни услуги на гражданите.\n\n\n\nРаздел V на закона, озаглавен “Здравна информация и документация”, регулира събирането, обработката, използването и съхраняването на здравна информация, която включва лични данни, свързани със здравословното състояние, физическото и психическото развитие на лицата, както и друга информация, съдържаща се в медицински рецепти, предписания, протоколи, удостоверения и друга медицинска документация. Този раздел гарантира защита на личните данни на пациентите, като същевременно осигурява необходимите механизми за обмен на информация между здравните институции и специалисти.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения, регионалните здравни инспекции, лекарите, лекарите по дентална медицина, фармацевтите и други медицински специалисти, както и немедицинските специалисти с висше образование, работещи в националната система за здравеопазване, са задължени да събират, обработват, използват и съхраняват здравна информация. Формите и съдържанието на медицинската документация, както и условията и редът за нейната обработка, използване и съхранение, се определят с наредби на министъра на здравеопазването, съгласувани с Националния статистически институт.\nЗдравната информация може да бъде предоставяна на трети лица в определени случаи, като например при продължаване на лечението в друго лечебно заведение, при заплаха за здравето или живота на други лица, при идентификация на човешки труп или за установяване на причините за смъртта, за нуждите на държавния здравен контрол, медицинската експертиза, общественото осигуряване, медицинската статистика или медицински научни изследвания. В случаите, когато здравната информация се предоставя за нуждите на застраховател, това се извършва само при наличие на лиценз по определените в закона категории.\nЛицата, които събират и обработват здравна информация, са длъжни да осигурят нейната защита от неправомерен достъп. Пациентите имат право да получат здравната информация, отнасяща се до тяхното здравословно състояние, включително копия от медицинските им документи. Те могат да упълномощят писмено друго лице да се запознае с медицинските им документи и да направи копия от тях. В случай на смърт на пациента, неговите наследници и роднини до четвърта степен включително имат право да се запознаят със здравната информация за починалия и да направят копия от медицинските му документи.\nМедицинските специалисти и служители в лечебните заведения нямат право да разгласяват информация за пациента, която е получена при изпълнение на служебните им задължения. Това гарантира поверителността на здравната информация и защитата на личните данни на пациентите.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването, разпоредителите с бюджети към него и лечебните заведения, които поддържат регистри с национално значение, имат право на безвъзмезден достъп до информационните регистри, изградени и поддържани с бюджетни средства. Това осигурява ефективност и прозрачност при управлението на здравната информация и нейното използване за нуждите на националната система за здравеопазване.\n\n\n\nРаздел VI на закона, озаглавен “Национална здравноинформационна система”, въвежда създаването и функционирането на Националната здравноинформационна система (НЗИС), която се администрира и поддържа от Министерството на здравеопазването. Тази система има за цел да събира, обработва и съхранява информация за здравното състояние на населението чрез създаване и поддържане на електронен здравен запис за всеки гражданин. НЗИС се основава на принципите за актуалност и точност на данните, осигуряване на подходяща среда за обмен на данни, регламентиран достъп до данните при спазване на закона, както и оперативна съвместимост и информационна сигурност.\nМедицинските и немедицинските специалисти в лечебните и здравните заведения са длъжни да създават електронен здравен запис за всяка извършена дейност, като изготвената здравна документация се изпраща към НЗИС като електронен документ, подписан с квалифициран електронен подпис. Електронният здравен запис представлява съвкупност от електронни документи за всяка една от извършените дейности, включително тези, извършени от разстояние, които са относими към здравословното състояние на гражданина, независимо от неговия здравноосигурителен статус и източника на финансиране на съответната дейност. Лечебните и здравните заведения нямат право да изискват заплащане от пациентите за извършване на дейностите по създаване на електронния здравен запис.\nНЗИС включва електронните здравни записи на гражданите, както и всички регистри, информационни бази от данни и системи, които се водят от Министерството на здравеопазването, неговите второстепенни разпоредители с бюджет, лечебни и здравни заведения, Националната здравноосигурителна каса и застрахователните дружества. За нуждите на системата, първичните администратори на данни предоставят автоматизирано на министъра на здравеопазването безвъзмездно данни за гражданската регистрация и валидността на българските лични документи, както и информация за здравноосигурителния статус на физическите лица.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения подават информация в Министерството на здравеопазването за създаване и поддържане на електронните здравни записи на гражданите. Видът на информацията, начинът на нейното предоставяне, както и условията и редът за предоставянето й се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Също така, с наредба се определят условията и редът за водене на регистрите, информационните бази от данни и системи, включени в НЗИС.\nПраво на безвъзмезден достъп до НЗИС имат гражданите – до информацията в техния електронен здравен запис, лечебните и здравните заведения, Националната здравноосигурителна каса, застрахователните дружества, държавни органи и съсловни организации на медицински специалисти. Предоставянето на достъп до информацията в електронния здравен запис на гражданина на трети лица се извършва само след изрично писмено съгласие при условия и по ред, определени в наредбата.\nЛечебните и здравните заведения не носят отговорност за неверни, неактуални или неправилно въведени от други лица данни в регистрите и информационните системи. При противоречие между документ на хартиен носител и електронен здравен запис, предимство има записът в НЗИС, освен ако няма обективни причини, които поставят под съмнение автентичността на електронния документ.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването извършва оценка на специализирания софтуер, чрез който се обменят данни със системата, относно лесното му използване и съответствието му с изискванията на наредбата. Производителите на специализирания софтуер го предоставят на лица, определени от министъра на здравеопазването, безплатно за целите на оценяването. Министърът утвърждава и публикува списък на оценените специализирани софтуери на интернет страницата на Министерството на здравеопазването.\nОсвен това, министърът на здравеопазването изгражда и поддържа система за управление на графиците на работа с пациенти на медицинските специалисти в лечебните заведения като част от НЗИС.

    "text": "Глава втора на закона, озаглавена “Дейности по опазване на здравето”, разглежда общите положения, свързани с планирането, разработването и провеждането на политики, насочени към опазване на здравето на гражданите. Този раздел установява рамката за дейности, които имат за цел да осигурят здравословна жизнена среда, да насърчават здравословен начин на живот и да провеждат здравна профилактика.\nДържавните и общинските органи и институции са отговорни за планирането и провеждането на политики, насочени към опазване на здравето. Тези политики включват осигуряване на здравословна жизнена среда, обучение за здравословен начин на живот и здравна профилактика. Общините могат да подпомагат дейността си в областта на здравната профилактика чрез здравни медиатори, които помагат при провеждането на политики сред населението и при предоставянето на медицинска помощ. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба изискванията за дейността на здравните медиатори. Освен това, дейността по здравна профилактика може да се подпомага и от юридически лица с нестопанска цел, които имат доказан опит в съответната област, при условия и по ред, определени с наредба.\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни системно да извършват профилактични прегледи и диспансеризация с цел опазване на здравето и работоспособността на гражданите. Лицата с повишен здравен риск или със заболявания подлежат на диспансеризация, която включва редовни прегледи и наблюдение за ранно откриване и предотвратяване на заболявания. Условията, редът и финансирането за извършване на профилактичните прегледи и диспансеризацията, както и списъкът на заболяванията, при които се извършва диспансеризация, се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\n\n\n\nРаздел II на закона, озаглавен “Осигуряване на здравословна жизнена среда”, установява мерките и механизмите за опазване на здравето на гражданите чрез осигуряване на безопасна и здравословна жизнена среда. Този раздел включва разпоредби, свързани с контрола на факторите на жизнената среда, здравните изисквания за обекти, продукти и дейности, както и процедурите за налагане на мерки при нарушения.\nДържавата, общините, юридическите и физическите лица са длъжни да осигуряват опазването на жизнената среда от вредни биологични, химични, физични и социални фактори, които могат да засегнат здравето на гражданите. Министърът на здравеопазването ръководи националната система за анализ, оценка и контрол на шума, замърсителите в питейните води и нейонизиращите лъчения в урбанизираните територии и обществените сгради. Той анализира и оценява факторите на жизнената среда на национално ниво и предлага мерки за ограничаване на вредното им въздействие върху здравето на гражданите. Регионалните здравни инспекции наблюдават, анализират и оценяват факторите на жизнената среда на територията на областта и предлагат мерки за ограничаване на вредното им въздействие.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването организира епидемиологични проучвания за установяване на зависимост между замърсяването на околната среда и здравното състояние на населението. Министерският съвет и общините приемат и финансират програми за провеждане на дейности, свързани с опазване, укрепване и възстановяване на здравето на гражданите в населени места, където е установена такава зависимост.\nЗдравните изисквания за обекти с обществено предназначение, продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека, както и максимално допустимите нива на факторите на жизнената среда, се определят с наредби на министъра на здравеопазването. Освен това, здравните изисквания към лицата, работещи в детските заведения, социалните и интегрираните здравно-социални услуги, водоснабдителните обекти, предприятията за производство и търговия с храни, бръснарските, фризьорските и козметичните салони, също се определят с наредба.\nОрганите на държавния здравен контрол участват в експертните съвети по устройство на територията, съгласуват устройствени планове и участват в оценката на инвестиционните проекти. Всеки, който открие обект с обществено предназначение, е длъжен да уведоми съответната регионална здравна инспекция за това, като посочва адреса на обекта, видовете дейности, които се извършват, и данни за лицето, което упражнява дейността. Регионалните здравни инспекции извършват проверка за спазване на здравните изисквания в обекта в срок до един месец от уведомяването.\nПри неспазване на здравните изисквания държавните здравни инспектори издават задължителни предписания и определят срок за отстраняване на нарушенията. В случай на неизпълнение на предписанията, директорът на регионалната здравна инспекция издава заповед за спиране на експлоатацията на обекта или на съответната дейност. При непосредствена опасност за живота и здравето на хората, държавните здравни инспектори могат да спират незабавно експлоатацията на обекта или дейността.\nЗа издаване на здравен сертификат за износ на продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека, заинтересованото лице подава заявление до главния държавен здравен инспектор, като прилага необходимите документи. Здравният сертификат се издава в срок до 15 работни дни от подаване на заявлението. В Министерството на здравеопазването се създава и поддържа регистър на издадените здравни сертификати за износ на продукти и стоки със значение за здравето на човека.\nПри съмнение за безопасността на продукти и стоки, държавният здравен инспектор издава предписание за спиране на реализацията им и взема проби за лабораторен анализ. При потвърждаване на безопасността на продуктите, държавният здравен инспектор отменя предписанието за спиране на реализацията. В случай че продуктите и стоките не съответстват на здравните изисквания, се издава заповед за преработка, използване за други цели или унищожаване на продуктите и стоките.\nУсловията и редът за вземане на проби и провеждане на лабораторни изследвания се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Физическите и юридическите лица са длъжни да изпълняват задължителните предписания на държавните здравни инспектори и заповедите на органите за държавен здравен контрол. Принудителните административни мерки, наложени по реда на този раздел, се обжалват по административен ред.\n\n\n\nРаздел III на закона, озаглавен “Здравни изисквания към козметичните продукти”, установява рамката за регулиране на козметичните продукти, които се предоставят на пазара, с цел гарантиране на тяхната безопасност за човешкото здраве. Този раздел се основава на разпоредбите на Регламент (ЕО) № 1223/2009 на Европейския парламент и на Съвета, който урежда изискванията за козметичните продукти в Европейския съюз.\nКозметичните продукти трябва да бъдат безопасни за човешкото здраве, когато се използват при нормални или разумно предвидими условия. Това включва спазване на добрата производствена практика, извършване на оценка на безопасността, съставяне на досие с информация за продукта, както и спазване на изискванията за етикетиране, нотификация и ограничения за веществата в състава на козметичните продукти. Информацията на етикета трябва да бъде предоставена на български език, включително данни за производителя, състава, срока на годност и инструкции за употреба.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването и органите на държавния здравен контрол са компетентни органи, отговорни за контрола на козметичните продукти. Те периодично преразглеждат и оценяват дейността си по отношение на контрола на козметични продукти, като резултатите от тази оценка се съобщават на другите държави – членки на Европейския съюз и на Европейската комисия, както и се оповестяват публично.\nКлиниката по токсикология на Университетската многопрофилна болница “Н. И. Пирогов” е определена като токсикологичен център, отговорен за обработването на информацията, предоставена от Европейската комисия, и за осигуряване на защита на поверителността на тази информация.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба подробни правила за представяне на информацията относно козметичните продукти, които не са предварително пакетирани или се пакетират в момента на продажбата им по искане на потребителя. Освен това, с наредба се определят изискванията за ефикасността на продуктите, предназначени за защита от слънчевото лъчение, както и химичните методи за проверка на състава на козметичните продукти.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV на закона, озаглавен “Дейности за въздействие върху рискови за здравето фактори”, установява мерки за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ), както и за предотвратяване на тяхната злоупотреба, особено сред младежите под 18 години. Този раздел включва както национални, така и регионални програми, насочени към промоция на здравословен начин на живот и осигуряване на достъп до медицинска помощ и социална защита за засегнатите лица.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването и други компетентни държавни органи съвместно с неправителствените организации създават условия за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ) сред младежите. Тези дейности се осъществяват чрез национални програми, които включват промотивни и профилактични инициативи, както и осигуряване на достъп до медицинска помощ и социална защита. Средствата за финансиране на тези програми се извличат от акцизите върху тютюневите изделия и спиртните напитки, като една стотна от тези постъпления се използва за тази цел.\nОбщините също са задължени да приемат и осъществяват регионални програми за ограничаване на употребата на тютюневи изделия, алкохол, наркотични вещества и диазотен оксид (райски газ) сред младежите. Тези програми имат за цел да намалят рисковете за здравето, свързани с тези вещества, и да насърчат здравословен начин на живот.\nЗаконът забранява продажбата на алкохолни напитки на лица под 18 години, в пияно състояние, на територията на детските градини, училищата, общежитията за ученици, лечебните заведения, както и по време на спортни прояви и обществени мероприятия, организирани за деца и ученици. Също така, забранява се продажбата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) на физически лица, с изключение на търговци, чиято дейност включва продажбата на този продукт, както и на територията на детските градини, училищата, общежитията за ученици, лечебните заведения, спортни прояви и обществени мероприятия, организирани за деца и ученици.\nПряката реклама на спиртни напитки е забранена, а непряката реклама на спиртни напитки и рекламата на вино и бира не може да бъде насочена към лица под 18 години, да използва лица под 18 години като участници, да свързва употребата на алкохол със спортни постижения или управление на превозни средства, или да съдържа неверни твърдения относно полза за здравето. Непряката реклама на спиртни напитки не може да се излъчва в радио- и телевизионни предавания преди 22:00 часа.\nЗабранява се и рекламата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) в онлайн платформи, като за преустановяване на такава реклама се разпорежда премахването ѝ със заповед от председателя на Комисията за защита на потребителите.\nТютюнопушенето е забранено в закритите обществени места, включително в помещенията с обособени работни места и спомагателни помещения. По изключение се допуска тютюнопушене в обособени самостоятелни помещения на летищата, които трябва да отговарят на строги изисквания за вентилация и изолация. Забранява се и тютюнопушенето на открити обществени места, като детски градини, училища, площадки за игра и спортни обекти по време на прояви. Също така, забранява се употребата на диазотен оксид (райски газ) на открити и закрити обществени места, с изключение на медицински цели и случаи, предвидени в Закона за храните.\n\n\n\nРаздел V, озаглавен “Надзор на заразните болести”, установява мерките и механизмите за предотвратяване и контрол на разпространението на заразни болести в страната. Този раздел включва разпоредби за граничен здравен контрол, задължителни имунизации, регистрация и отчет на заразни болести, както и мерки за справяне с извънредни епидемични ситуации.\nГраничният здравен контрол се извършва при необходимост за предотвратяване на разпространението на особено опасни заразни болести. Условията и редът за провеждане на този контрол се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\nЗа предпазване на гражданите от заразни болести се извършват задължителни имунизации. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба лицата, които подлежат на имунизации, както и реда, начина и сроковете за извършване на планови, целеви и препоръчителни имунизации. При възникване на извънредна епидемична обстановка или значителен спад в имунизационното покритие, министърът може да разпореди задължителни имунизации за определени групи от населението, включително с препарати, които не са включени в имунизационния календар.\nБолните от заразни болести, контактните с тях лица и заразоносителите подлежат на регистрация, задължително съобщаване и отчет. Министърът на здравеопазването определя с наредба болестите, които подлежат на регистрация, както и реда за надзор, ранно оповестяване и предприемане на мерки при случаи на биотероризъм или поява на нови, непознати заразни болести. Освен това, министърът определя реда за изследване, съобщаване и отчет на заразеност с вируса на синдрома на придобита имунна недостатъчност (СПИН) и реда за съобщаване, проучване и регистриране на хранителни заболявания.\nЛица, болни от и заразоносители на особено опасни заразни болести като антракс, бруцелоза, дифтерия, ебола, холера и чума, подлежат на задължителна изолация. Контактните с тях лица подлежат на задължителна карантина. Министърът на здравеопазването може да разпореди задължителна изолация и карантина за други заразни болести, въз основа на оценка на епидемичния риск. Задължителната изолация и карантина се извършват с предписание, издадено от регионалната здравна инспекция, и подлежат на предварително изпълнение.\nПри непосредствена опасност за живота и здравето на гражданите от епидемично разпространение на заразна болест, Министерският съвет може да обяви извънредна епидемична обстановка. В такива случаи, министърът на здравеопазването въвежда временни противоепидемични мерки, включително забрана за влизане на територията на страната, ограничаване на придвижването и спиране на работа на обекти с обществено предназначение. Тези мерки се координират от областните управители и се финансират от държавния бюджет.\nФизическите и юридическите лица, които извършват дейности по дезинфекция, дезинсекция и дератизация, са длъжни да уведомят Министерството на здравеопазването за започването на дейността си. Условията и редът за извършване на тези дейности се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването и министъра на земеделието и храните.\n\n\n\nРазделът, посветен на защитата на лицата от въздействието на йонизиращи лъчения, установява изчерпателна рамка за осигуряване на радиационна безопасност и предотвратяване на рискове за здравето на гражданите и работниците, изложени на такива лъчения. Основната цел е да се гарантира, че използването на източници на йонизиращи лъчения, както в медицински, така и в промишлени или други контексти, се извършва при строго спазване на установените принципи и изисквания за радиационна защита.\nЗащитата включва контрол на факторите на работната и жизнената среда, насочен към намаляване на облъчването на лицата. Това включва медицинско наблюдение на лицата, работещи с източници на йонизиращи лъчения, като се оценява тяхната медицинска пригодност за изпълнение на професионални задължения. Дозиметричният контрол е друг ключов елемент, който позволява да се определи вътрешното и външното облъчване на тези лица. Освен това, се извършва оценка на радиационния риск за населението като цяло или за определени групи, като се вземат предвид различни фактори, свързани с изложението на йонизиращи лъчения.\nМедицинското наблюдение на лицата, работещи с източници на йонизиращи лъчения, се осъществява от квалифицирани лекари, включително специалисти от Националния център по радиобиология и радиационна защита (НЦРРЗ). Тези лекари оценяват медицинската пригодност на работниците и осигуряват необходимата поддръжка в случай на радиационни аварии или други извънредни ситуации. В случай на спор относно медицинската пригодност, може да се подаде жалба пред специална комисия, която се произнася окончателно по въпроса.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването има правомощията да издава наредби, които уреждат различни аспекти на радиационната защита. Това включва условията и реда за медицинско осигуряване в случай на радиационна авария, здравните норми при работа в среда на йонизиращи лъчения, както и изискванията за защита на лицата при хронично облъчване. Освен това, се установяват правила за индивидуален дозиметричен контрол и за осигуряване на безопасност при медицинско облъчване.\nЗа извършване на дейности по изпитване на качеството на медицинската радиологична апаратура е необходимо юридическо лице или едноличен търговец да бъде вписан в специален регистър. Този регистър се поддържа от Министерството на здравеопазването и включва информация за лицата, които извършват тези дейности, както и за техните квалификации и опит. Вписването в регистъра е задължително и се извършва след подаване на заявление и предоставяне на необходимите документи. В случай на нередовности или предоставяне на неверни данни, министърът на здравеопазването може да откаже вписването.\nМедицинското облъчване с източници на йонизиращи лъчения е разрешено само при определени условия, като диагностика, лечение или здравен скрининг. В случай на деца или бременни жени, облъчването се извършва само при строги условия и само от специалисти с допълнително обучение. Пациентите имат право да откажат облъчване по всяко време, а медицинските специалисти са длъжни да предоставят пълна информация за рисковете и ползите от процедурата.\nПри радиационни аварии или други извънредни ситуации, органите на държавния здравен контрол могат да разрешат извършването на дейности от доброволци, дори при превишаване на установените граници на облъчване. В такива случаи, лицата подлежат на незабавно медицинско изследване и наблюдение.\nМинистерството на здравеопазването създава и поддържа регистър на лицата, работещи или работили в среда на йонизиращи лъчения. Този регистър служи за проследяване на здравното състояние на тези лица и за оценка на дългосрочните ефекти от излагането на радиация.\n\n\n\nРаздел VII се занимава с мерките за защита на здравето на гражданите при извършване на дейности, свързани с азбест и азбестосъдържащи материали. За да се извършат дейности по разрушаване или отстраняване на такива материали от сгради, конструкции, предприятия, инсталации или кораби, е необходимо да се получи разрешение от директора на регионалната здравна инспекция, на чиято територия се намира обектът. За получаване на разрешението, заинтересованото лице трябва да подаде заявление, план за работа, списък на ангажираните работници и служители, както и удостоверение за обучение на персонала. Планът за работа трябва да включва подробна информация за вида и продължителността на дейностите, мястото на извършване, използваните методи, личните предпазни средства, оборудването за защита на работниците и околната среда, както и мерките за доказване на липсата на риск след приключване на дейностите.\nОсвен това, планът трябва да предвижда отстраняването на азбеста преди прилагането на техники за разрушаване, освен ако това би довело до по-голям риск за работниците. Обучението на персонала се извършва съгласно условията, определени в наредбата по Закона за здравословни и безопасни условия на труд. Важно е да се отбележи, че разрешение не се изисква при извършване на аварийно-спасителни дейности.\nСлед подаване на заявлението, директорът на регионалната здравна инспекция изпраща документите за становище на регионалната инспекция по околната среда и водите в тридневен срок. Регионалната инспекция по околната среда и водите трябва да даде становище в 14-дневен срок, като при липса на становище в този срок се счита, че документите са съгласувани без забележки. Директорът на здравната инспекция уведомява заявителя за препоръките и, ако е необходимо, заявителят трябва да представи коригиран план за работа в срок от един месец. Разрешението се издава в срок от 5 дни след получаване на положително становище или на коригирания план. В случай на неизпълнение на препоръките, директорът на здравната инспекция може да откаже издаването на разрешение с мотивирано решение.\n\n\n\nРаздел VIII регулира курортните ресурси и курортите, като дефинира курортните ресурси като минерални води, лечебни пелоиди (лечебна кал), крайбрежната плажна ивица, морската вода и местности с благоприятни биоклиматични условия за профилактика, лечение и рехабилитация. Лечебните пелоиди включват лиманно-лагунни тини, изворни тини, езерна утаечна кал, торф и бентонитови глини. За ползването на минерални води за различни цели, като питейни, лечебни или рекреационни, министърът на здравеопазването или оправомощеното от него лице издава балнеологична оценка, която удостоверява състава, свойствата и начина на приложение на минералната вода. Тази оценка се издава на базата на предложение от директора на басейновата дирекция или кмета на общината, като се прилага резюме за хидрогеоложките условия и експлоатационните характеристики на водовземното съоръжение. Балнеологичната оценка се основава на анализи и проучвания, включващи хидрогеоложки условия, физични, химични, радиологични и микробиологични характеристики, както и фармакологичното и клинично въздействие на водата. Оценката е валидна за 10 години и може да бъде подновена по същия ред, като предложението за подновяване трябва да бъде подадено не по-късно от 6 месеца преди изтичането на срока ѝ. Всички издадени балнеологични оценки се публикуват на интернет страницата на Министерството на здравеопазването.\nКурортите се определят като урбанизирани територии с обявени курортни ресурси и възможности за изграждане на обекти за лечение, рехабилитация, отдих и туризъм. Обявяването на курортите се извършва по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването с решение на Министерския съвет, което се обнародва в “Държавен вестник”. Министърът на здравеопазването, в сътрудничество с други министри, определя с наредби условията и реда за обявяване, използване и опазване на курортните ресурси, зони и територии, както и за класификацията на курортите. Лечебните заведения имат приоритетно право да използват минерални води и лечебна кал за своята дейност, дори когато тези ресурси се отдават по Закона за концесиите.\nОсвен това, за опазване на живота и здравето на хората и превенция на водния травматизъм, се извършва обезопасяване на водните площи и басейните за обществено ползване, като се организира водноспасителна дейност. Изискванията за тази дейност и обезопасяването се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет."

    "text": "Глава трета, раздел I от закона регулира достъпността и качеството на медицинската помощ в Република България. Медицинската помощ се осъществява чрез прилагане на утвърдени от медицинската наука и практика методи и технологии, като това изискване се отнася и за медицински дейности, извършвани в чужбина по отношение на български граждани. Качеството на медицинската помощ се основава на медицински стандарти, утвърдени съгласно Закона за лечебните заведения, и на Правилата за добра медицинска практика, приети от съсловните организации на лекарите. Всеки български гражданин има право на достъпна медицинска помощ, която трябва да бъде своевременна, достатъчна и качествена, с приоритет за деца, бременни и майки на деца до 1 година. Основните принципи включват равнопоставеност, сътрудничество между лечебните заведения и зачитане на правата на пациента. Условията и редът за осъществяване на това право се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет.\nИзвън обхвата на задължителното здравно осигуряване, българските граждани имат право на медицински услуги, свързани със спешни състояния, интензивно лечение на здравно неосигурени лица, профилактични прегледи, стационарна психиатрична помощ, лечение със субституиращи програми, трансплантация на органи и други специфични медицински дейности. Тези услуги се финансират от държавния бюджет и общинските бюджети. Децата до 18 години имат право на медицинска помощ извън обхвата на задължителното здравно осигуряване, включително заплащане на медицински изделия, лекарствени продукти и диетични храни за специални медицински цели. Лечението на онкологични и редки заболявания, започнало преди навършване на 18 години, продължава да се финансира и след тази възраст.\nЧужденците с дългосрочно или постоянно пребиваване, бежанци, лица с хуманитарен статут и право на убежище, както и временно закриляни лица, имат право на медицинска помощ при същите условия като българските граждани. Чуждестранните студенти и докторанти, обучаващи се в България, също се ползват с медицинска помощ по същия ред. Чужденците, които пребивават краткосрочно или транзитно в страната, са длъжни да имат здравна осигуровка или застраховка, покриваща разходите за лечение. Изключение правят лицата, за които се прилагат правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност.\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни да осигурят на пациентите необходимите медицински изделия, като те се предоставят чрез болничните аптеки. Ако медицинските изделия не се заплащат от Националната здравноосигурителна каса или държавния бюджет, пациентите ги заплащат по цените на лечебното заведение. Гражданите на други държави – членки на Европейския съюз, които получават здравно обслужване в България, се ползват със същите методи и стандарти като българските граждани и заплащат стойността на услугите по същите цени.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона регулира правата и задълженията на пациента. Пациент е всяко лице, което е потърсило или на което се оказва медицинска помощ, като регистрацията му като пациент става с информирано съгласие, освен в случаите, предвидени със закон. На пациента се оказва здравна помощ независимо от възраст, пол, произход, език, национална, расова или политическа принадлежност, образование, убеждения, културно равнище, сексуална ориентация, лично, обществено или материално положение, увреждане и вид на заболяването.\nПациентът има право на зачитане на гражданските, политическите, икономическите, социалните, културните и религиозните му права, както и на достъпна и качествена здравна помощ. Той има право на повече от едно медицинско становище относно диагнозата, лечението и прогнозата на заболяването, както и на защита на данните, свързани с неговото здравословно състояние. Пациентът има право на ясна и достъпна информация за здравословното си състояние и методите за лечение, както и на достъп до модерни методи на лечение, предотвратяване на болката и страданието, и до медицинската документация. При хоспитализация пациентът има право да бъде посещаван от личния си лекар, да приема или отказва посетители, да ползва услугите на психотерапевт, юрист и свещенослужител, както и да получи информация за цената на медицинските услуги и лекарствените продукти.\nЗа защита на правата на пациента към министъра на здравеопазването се създава Обществен съвет по правата на пациента, който наблюдава и анализира дейностите, свързани с правата на пациента, изготвя доклади и предложения за промени в нормативната уредба. Представителни организации за защита на правата на пациентите могат да участват в работата на консултативни органи и да получават информация за проекти на нормативни актове.\nМедицинските дейности се осъществяват след изразено информирано съгласие от пациента. При непълнолетни или недееспособни лица съгласието се изразява от родител, настойник или попечител, освен в случаите, предвидени със закон. Пациентът има право да откаже предложената медицинска помощ, като отказът се удостоверява в медицинската документация. В случаите, когато е застрашен животът на пациента, ръководителят на лечебното заведение може да вземе решение за осъществяване на животоспасяващо лечение.\nПациентът има право да бъде информиран за здравословното си състояние, планираните лечебни дейности и рисковете, свързани с тях, както и да откаже да бъде информиран, освен когато здравословното му състояние застрашава други лица. Той може да подава жалби и сигнали до регионалната здравна инспекция при нарушаване на правата му, като регионалната здравна инспекция е длъжна да провери жалбата в 7-дневен срок и да предприеме съответните действия.\nПациентът е длъжен да се грижи за собственото си здраве, да не уврежда здравето на другите, да съдейства на медицинските специалисти и да спазва установения ред в лечебните заведения. При нелечими заболявания пациентът има право на палиативни медицински грижи, които включват медицинско наблюдение, здравни грижи и морална подкрепа. На територията на Република България не се прилага евтаназия.\nПри смърт на пациент в лечебно заведение се извършва патологоанатомична аутопсия, освен ако близките на починалия изрично поискат освобождаване от аутопсия. В случаите на смърт на дете, настанено извън семейството, аутопсията се извършва само ако детето е починало в лечебно заведение за болнична помощ.\n\n\n\nРаздел III от закона се занимава с медицинската помощ при спешни състояния. Държавата организира и финансира система за оказване на такава помощ, като спешно състояние се определя като остро или внезапно възникнала промяна в здравето на човека, която изисква незабавна медицинска намеса. Целта на медицинската помощ при спешни състояния е да предотврати смърт, тежки или необратими увреждания на жизнено важни органи и системи, както и усложнения при родилки, които застрашават здравето и живота на майката или плода.\nВсяко лице, намиращо се на мястото на инцидента, е длъжно да информира най-близкия център за спешна медицинска помощ, лечебно заведение или полицейско управление. Лечебните заведения са задължени да извършат необходимите медицински дейности при пациент в спешно състояние, независимо от неговото гражданство, адрес или здравноосигурителен статут. Ако лечебното заведение не може да осигури необходимия обем дейности, пациентът се транспортира до най-близкото подходящо лечебно заведение, при условие че състоянието му позволява това. При пренастаняване на пациента се използват всички медицински документи, обобщени в епикриза.\nТранспортирането на пациент не се допуска, ако то създава неоправдано висок риск за здравето и живота му. Това гарантира, че пациентите в спешни състояния получават необходимата помощ, като се избягват допълнителни рискове, свързани с транспортирането.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV от закона регулира медицинската експертиза, която включва установяване на временна неработоспособност, вида и степента на увреждане, степента на трайно намалена работоспособност и потвърждаване на професионални болести. Медицинската експертиза се организира и ръководи от министъра на здравеопазването и регионалните здравни инспекции. При извършване на експертиза се прави преценка и за възможността на лицето да се яви пред разследващите или съдебни органи, ако е необходимо. Видът и степента на увреждане се определят в проценти спрямо възможностите на здравия човек, като при определени дефинитивни състояния степента на трайно намалена работоспособност може да бъде определена пожизнено.\nМедицинската експертиза включва експертиза на временната неработоспособност, вида и степента на увреждане и трайно намалената работоспособност. Експертизата на временната неработоспособност се извършва от лекуващия лекар, лекарски консултативни комисии (ЛКК), териториални експертни лекарски комисии (ТЕЛК) и Националната експертна лекарска комисия (НЕЛК). Експертизата на вида и степента на увреждане и трайно намалената работоспособност се извършва от ТЕЛК и НЕЛК, като при децата до 16 години участва и специалист по детски болести. Срокът за извършване на експертизата е три месеца от подаване на заявлението.\nОрганите на медицинската експертиза представят данни за издадените болнични листове и решенията по обжалването им в Националния осигурителен институт. Лекарските консултативни комисии се разкриват и закриват от директорите на регионалните здравни инспекции, а териториалните експертни лекарски комисии са структурни звена на лечебните заведения. В съставите на ТЕЛК и НЕЛК работят лекари с призната специалност и не по-малко от 5 години трудов стаж. При извършване на експертиза не може да участва лекар, който е бил ангажиран с обжалваното решение или е в роднинска връзка с освидетелстваното лице.\nНационалната експертна лекарска комисия създава и поддържа информационна база данни за всички лица, преминали през ТЕЛК и НЕЛК, която включва данни за експертните решения, диагнози, извършени медико-диагностични дейности и други данни, от значение за трайно намалената работоспособност и вида и степента на увреждане. Тази база данни се използва за планиране на дейности, свързани с образованието, медицинската и социалната рехабилитация, трудовата заетост и оценка на здравния статус на населението.\nКонтрол върху медицинската експертиза се осъществява от Националния съвет по медицинска експертиза, министъра на здравеопазването, министъра на труда и социалната политика, НЗОК, НОИ и регионалните здравни инспекции. Регионалните съвети извършват проверки на експертните решения за временна неработоспособност и контролират дейността на лекуващите лекари, ЛКК и ТЕЛК. Обжалванията на експертните решения се подават пред съответните органи в определени срокове, като решенията на НЕЛК могат да бъдат обжалвани пред административния съд.\nРешенията на органите на медицинската експертиза са задължителни за всички лица, органи и организации в страната, след като редът за обжалване е изчерпан. Органите на медицинската експертиза могат да отменят или изменят неправилни решения на по-долустоящите органи, а ръководителят на НЕЛК може да разпореди преразглеждане на противоречиви решения.\n\n\n\nРаздел V от закона регулира медицинското осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи. Управлението, организацията и ресурсното осигуряване на здравната помощ в такива ситуации се осъществяват от министъра на здравеопазването, главния държавен здравен инспектор, директора на Националния център по радиационна и радиологична защита (НЦРРЗ), директорите на регионалните здравни инспекции, лечебните и здравните заведения. Тези органи провеждат дейността си в тясно взаимодействие с централната и местната власт, Министерството на вътрешните работи, неправителствени организации и Българския Червен кръст.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването разработва планове за медицинско осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи, които се утвърждават от Министерския съвет. На базата на тези планове се създават условия за медицинска сортировка, първична обработка, лечение, рехабилитация и медицинска експертиза на пострадалите. Те формират и подготвят органи за управление и екипи за медицинска помощ, осигуряват защитата на стационарно болните и медицинския персонал, организират противоепидемични и хигиенни дейности, формират запаси за ресурсно осигуряване и организират обучение на медицинските специалисти и населението. Финансовото осигуряване на тези дейности се осъществява от държавния бюджет.\nЗа осъществяване на медицинското осигуряване при бедствия, аварии и катастрофи към директора на регионалната здравна инспекция се създава съвет за медицинско осигуряване, който включва представители на регионалната здравна инспекция, директорите на лечебните заведения за болнична помощ, центъра за спешна медицинска помощ, областната администрация и общините в съответния регион. Този съвет приема регионалните планове за действие и програмите за обучение на медицинските екипи, работещи в условията на бедствия, аварии и катастрофи."

    "text": "Глава четвърта, раздел I от закона се занимава със здравната закрила на децата. Държавата, общините, юридическите и физическите лица създават условия за осигуряване на здравословна среда и нормално физическо и психическо развитие на децата. За подпомагане на семействата при отглеждането на деца до тригодишна възраст се създават детски ясли и детски кухни. Детските ясли са структури, в които медицински и други специалисти отглеждат, възпитават и обучават деца от тримесечна до тригодишна възраст, а детските кухни осигуряват храна за деца до тригодишна възраст. Изискванията към устройството и дейността на тези институции се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\nДетските ясли и кухни могат да се създават от общините, физически и юридически лица. Общинските детски ясли и кухни се създават, преобразуват и закриват със заповед на кмета на общината след решение на общинския съвет и съгласие на регионалната здравна инспекция. Издръжката на децата в общинските детски ясли и дейността на общинските детски кухни се финансират от общинския бюджет. Родителите заплащат такси за храна от детските кухни, определени от общинския съвет. Държавата предоставя средства на родителите за компенсиране на разходите за отглеждане на деца, които не са приети в общински детски ясли поради липса на места.\nЗдравните кабинети в детските градини и училищата осъществяват дейности по медицинско обслужване, подпомагане на деца с хронични заболявания, промоция на здравето, предотвратяване на заразни болести, организиране на здравно образование и участие в отдих и спорт. Тези дейности се извършват от лекари и медицински специалисти, които работят по договор с общината или собственика на частното учебно заведение. Финансирането на здравните кабинети в общинските и държавните училища и детски градини се извършва от общинските бюджети, докато в частните институции се финансира от собственика им.\nПри новооткрито заболяване или отклонение в развитието на детето здравните кабинети са задължени да уведомяват родителите и общопрактикуващия лекар. В рамките на учебните планове се осигурява обучение на учениците по лична хигиена, здравословно хранене, здравословен начин на живот, предпазване от инфекциозни болести, здравни рискове при употреба на тютюн, алкохол и наркотици, сексуално поведение и първа помощ.\nЗа осигуряване на профилактична медицинска и дентална помощ на децата и учениците веднъж годишно се извършват профилактични прегледи, които се финансират от Националната здравноосигурителна каса. Денталното лечение на деца от институции, управлявани от Министерството на образованието, Министерството на вътрешните работи и Министерството на правосъдието, се заплаща от съответните ведомства. За осигуряване на допълнително или специализирано медицинско обслужване на децата, заведенията могат да сключват договори с лечебни заведения за извънболнична помощ.\nМедицинските специалисти са длъжни да уведомят дирекция “Социално подпомагане” за всяко дете, родено в лечебно заведение, за което има риск от изоставяне, както и за деца, които са жертви на насилие.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона се занимава с репродуктивното здраве. Държавата осигурява здравна защита на репродуктивното здраве на гражданите чрез промоция и консултации за опазване на репродуктивното здраве, осигуряване на достъп до специализирана консултативна помощ, профилактика и лечение на безплодие, както и на предаваните по полов път болести и СПИН. Всеки гражданин има право на информация и свобода на решение относно своето репродуктивно здраве.\nЗа осигуряване на безрисково майчинство всяка жена има право на достъп до здравни дейности, насочени към осигуряване на оптимално здравословно състояние на жената и плода от началото на бременността до 42 дни след раждането. Тези здравни дейности включват промоция на здравето, профилактика на аборти и преждевременни раждания, обучение по хранене и грижи за новороденото, активно медицинско наблюдение на бременността, пренатална диагностика, осигуряване на оптимална жизнена среда за родилките и новородените, диспансерно наблюдение и свободен достъп до специализирана медицинска помощ. Бременните имат право да избират лечебно заведение за раждане.\nУсловията и редът за извършване на изкуствен аборт, както и критериите за жизнеспособност на плода, се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Същата наредба урежда и задълженията на медицинските специалисти при съмнение за аборт, извършен извън условията и реда на закона. Трайното отнемане на способността за репродукция също се извършва при условия и по ред, определени с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\n\n\n\nРаздел III от закона регулира асистираната репродукция, която се прилага, когато състоянието на мъжа или жената не позволява осъществяване на репродуктивните им функции по естествен път. Асистираната репродукция се извършва след получаване на писмено информирано съгласие от лицата, желаещи да създадат потомство, и след провеждане на медицински изследвания, гарантиращи здравето на потомството. Тя включва дейности като използване на медицински методи за оплождане на яйцеклетки, вземане, обработка и съхраняване на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи, както и поставяне на яйцеклетки в тялото на жената.\nЗа вземане на яйцеклетки от донор се изисква пълнолетие, писмено съгласие, информираност за рисковете и установено физическо и психическо здраве на донора. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да изготвят годишен отчет за извършените дейности и да го представят в Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”. Забранява се предлагането или приемането на материална облага за донорство на яйцеклетки или сперматозоиди.\nАсистираната репродукция се извършва от лечебни заведения, получили разрешение за тази дейност, и се контролира от Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”. Министърът на здравеопазването може да спре дейността на лечебно заведение, ако то не спазва изискванията на медицинския стандарт за асистирана репродукция. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да създадат и поддържат регистър за всички извършени дейности, свързани с асистираната репродукция, като данните се съхраняват 30 години.\nИзпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор” регистрира и анализира информацията за донорите, реципиентите и сериозните нежелани реакции или инциденти, свързани с асистираната репродукция. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да съобщят на агенцията за всички сериозни нежелани реакции или инциденти в 7-дневен срок и да създадат система за блокиране, изтегляне или унищожаване на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди или зиготи, които могат да доведат до рискове.\nЗабранява се изкуствено оплождане на яйцеклетка със сперматозоиди от донор, който е в кръвно родство с жената до четвърта степен. Износът и вносът на яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи се извършва при условията на Закона за трансплантация на органи, тъкани и клетки. Неизползвани яйцеклетки, сперматозоиди и зиготи могат да бъдат предоставяни за научни, учебни и лечебни цели след получаване на писмено съгласие от донорите.\nЗабранява се използването на техники за асистирана репродукция с цел подбор на пола на потомството, освен за предотвратяване на наследствени заболявания, свързани с пола. Също така се забранява репродуктивното клониране на хора и всяка форма на дискриминация, основана на генома на лицето.\n\n\n\nРаздел IV от закона се занимава с генетичното здраве и генетичните изследвания. Опазването на генетичното здраве се осъществява чрез профилактични и диагностични изследвания за доказване и класифициране на генетични заболявания, диспансеризация на лица с повишен риск, лечение на наследствени заболявания, установяване на наследствени признаци и идентифициране на родител, както и съхраняване на генетична информация. Профилактичните генетични изследвания се извършват за определяне на риска за генетични заболявания в потомството, идентифициране на клинично здрави носители на генетични отклонения и диагностика на наследствени заболявания преди, по време и след бременността.\nГенетичните изследвания в периода преди раждането се извършват при доказан риск за предаване на генетично заболяване и включват доказване на генетични отклонения, установяване на предразположения и анализ на генетични заболявания. За установяване на вида и честотата на генетичните отклонения и определяне на генетичния фонд се провеждат целеви проучвания. Генетичните изследвания и вземането на биологичен материал за медицински или научни цели се извършват само след писмено информирано съгласие от изследваните лица. При деца, лица с психични разстройства и лица под запрещение се изисква и разрешение от комисията по медицинска етика.\nРезултатите от генетичните изследвания не могат да бъдат основание за дискриминация, а данните за човешкия геном са лични и не могат да се предоставят на работодатели, здравноосигурителни организации или застрахователни компании. Генетичните изследвания се извършват от акредитирани генетични лаборатории към лечебни заведения или самостоятелни лаборатории. Министърът на здравеопазването определя Национална генетична лаборатория, която осъществява методическо ръководство и контрол върху генетичните лаборатории и създава национален генетичен регистър.\nЛечебните заведения информират Националната генетична лаборатория за проведените изследвания и резултатите от тях и създават служебен регистър на извършените изследвания. Генетичните лаборатории могат да създават ДНК банки за съхраняване на генетичен материал за научни и медицински цели, като ги регистрират в Министерството на здравеопазването. За установяване на вида и честотата на редките заболявания се създава национален регистър на пациентите с редки заболявания, като условията и редът за регистриране се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването. Същата наредба урежда и условията за участие на лечебни заведения в Европейските референтни мрежи и създаването на експертни центрове за редки болести."

    "text": "Глава пета, раздел I от закона се занимава със закрилата на психичното здраве. Държавата, общините и неправителствените организации организират дейности за опазване на психичното здраве, включително осигуряване на достъпна и качествена медицинска помощ за лица с психични разстройства, защита на психичното здраве при рискови групи, активна профилактика, подкрепа на обществените начинания и научноприложни изследвания. Общините осигуряват условия за психосоциална рехабилитация и подкрепа с финансови и материални средства, включително предоставяне на жилища за лица с психични разстройства.\nЛицата с психични разстройства, нуждаещи се от специални здравни грижи, включват тези с тежки психични нарушения, умствена изостаналост, деменция и други нарушения, които изискват медицинска помощ и подкрепа за пълноценен живот в семейството и социалната среда. Всяко лице с психично разстройство има право на лечение и грижи при равни условия с другите пациенти. Оценката за наличие на психично разстройство не може да се основава на семейни, професионални или други конфликти, нито на минали психични разстройства.\nМинистерството на здравеопазването създава и поддържа Национален служебен регистър на лица с психични разстройства, като редът и условията за ползване на данни от регистъра се определят с наредба. Основните принципи при лечението на лица с психични разстройства включват минимално ограничаване на личната свобода, намаляване на институционалната зависимост, изграждане на мрежа от специализирани заведения за извънболнична помощ и спазване на хуманитарните принципи.\nЛечението на лица с психични разстройства се извършва в лечебни заведения за първична или специализирана извънболнична помощ, стационарни психиатрични заведения, центрове за психично здраве и домове за медико-социални грижи. Забранява се използването на хирургични методи за промяна на централната нервна система с цел постигане на определени психични характеристики. При пациенти с психични разстройства, които представляват пряка опасност за себе си или другите, могат да се прилагат мерки за временно физическо ограничаване, но те не заместват активното лечение.\nТрудовата терапия е част от психосоциалните рехабилитационни програми, като е недопустима всякаква форма на експлоатация или принудителен труд. В социалните и интегрираните здравно-социални услуги за резидентна грижа се създават здравни кабинети, които осъществяват медицинско наблюдение, първа помощ и контрол върху хигиенните условия. Спешната психиатрична помощ се оказва от центрове за психично здраве, стационарни психиатрични заведения и центрове за спешна медицинска помощ.\nКогато състоянието на лице с психично разстройство налага продължаване на лечението след овладяване на спешното състояние, ръководителят на лечебното заведение може да настани лицето временно за лечение за срок до 24 часа, като уведомява близките. При необходимост от задължително лечение се внася мотивирано искане в съда, придружено от становище на психиатър.\n\n\n\nРаздел II от закона регулира задължителното настаняване и лечение на лица с психични разстройства, които поради заболяването си могат да извършат престъпления, представляващи опасност за себе си, близките или обществото. Задължителното настаняване и лечение се постановява с решение на районния съд по настоящия адрес на лицето или по местонахождението на лечебното заведение. Лечението се осъществява в лечебни заведения за стационарна психиатрична помощ, центрове за психично здраве, психиатрични отделения или клиники към многопрофилни болници.\nИскането за задължително настаняване и лечение може да бъде подадено от прокурора или от ръководителя на лечебното заведение. Съдът изпраща преписи от искането на лицето, което може да направи възражения и да представи доказателства в 7-дневен срок. Делото се разглежда в открито заседание с участието на лицето, психиатър, защитник и прокурор. Ако здравословното състояние на лицето не позволява присъствие в заседанието, съдът може да придобие непосредствено впечатление за състоянието му или да позволи участие чрез видеоконференция.\nСъдът назначава съдебно-психиатрична експертиза, за да установи наличието на психично разстройство и да определи необходимостта от задължително лечение. Експертизата се провежда в срок до 14 дни, като съдът може да удължи срока с до 10 дни при необходимост.\nСлед изслушване на заключението на експертизата, съдът се произнася с решение за задължително настаняване и лечение, определя лечебното заведение, срока и формата на лечението (амбулаторно или стационарно). Ако лицето не е способно да изрази информирано съгласие, съдът назначава близък или представител на общинската служба по здравеопазване, който да изрази съгласие за лечението.\nРешението на съда може да бъде обжалвано в 7-дневен срок, като обжалването спира изпълнението на решението, освен ако съдът постанови друго. Задължителното лечение се прекратява с изтичане на срока или с решение на съда при отпадане на предпоставките за лечение. На всеки три месеца съдът служебно преразглежда необходимостта от задължително настаняване и лечение въз основа на нова съдебно-психиатрична експертиза.\nВлязлото в сила решение за задължително настаняване и лечение се изпълнява от лечебните заведения, като при необходимост се осигурява съдействието на органите на Министерството на вътрешните работи."

    "text": "Раздел IV от закона регулира медицинските научни изследвания върху хора и медицинската наука. Министерството на здравеопазването организира и контролира провеждането на такива изследвания, като те трябва да отговарят на строги етични и правни стандарти. Медицинското научно изследване се определя като всеки опит върху хора, целящ повишаване на медицинското познание, като изследваното лице има всички права на пациент. Безопасността на здравето на участниците и запазването на тайната на личните им данни са задължителни. Интересите на изследваното лице винаги са с приоритет пред научните и финансовите интереси на изследователите.\nМедицинските научни изследвания върху хора са забранени в случаи, когато противоречат на закона или медицинската етика, когато няма доказателства за безопасност или очаквани научни ползи, или когато съществува повишен риск за здравето и живота на участниците. Забранени са също изследвания с химически субстанции, физични източници на лъчение или продукти на генното инженерство, които могат да доведат до изменения в човешкия геном или предаване на нови признаци в потомството.\nУчастието в медицински научни изследвания изисква писмено информирано съгласие от дееспособно лице, което разбира същността, значението и рисковете от изследването. Съгласието може да бъде оттеглено по всяко време. Изследванията не се провеждат върху недееспособни лица, бременни, кърмачки или лица, лишени от свобода, освен ако не се очакват значителни ползи за здравето.\nРъководителят на медицинското научно изследване носи солидарна отговорност за вредите, причинени на участниците, и е длъжен да сключи застраховка, покриваща тази отговорност. Условията и редът за застраховането се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет. Ръководителят на изследването трябва да бъде лекар или лекар по дентална медицина с призната специалност, а изследванията се провеждат от квалифицирани специалисти с висше образование в областта на медицината, денталната медицина, фармацията, биологията или биохимията.\nМедицинските научни изследвания се провеждат след положително становище от местна комисия по етика, учредена в лечебното или научното заведение. Комисията упражнява контрол върху провеждането на изследванията и може да предложи прекратяването им при установени пропуски или нарушения. Ръководителят на изследването е длъжен да информира комисията при завършване или преустановяване на изследването.\nМедицинското научно изследване може да бъде преустановено при оттегляне на съгласието на участника, при установяване на вредно въздействие върху здравето му или по предложение на ръководителя на изследването или на председателя на местната комисия по етика. Прекратяването на изследването се извършва със заповед на директора на регионалната здравна инспекция.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването определя условията и реда за провеждане на медицинските научни изследвания и ежегодно обявява конкурси за научни проекти по държавните научни приоритети в областта на медицината. Научните проекти се финансират чрез държавни субсидии и други източници.\nТялото на починало лице може да се използва за обучение и научни изследвания във висшите медицински училища при изразено писмено съгласие от лицето приживе или от близките му след смъртта му. Висшите медицински училища поемат разходите по погребението на починалото лице в определени случаи. Редът за използване на телата на починалите за обучение и изследвания се определя с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването."

Задължителното здравно осигуряване гарантира свободен достъп на осигурените лица до медицинска помощ чрез определен пакет от здравни дейности, както и свободен избор на изпълнител на медицинска помощ, сключил договор с районна здравноосигурителна каса (РЗОК). Правото на избор е валидно за цялата територия на страната и не може да бъде ограничавано по географски или административни основания. Условията и редът за упражняване на това право се уреждат в наредби и национални рамкови договори.\nНационалният рамков договор е нормативен административен акт, който има действие на територията на цялата страна за определен срок и е задължителен за Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК), районните здравноосигурителни каси (РЗОК), изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, осигурените лица и осигурителите.\nЗадължителното здравно осигуряване се осъществява на основата на следните принципи:\n\nЗадължително участие при набирането на здравноосигурителни вноски.\nУчастие на държавата, осигурените и работодателите в управлението на НЗОК.\nСолидарност на осигурените при ползването на набраните средства.\nОтговорност на осигурените за собственото им здраве.\nРавнопоставеност при ползването на медицинска помощ.\nРавнопоставеност на изпълнителите на медицинска помощ при сключване на договори с РЗОК.\nСамоуправление на НЗОК.\nДоговаряне на взаимоотношенията между НЗОК и изпълнителите на медицинска помощ.\nПакет от здравни дейности, гарантиран от бюджета на НЗОК.\nСвободен избор от осигурените на изпълнители на медицинска помощ.\nПубличност в дейността на НЗОК и публичен контрол върху извършваните от нея разходи.\n\nТези принципи гарантират, че задължителното здравно осигуряване е справедливо, прозрачно и достъпно за всички осигурени лица, като същевременно осигурява качествена медицинска помощ и ефективно управление на здравните ресурси.\n\n\nРаздел II Национална здравноосигурителна каса\nРаздел II от закона се занимава с Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК), която е основният орган, отговорен за осъществяването на задължителното здравно осигуряване в Република България. НЗОК е юридическо лице със седалище в София и се състои от централно управление, районни здравноосигурителни каси (РЗОК) и техните поделения. Седалищата на РЗОК се определят от Министерския съвет, а тези на поделенията – със заповед на управителя на НЗОК.\nОрганите на управление на НЗОК са:\n\nНадзорният съвет – съставен от 9 члена, включително представители на организации за защита на правата на пациентите, работници, служители, работодатели и държавата. Надзорният съвет отговаря за контрола върху дейността на НЗОК, одобрява бюджета и финансовите отчети, както и за сключването на национални рамкови договори (НРД).\nУправителят и подуправителят – избирани от Народното събрание за срок от 5 години. Управителят ръководи оперативната дейност на НЗОК, изготвя бюджета и финансовите отчети, сключва договори и организира дейността на РЗОК. Подуправителят подпомага управителя и временно изпълнява неговите функции при необходимост.\n\nНЗОК не може да извършва доброволно здравно осигуряване. Служителите в централното управление и РЗОК заемат длъжности по служебно или трудово правоотношение, като за тях се прилагат разпоредбите на Кодекса на труда.\n\nНадзорен съвет\nНадзорният съвет се състои от представители на пациентски организации, работници, служители, работодатели и държавата. Той отговаря за:\n\nПриемане на правилника за устройството и дейността на НЗОК.\nУчастие в изготвянето и приемането на НРД.\nОдобряване на бюджета и финансовите отчети на НЗОК.\nКонтрол върху дейността на управителя и директорите на РЗОК.\nУтвърждаване на механизми за устойчивост на бюджета на НЗОК.\n\nЧленовете на надзорния съвет не получават възнаграждение за участие в заседанията му. Забранява се членството на лица, които са народни представители, министри, членове на управителни органи на лечебни заведения или търговски дружества, свързани с лекарствени продукти.\n\n\nУправител и подуправител\nУправителят и подуправителят на НЗОК се избират от Народното събрание за срок от 5 години. Управителят отговаря за:\n\nПредставянето на НЗОК в страната и чужбина.\nОрганизирането и ръководенето на оперативната дейност на НЗОК.\nИзготвянето на бюджета и финансовите отчети.\nСключването на договори с изпълнители на медицинска помощ.\nПровеждането на конкурси за директори на РЗОК.\n\nПодуправителят подпомага управителя и временно изпълнява неговите функции при отсъствие или прекратяване на мандата му.\n\n\nДиректори на РЗОК\nДиректорите на РЗОК се избират чрез конкурс и отговарят за:\n\nПредставянето на НЗОК на териториално равнище.\nОрганизирането и ръководенето на дейността на РЗОК.\nСключването на договори с изпълнители на медицинска помощ.\nЗакупуването на здравни дейности в рамките на одобрения бюджет.\n\nДиректорите на РЗОК трябва да имат висше образование и минимум три години стаж в областта на управлението на здравеопазването, банковото или застрахователното дело.\n\n\nЗабрани и ограничения\nЗабранява се назначаването на лица за управител, подуправител или директор на РЗОК, които:\n\nНе са български граждани.\nСа осъждани за умишлено престъпление или лишени от правото да заемат материалноотговорни длъжности.\nСа членове на надзорния съвет или са свързани с търговски дружества, занимаващи се с доброволно здравно осигуряване.\nСа народни представители, министри или кметове на общини.\n\nЛицата, заемащи длъжности в НЗОК и РЗОК, не могат да извършват конкурентна дейност или да бъдат изпълнители на медицинска помощ.\n\n\n\nРаздел III Финансово устройство на Националната здравноосигурителна каса\nРаздел III от закона урежда финансовото устройство на Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК). Бюджетът на НЗОК е отделен от държавния бюджет и представлява основен финансов план за набиране и разходване на средства за задължителното здравно осигуряване. Годишната стойност на разходите за медицинска помощ, изплащана от НЗОК, е неразделна част от бюджета ѝ.\nПриходите на НЗОК включват осигурителни вноски, трансфери от държавния бюджет, лихви от управление на имущество, възстановяване на разходи, глоби, такси, дарения и други източници. В случай на недостиг на средства, НЗОК може да ползва краткосрочни безлихвени заеми от държавния бюджет. Трансферите от държавния бюджет се използват за финансиране на специфични здравни дейности, включително медицински изделия и помощни средства за хора с увреждания.\nСредствата на НЗОК се разходват за закупуване на медицинска помощ, административни разходи, издаване на документи, инвестиционни разходи, медицинска помощ в съответствие с правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност, както и за заплащане на лекарствени продукти и медицински изделия. В бюджета на НЗОК задължително се предвижда резерв за непредвидени и неотложни разходи, който се определя като процент от събраните приходи.\nВременно свободните средства на НЗОК се съхраняват в Българската народна банка или се влагат в държавни ценни книжа. Управителят на НЗОК е първостепенен разпоредител със средствата, а директорите на районните здравноосигурителни каси (РЗОК) са второстепенни разпоредители.\nУправителят на НЗОК внася проект на закон за бюджета на НЗОК в Министерския съвет, който се разглежда от Народното събрание едновременно с държавния бюджет. Бюджетът на НЗОК включва разходи за първична и специализирана медицинска помощ, дентална помощ, медико-диагностични дейности, лекарствени продукти, медицински изделия и болнична помощ. В случай, че бюджетът не бъде приет навреме, се използват разходите от предходната година.\nГодишният отчет за изпълнение на бюджета и отчетът за дейността на НЗОК се внасят в Народното събрание не по-късно от 30 юни следващата година. НЗОК не може да притежава лечебни заведения или аптеки, но осъществява събирането и контрола на отчетите на изпълнителите на болнична медицинска помощ.\n\n\nРаздел IV Осигурени лица. Права и задължения\nРаздел IV от закона урежда правата и задълженията на осигурените лица в Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК). Задължително осигурени са българските граждани, които не са граждани на друга държава, както и тези, които са граждани на друга държава, но постоянно живеят в България. Освен това, задължителното осигуряване се отнася и за чуждестранни граждани или лица без гражданство с разрешение за дългосрочно или постоянно пребиваване, лица с предоставен статут на бежанец или хуманитарен статут, чуждестранни студенти и докторанти, както и лица, за които се прилага българското законодателство според правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност. Лицата, които се осигуряват в друга държава членка на ЕС, не са задължени да се осигуряват в НЗОК.\nЗадължението за осигуряване възниква от момента на раждането за новородените, от датата на получаване на разрешение за пребиваване за чужденците, от датата на записване в учебно заведение за студентите и докторантите, както и от датата на възникване на основанието за осигуряване за други лица. Правата на осигурените възникват от момента на заплащане на здравноосигурителната вноска, с изключение на новородените и лицата с предоставен статут на бежанец или хуманитарен статут, които получават правата си от момента на откриване на производство за предоставяне на статута.\nОсигурените лица имат право на медицинска помощ в обхвата на пакета от здравни дейности, гарантиран от бюджета на НЗОК, както и право на избор на лекар за първична медицинска помощ. Те имат право на спешна помощ, информация за договорите на РЗОК с изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, участие в управлението на НЗОК и подаване на жалби при нарушения. Освен това, те могат да получат документи, необходими за упражняване на здравноосигурителните им права в съответствие с правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност.\nЗа всяко посещение при лекаря или лекаря по дентална медицина, както и за всеки ден болнично лечение, осигурените заплащат определени суми, освен ако не са освободени от плащане. Освободени от плащане са малолетните, непълнолетните и неработещите членове на семейството, ветерани от войните, военноинвалидите, социално слабите лица и други категории, определени със закон.\nОсигурените са длъжни да изпълняват предписанията на изпълнителите на медицинска помощ и изискванията за профилактика на заболяванията. Данните за задължително осигурените лица се подават ежемесечно в Националната агенция за приходите, а лицата, които внасят осигурителни вноски, подават декларации за дължимите суми. Чужденците, които не се осигуряват по реда на закона, заплащат стойността на оказаната им медицинска помощ, освен ако има в сила международен договор. Здравноосигурителният статус на осигурените се формира въз основа на данни от декларации, регистри и внесените здравноосигурителни вноски.\n\n\nРаздел V Здравноосигурителни вноски\nРаздел V от закона урежда здравноосигурителните вноски, които се внасят за осигуряване на здравното покритие на гражданите. Здравноосигурителната вноска се определя върху доход и се внася от различни категории осигурени лица, включително работници, самоосигуряващи се лица, пенсионери, студенти, лица с увреждания и други. Вноските се изчисляват върху определени доходи, като минималният осигурителен доход за самоосигуряващите се лица, и се внасят в определени срокове, обикновено до 25-о число на месеца, следващ този, за който се отнасят.\nЗа работниците и служителите здравноосигурителната вноска се разпределя между работодателя и осигуреното лице в съотношение, което се променя през годините. Работодателят е длъжен да внася вноските в съответните срокове. Самоосигуряващите се лица, като земеделски стопани и тютюнопроизводители, внасят вноските авансово върху минималния осигурителен доход, а окончателното изравняване се извършва в края на годината. Пенсионерите се осигуряват за сметка на държавния бюджет, като вноските се изчисляват върху размера на пенсията.\nЛицата, които не подлежат на осигуряване по други основания, могат да се осигурят доброволно, като внасят вноски върху осигурителен доход, не по-малък от половината от минималния размер на осигурителния доход за самоосигуряващите се лица. Те са длъжни да подават декларации и да внасят вноските в определените срокове. В случай на неизпълнение, може да бъде издаден акт за установяване на задължението.\nБългарските граждани, които пребивават в чужбина повече от 183 дни в годината, могат да декларират, че не дължат здравноосигурителни вноски, но при завръщане в страната трябва да възстановят осигурителните си права чрез заплащане на вноски за определен период. Лицата, които се осигуряват по схемата за здравно застраховане на Европейския съюз, не заплащат здравноосигурителни вноски, но заплащат оказаната им медицинска помощ по цени, определени от лечебното заведение.\nОсигурителните вноски се внасят по съответната сметка на Националната агенция за приходите. В случай на наличие на няколко публични задължения, самоосигуряващите се лица могат да заявят кои задължения за осигурителни вноски погасяват. Осигурителният доход се установява на базата на документи за изплатени или начислени възнаграждения, пенсионни картони, болнични листове и данъчни декларации. Здравноосигурителната вноска не подлежи на данъчно облагане.\nНабраните от здравноосигурителни вноски приходи се използват само за осъществяване на дейностите, посочени в закона, включително закупуване на медицинска помощ, административни разходи и други здравноосигурителни плащания.\n\n\nРаздел VI Обхват на медицинска помощ при задължителното здравно осигуряване\nРаздел VI определя обхвата на медицинската помощ, която се заплаща от Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК) в рамките на задължителното здравно осигуряване. Той включва различни видове медицински и дентални услуги, като превенция, диагностика, лечение, рехабилитация, неотложна помощ, грижи по време на бременност и раждане, както и предоставяне на лекарства и медицински изделия. НЗОК също така заплаща транспортни услуги по медицински показания и специализирани медицински дейности, включително за хора с увреждания.\nМедицинската помощ се определя като пакет, гарантиран от бюджета на НЗОК, и се регулира със специфични наредби, издадени от министъра на здравеопазването. Списъкът на заболяванията, за които се заплаща домашно лечение, се определя от Надзорния съвет на НЗОК и се публикува в “Държавен вестник”. Промените в този списък, които увеличават разходите на НЗОК, влизат в сила след одобрение в закона за бюджета на касата.\nНЗОК сключва договори с производители и търговци на лекарствени продукти и медицински изделия, като се договарят отстъпки и условия за заплащане. За лекарствените продукти и медицинските изделия, използвани в болничната помощ, се прилага механизъм за гарантиране на предвидимост и устойчивост на бюджета на НЗОК. Този механизъм включва ежегодно договаряне на цени и условия за заплащане, като при липса на договорени отстъпки, НЗОК не заплаща съответните продукти.\nИзпълнителите на медицинска помощ са задължени да предоставят услугите без допълнително заплащане от пациентите, спазвайки медицинските стандарти и правилата за добра практика. Неосигурените лица заплащат медицинската помощ по цени, определени от лечебните заведения. НЗОК не покрива разходите за клинични изпитвания на лекарствени продукти и медицински изделия, както и услуги, които не са включени в гарантирания пакет.\n\n\nРаздел VII Национален рамков договор\nРаздел VII регулира Националния рамков договор (НРД), който се сключва между Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК) и съсловните организации на лекарите и зъболекарите. Този договор определя условията за предоставяне на медицински и дентални услуги в рамките на задължителното здравно осигуряване. НРД се приема за срок от три години и може да се актуализира ежегодно чрез анекси, които предоговарят условията, обемите и цените на медицинските услуги.\nНРД включва условия за сключване на договори с изпълнители на медицинска помощ, видовете медицински услуги, които се предоставят, критерии за качество и достъпност на помощта, както и санкции при неизпълнение на договорените условия. Договорите също така уреждат въпроси като документооборота, информационния обмен и контрола върху изпълнението на договорите.\nНЗОК планира и закупува медицинска помощ за здравноосигурените лица в рамките на обемите, определени в НРД, и в съответствие с бюджета на касата за съответната година. Лекарите и зъболекарите, работещи в лечебни заведения, са задължени да предписват лекарствени продукти и медицински изделия съгласно утвърдените фармако-терапевтични ръководства, като се взема предвид разходната ефективност на терапията.\nНРД не може да съдържа изисквания, които ограничават свободния избор на пациентите или налагат допълнителни изисквания за аптеки и производители на лекарства, освен тези, предвидени в закона. Промените в НРД се извършват с анекси, които се приемат по същия ред като самия договор.\nВ случай, че НРД не бъде приет в определения срок, се прилагат действащите до момента договори и анекси. Ако законодателни промени налагат промени в НРД, те се определят с решение на Надзорния съвет на НЗОК и се обнародват в “Държавен вестник”.\n\n\nРаздел VIII Договор между Националната здравноосигурителна каса и изпълнител на медицинска помощ\nРаздел VIII регулира договорните отношения между Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК) и изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, които включват лечебни заведения и техни обединения. Договорите се сключват между директора на Районната здравноосигурителна каса (РЗОК) и изпълнителите на медицинска помощ в съответствие с Националния рамков договор (НРД) и приложимите закони. Тези договори определят условията за предоставяне на медицинска помощ, включително обемите, цените и методиките за заплащане.\nДоговорите се сключват за срок, съответстващ на срока на действие на НРД или на анексите към него и могат да бъдат актуализирани при промени в законодателството или при необходимост. В случай на неизпълнение на договорените условия, директорът на РЗОК може да прекрати договора или да наложи финансови санкции. Договорите не могат да бъдат сключени при условия, по-неизгодни от тези, предвидени в НРД.\nИзпълнителите на медицинска помощ трябва да отговарят на определени критерии за достъпност и качество на медицинската помощ, включително обезпеченост с медицински специалисти, наличие на необходимата медицинска апаратура и спазване на медицинските стандарти. Лечебните заведения за болнична помощ могат да сключват договори само за дейности, за които разполагат със специалисти на основен трудов договор, с изключение на определени специалности, където е разрешен допълнителен труд.\nНЗОК и РЗОК са длъжни да информират изпълнителите за промени в законодателството или в НРД и да предоставят необходимите указания за тяхното прилагане. В случай на несъответствие с критериите за качество и достъпност, финансирането на лечебните заведения може да бъде променено или прекратено.\nДоговорите могат да бъдат сключвани и с лекари на извънболнична практика, които имат договор с болница, при условие че на същата територия няма достатъчно лекари от същата специалност. Преценката за недостатъчност се извършва от регионалната здравна инспекция въз основа на потребностите от медицинска помощ, определени в Националната здравна карта.\nНаучната дейност и обучението на медицински специалисти не са обект на договаряне и заплащане от страна на НЗОК.\n\n\nРаздел IХ Информационно осигуряване на дейността на Националната здравноосигурителна каса\nРаздел IX регулира информационното осигуряване на дейността на Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК). Той включва изграждането и поддържането на информационна система, която съдържа регистри на осигурените лица, изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, производителите и дистрибуторите на лекарства, както и друга административна информация, необходима за функционирането на здравното осигуряване. НЗОК е длъжна да осигурява достъп до тази информация на Министерството на здравеопазването, както и на самите осигурени лица, които имат право да получават информация за ползваната от тях медицинска помощ.\nИнформационната система включва:\n\nРегистър на осигурените лица, който съдържа лични данни, уникален идентификационен номер, основание за осигуряване, заплатени вноски и информация за медицинска помощ, оказана в друга държава членка на ЕС.\nРегистър на изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, включващ данни за лечебните заведения, сключените с тях договори и професионалните данни на лекарите.\nРегистър на производители и дистрибутори на лекарства, както и на аптеки, сключили договори с НЗОК.\nИнформация от контролните органи и административна информация, необходима за дейността на НЗОК.\n\nОсигурените лица имат право да получат информация за ползваната от тях медицинска помощ през последните пет години, както и информация за изпълнителите на медицинска помощ и аптеките в съответния регион. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да предоставят публична информация за здравните дейности, гарантирани от бюджета на НЗОК, както и за безплатните и платените медицински услуги.\nИзпълнителите на медицинска помощ са длъжни да предоставят на НЗОК информация за извършената от тях дейност в съответствие с условията и реда, определени в Националния рамков договор (НРД). Данните се съхраняват в информационната система на НЗОК за период от 5 години след прекратяване на здравното осигуряване или договора с изпълнителя.\nНЗОК има право да използва данните за осигурените лица и изпълнителите само за конкретни цели, като установяване на осигурителното отношение, разплащане с изпълнители, изготвяне на здравноосигурителни документи и упражняване на финансов и медицински контрол. Данните могат да бъдат предоставени на държавни органи само ако това е предвидено със закон.\nСлужителите на НЗОК и РЗОК нямат право да разпространяват лични данни на осигурените лица или изпълнителите на медицинска помощ, освен в случаите, предвидени със закон. Те също така нямат право да дават професионална оценка на дейността на изпълнителите или да насочват пациенти към конкретни лечебни заведения.\nНЗОК и РЗОК са длъжни да предоставят исканата от Министерството на здравеопазването информация, като за целта се сключва споразумение, което определя реда и условията за предоставяне на данните. Министерството на здравеопазването също предоставя информация на НЗОК при сключване на рамкови споразумения за обществени поръчки.\nНационалната агенция за приходите предоставя информация на Министерството на здравеопазването и НЗОК за осигурените лица, размера на събраните здравноосигурителни вноски и тенденциите за тяхната събираемост.\n\n\nРаздел Х Контрол, експертиза и спорове\nРаздел X регулира контрола, експертизата и разрешаването на спорове, свързани с дейността на Националната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК). Той включва механизми за финансов и медицински контрол, експертиза и процедури за разрешаване на спорове между НЗОК и изпълнителите на медицинска помощ.\n\nКонтрол\n\nФинансов контрол: Контролът върху изпълнението на бюджета на НЗОК се осъществява от Сметната палата. Сметната палата изразява становище и за прилагането на механизмите, гарантиращи предвидимост и устойчивост на бюджета на НЗОК. Министърът на здравеопазването може да предложи промени в тези механизми въз основа на докладите на Сметната палата.\nКонтрол върху изпълнителите: Контролът върху изпълнението на договорите с изпълнителите на медицинска и дентална помощ се осъществява от служители на НЗОК и РЗОК. Те извършват планови и внезапни проверки, включително по жалби от здравноосигурени лица. При установяване на нарушения се съставят протоколи, които се предоставят на изпълнителя и се изпращат на управителя на НЗОК и съответната съсловна организация.\nСанкции: При потвърждаване на нарушенията от арбитражна комисия, управителят на НЗОК или директорът на РЗОК издава заповед за налагане на санкции. Санкциите могат да включват финансови наказания или прекратяване на договорите.\n\n\n\nЕкспертиза\nНЗОК може да извършва експертиза в случаи, когато стойността на медицинската помощ надхвърля определена сума или когато става въпрос за скъпоструващи лекарствени продукти. Експертизата се извършва от комисии в централното управление на НЗОК или РЗОК в срок до два месеца от постъпване на заявлението.\n\n\nСпорове\n\nАрбитражна комисия: Споровете между НЗОК и изпълнителите на медицинска помощ се решават от арбитражна комисия, съставена от представители на РЗОК, съсловните организации на лекарите, фармацевтите и други медицински специалисти. Ако комисията не се произнесе в определен срок или не се достигне до решение, управителят на НЗОК или директорът на РЗОК може да наложи санкции чрез мотивирана заповед.\nСъдебен ред: Ако не се постигне съгласие чрез арбитраж, споровете се решават по съдебен ред.\n\n\n\nВъзстановяване на неоснователно получени суми\nВ случай, че изпълнителят на медицинска помощ е получил суми без правно основание, той е длъжен да ги възстанови. Това може да стане или по покана от управителя на НЗОК, или след налагане на санкция. Поканите за възстановяване на суми подлежат на обжалване по административен ред.\n\n\nОбщи разпоредби\nФизическите и юридическите лица са длъжни да предоставят на контролните органи на НЗОК и Националната агенция за приходите всички необходими документи и информация, свързани с здравното осигуряване, и да оказват съдействие при изпълнение на служебните им задължения.\n\n\n\nРаздел ХI Издаване на документи, необходими за упражняване на здравноосигурителни права съгласно правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност\nРаздел XI регулира издаването на документи, необходими за упражняване на здравноосигурителни права в съответствие с правилата за координация на системите за социална сигурност в рамките на Европейския съюз, Европейското икономическо пространство и Швейцария. Този раздел е въведен с цел да улесни гражданите на България да получават медицинска помощ в чужбина, както и да гарантира, че те имат достъп до необходимите документи за упражняване на своите здравноосигурителни права.\n\nИздаване на документи\nНационалната здравноосигурителна каса (НЗОК) е отговорна за издаването на документи, необходими за упражняване на здравноосигурителни права в чужбина. Тези документи се издават в срок от 30 дни от датата на подаване на искане от заинтересованото лице. Искането се подава чрез Районната здравноосигурителна каса (РЗОК). Министърът на здравеопазването, по предложение на управителя на НЗОК, определя с наредба реда за издаване на тези документи.\n\n\nЕвропейска здравноосигурителна карта\nЕвропейската здравноосигурителна карта (ЕЗОК) е един от основните документи, които се издават. Тя позволява на българските граждани да получават медицинска помощ в държавите членки на Европейския съюз, Европейското икономическо пространство и Швейцария при временно пребиваване. Картата се издава със следните срокове на валидност:\n\nЗа обикновени граждани – срокът на валидност е една година.\nЗа непълнолетни лица – срокът на валидност е до навършване на пълнолетие, но не по-малко от една година и не повече от 5 години.\nЗа пенсионери – срокът на валидност е 10 години, а за получаващи пенсия за инвалидност – за срока на пенсията, но не повече от 10 години.\n\n\n\nОбявяване на картата за невалидна\nЕвропейската здравноосигурителна карта може да бъде обявена за невалидна в следните случаи:\n\nАко здравноосигуреното лице съобщи, че картата е изгубена, открадната или унищожена.\nАко здравноосигуреното лице е починало.\nАко лицето е загубило правото на НЗОК да заплати за медицинска помощ, освен ако до датата на обявяването на картата за невалидна не е възстановило здравноосигурителните си права.\n\n\n\n\nРаздел XІІ Трансгранично здравно обслужване\n\nОбщи разпоредби\nЗдравноосигурените лица имат право на достъп до безопасно и висококачествено трансгранично здравно обслужване, независимо от начина на организация, предоставяне и финансиране. Трансграничното здравно обслужване се определя като здравно обслужване, предоставено или предписано в държава членка на Европейския съюз, различна от държавата по осигуряване. Правото на трансгранично здравно обслужване се упражнява, когато обслужването е включено в пакета здравни дейности, финансирани от бюджета на НЗОК или Министерството на здравеопазването.\n\n\nОграничения на правото\nПравото на трансгранично здравно обслужване не включва: предоставяне на органи за трансплантация, дългосрочни грижи за пациенти с хронични увреждания, дейности по национални и общински имунизационни програми, както и случаи, при които се прилагат механизми за координация на системите за социална сигурност или действащи двустранни спогодби.\n\n\nФинансиране и възстановяване на разходи\nЗдравноосигурените лица заплащат стойността на предоставеното трансгранично здравно обслужване в държавата членка по местолечение. Те имат право на възстановяване на разходите до размера, който НЗОК или Министерството на здравеопазването заплащат за съответното обслужване в България, но не повече от действително направените разходи. Възстановяването не се отнася за обслужване, предоставено в България от лечебни заведения, които не са сключили договори с НЗОК или не се финансират от бюджета на Министерството на здравеопазването.\n\n\nПредварително разрешение\nЗа някои здравни услуги, лекарствени продукти и медицински изделия се изисква предварително разрешение. То може да се изисква при обслужване, което е зависимо от изисквания за планиране, излага пациента или населението на риск, или се предоставя от лечебно заведение със съмнения относно качеството и безопасността. НЗОК или Министерството на здравеопазването проверяват изпълнението на условията по Регламент (ЕО) № 883/2004 и отказват предварително разрешение при наличие на риск за пациента или населението, както и когато обслужването може да бъде предоставено в България в обоснован срок.\n\n\nНационална точка за контакт\nНЗОК изпълнява функциите на национална точка за контакт по въпросите на трансграничното здравно обслужване. Тя предоставя информация на пациентите, осъществява връзка с други национални точки за контакт и Европейската комисия. Министерството на здравеопазването, регионалните здравни инспекции, лечебните заведения и съсловните организации предоставят необходимата информация за изпълнение на функциите на националната точка за контакт.\n\n\nИнформационни задължения\nИнституциите, включително Българският лекарски съюз и Българската асоциация на професионалистите по здравни грижи, предоставят информация относно правата и ограниченията на медицинските специалисти в двудневен срок от искането. Условията и редът за предоставяне на информация се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\n\n\nОбжалване на откази\nОтказът за предварително разрешение, издаден от министъра на здравеопазването, подлежи на обжалване пред съответния административен съд по реда на Административнопроцесуалния кодекс."

Договорите за медицинска застраховка, сключени по повод на пътувания извън територията на Република България, не се считат за доброволно здравно осигуряване. Също така, дейността на изпълнители на медицинска помощ по договори с физически и юридически лица за извършване на медицински услуги с определен вид, обем и цени не се квалифицира като доброволно здравно осигуряване.\n\nДейности по доброволно здравно осигуряване\nДейност по доброволно здравно осигуряване могат да осъществяват застрахователни акционерни дружества, лицензирани за съответните видове застраховки. Застрахователите имат право да изискват от изпълнителите на медицинска помощ и доставчиците на здравни стоки писмена информация и документи относно извършената здравна услуга или доставената здравна стока. Тази информация включва диагноза, предписано лечение, медицинска документация, лекарствени продукти, медицински изделия, консумативи и материали, вложени в лечението, вида и обхвата на услугата, както и действащия ценоразпис.\n\n\nПредоставяне на здравни услуги\nЗдравните услуги се предоставят от изпълнители на медицинска помощ. Видът, цените, условията и редът за извършване на тези услуги се определят с договори между изпълнителите на медицинска помощ и застрахователите."

    "text": "Част I Обща част\n\nГлава I Общи положения\nТози текст представлява част от Закон за лечебните заведения в Република България, като урежда устройството, дейността и контрола върху лечебните заведения. Лечебните заведения се определят като организационно обособени структури, в които се осъществяват диагностика, лечение, рехабилитация, профилактика, укрепване на здравето и други медицински дейности. Те могат да бъдат създавани от държавата, общините, физически и юридически лица, като всички лечебни заведения са равнопоставени независимо от собствеността им.\nЛечебните заведения могат да предоставят както извънболнична, така и болнична помощ. Освен това, те могат да извършват обучение на студенти и медицински специалисти, както и научна дейност. Някои специфични типове лечебни заведения, като центрове за спешна медицинска помощ, центрове за трансфузионна хематология и лечебни заведения за стационарна психиатрична помощ, се създават от държавата. Лечебните заведения също могат да предоставят социални услуги и интегрирани здравно-социални услуги при определени условия.\nДейността на лечебните заведения се осъществява при спазване на медицинските стандарти за качество на медицинската помощ, които се утвърждават с наредби на министъра на здравеопазването. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да прилагат технологии и системи за събиране и обмен на информация, както и да предоставят медико-статистическа информация. Контролът върху лечебните заведения се осъществява от Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”, която проверява спазването на медицинските стандарти, правата на пациентите и качеството на медицинската помощ.\nОт 2025 г. лечебните заведения и медицинските специалисти могат да извършват медицинска помощ от разстояние, при условие че се спазват медицинските стандарти и се гарантира сигурността на личните данни и здравната информация. Медицинската помощ от разстояние включва диагностични, лечебни, рехабилитационни и профилактични дейности, но не се допуска, ако липсата на присъствен контакт с пациента застрашава живота или здравето му.\nКонтролът върху лечебните заведения се осъществява и чрез планови и извънредни проверки, като Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор” има право да изисква документи, сведения и да дава задължителни предписания. Служителите на агенцията са длъжни да пазят поверителността на информацията, получена по време на проверките.\nФинансирането на дейността на Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор” се осъществява от бюджетни средства и приходи от собствена дейност, включително глоби и имуществени санкции. Тези средства се използват за осъществяване на контролните функции на агенцията."

Картата се изработва въз основа на областни здравни карти, които се създават от областни комисии, ръководени от областните управители. Тези комисии включват представители на регионалните здравни инспекции, здравноосигурителните каси, лекарските и зъболекарските съюзи, професионалистите по здравни грижи, както и представители на общините и организации за защита на правата на пациентите.\nОбластните здравни карти включват:\n\nДанни за демографската структура, заболеваемостта и хоспитализираната заболеваемост на населението.\nВид, брой, дейност и разпределение на лечебните заведения в областта.\nНеобходимия минимален брой лекари, лекари по дентална медицина и специалисти по здравни грижи.\nБрой на съществуващите легла за болнично лечение и осъществяваните медицински дейности.\nДанни за високотехнологичните методи за диагностика и лечение и наличната медицинска апаратура.\n\nОбластните комисии извършват анализ на съществуващите лечебни заведения и предлагат мерки за преструктуриране, създаване или закриване на лечебни заведения, както и за осигуряване на необходимите медицински специалисти и легла. Лечебните заведения за болнична помощ се финансират със средства от държавния бюджет или от бюджета на Националната здравноосигурителна каса само за дейности, които отговарят на изискванията на областните здравни карти.\nНационалната здравна карта се изработва от национална комисия, ръководена от министъра на здравеопазването. Тя включва:\n\nОбластните здравни карти.\nПотребностите от лекари и специалисти по здравни грижи за всички области.\nПотребностите от легла за болнично лечение и медицински дейности.\nКарта на съществуващите лечебни заведения и високотехнологичните методи за диагностика и лечение.\nАнализ на състоянието в областите и планиране на необходимите медицински дейности.\n\nНационалната здравна карта се утвърждава с решение на Министерския съвет и се актуализира при необходимост. Тя е задължителна за планирането на медицинските дейности в лечебните заведения, с изключение на някои специфични заведения, създадени от лекари по дентална медицина.\nВ областите, където броят на леглата за болнично лечение надвишава определените потребности, директорите на РЗОК сключват договори с лечебни заведения или техните обединения за оптимизиране на ресурсите.\n\n\nГлава VII Създаване регистрация и разрешение на лечебните заведения\n\nРаздел I Създаване на лечебните заведения\nГлава седма урежда процеса на създаване, регистрация и разрешение за функциониране на лечебните заведения. Лечебните заведения, като центрове за спешна медицинска помощ, центрове за трансфузионна хематология и други, се създават и преобразуват от Министерския съвет по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването. Те са юридически лица с бюджетна издръжка, а тяхната структура и дейност се определят с правилник, издаден от министъра на здравеопазването или Министерския съвет, в зависимост от ведомствената принадлежност на заведението.\nЛечебните заведения за извънболнична помощ се учредяват като търговски дружества или кооперации и се регистрират по определен ред. Те могат да бъдат създадени от държавата, общините или частни лица. В предмета на дейност на тези заведения задължително се вписва осъществяването на извънболнична помощ.\nТъканните банки се учредяват като дружества с ограничена отговорност или акционерни дружества и осъществяват дейност след получаване на разрешение. В предмета на дейност на тъканната банка задължително се вписва осъществяването на специфични дейности, свързани с органи, тъкани и клетки.\nЛечебните заведения за болнична помощ, като болници, домове за медико-социални грижи, центрове за психично здраве и други, се учредяват от държавата, общините или частни лица като търговски дружества или кооперации. Те осъществяват дейност след получаване на разрешение. В предмета на дейност на тези заведения задължително се вписва осъществяването на болнична помощ.\nСъздаването на лечебни заведения за болнична помощ и комплексни онкологични центрове изисква одобрение от Министерския съвет, базирано на комплексна оценка на потребностите на населението, кадровата и материалната обезпеченост, както и други фактори. За извършване на оценката се подава заявление до министъра на здравеопазването, към което се прилагат проект, бизнес план и други документи. Оценката се извършва от Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор”.\nИзвършването на нови медицински дейности от лечебни заведения за болнична помощ и комплексни онкологични центрове се разрешава със заповед на министъра на здравеопазването, след комплексна оценка на потребностите и възможностите за финансиране. Отказът за създаване на лечебно заведение или за извършване на нови медицински дейности може да бъде обжалван пред административен съд.\n\n\nРаздел II Регистрация\nЛечебните заведения за извънболнична помощ и хосписите подлежат на регистрация. Регистрацията включва и лечебната дейност, която може да включва до 10 легла за наблюдение и лечение до 48 часа. В случай на необходимост от по-дълъг престой, медицинските факултети или факултетите по дентална медицина трябва да организират хоспитализацията на пациента. Изискванията за устройството, дейността и вътрешния ред на лечебните заведения се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\nРегистрацията се извършва от изпълнителния директор на Изпълнителна агенция “Медицински надзор” на базата на заявление, към което се прилагат документи като актуална регистрация, правилник за устройството и дейността на заведението, данни за съдружниците или акционерите, дипломи за висше образование и документи за призната специалност на лицата, които ще работят в заведението.

Изискванията за устройството, дейността и вътрешния ред на тези заведения се определят с наредба на министъра на здравеопазването.\nЗа издаване на разрешение лечебните заведения подават заявление до министъра на здравеопазването, към което се прилагат документи като актуална регистрация, правилник за устройството и дейността на заведението, дипломи за висше образование на управляващите лица, данни за членовете на управителните и контролните органи, стандартни оперативни процедури (за тъканните банки) и документи за платена държавна такса. Заявлението се подава в регионалната здравна инспекция, която извършва проверка за спазване на изискванията на закона, медицинските стандарти и наличието на лицензия за използване на йонизиращи лъчения (ако е необходимо). При установени несъответствия се дават предписания за отстраняването им в срок до три месеца.\nИзпълнителната агенция “Медицински надзор” изпраща документите на министъра на здравеопазването, който в срок от 75 дни издава разрешение или мотивиран отказ. В разрешението се вписват данни като наименование на заведението, единен идентификационен код, дейности, които ще се осъществяват, ниво на компетентност, медицински специалности, клиники и отделения, както и адрес на дейността. Отказ може да бъде издаден при непълноти в документите, несъответствия със здравните изисквания или медицинските стандарти, или ако лицата, управляващи заведението, не са вписани в съответните регистри. Отказът може да бъде обжалван пред административен съд.\nВ Министерството на здравеопазването се води публичен регистър на лечебните заведения с разрешение за дейност. Регистърът включва данни като номер и дата на разрешението, име и адрес на заведението, ниво на компетентност, видове лечебни дейности и промени в обстоятелствата. Промени в разрешението се извършват по същия ред като издаването му, като се представят само документи, свързани с промяната.\nМинистърът на здравеопазването може да отнеме разрешението при установени нередности като извършване на дейности извън разрешените, нарушаване на здравните изисквания или медицинските стандарти, или при прекратяване на дейността за период над 3 месеца. Отнемането на разрешението се извършва с мотивирана заповед и може да бъде обжалвано пред административен съд, без да спира изпълнението на заповедта.\n\n\nРаздел IV Закриване на лечебните заведения\nЛечебните заведения се закриват с акт на Министерския съвет по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването, след съгласуване със съответния министър.

Членовете на комисията сключват договор със съответния министър, в който се уточняват техните права и задължения. След приключване на работата, комисията представя заключителен доклад и отчет.\nУсловията и редът за ликвидация на лечебните заведения се определят с наредба на Министерския съвет. Прекратяването и ликвидацията на лечебни заведения – търговски дружества или кооперации, се извършва по реда на Търговския закон или националното законодателство на държавата по регистрация (за чуждестранни дружества). При откриване на производство по несъстоятелност не се допуска запор върху парични средства като обезпечителна мярка. Прекратяването на лечебни заведения, създадени от общини, изисква съгласие на министъра на здравеопазването.\nС решението за прекратяване на лечебното заведение се назначава ликвидатор или ликвидатори, като се определя и тяхното възнаграждение. Ликвидатор може да бъде лице с висше образование в областта на медицината, денталната медицина, икономиката или правото, което не е лишено от правото да заема материалноотчетническа длъжност и не е било член на изпълнителен или контролен орган в дружество, прекратено поради несъстоятелност с неудовлетворени кредитори.\nЛиквидаторите са длъжни да уведомят обществеността за прекратяването на дейността чрез публикуване на съобщение в централен и местен всекидневник, както и да го поставят на обществени места и в лечебното заведение. Освен това, те трябва да уведомят районната здравноосигурителна каса и териториалната дирекция на Националната агенция за приходите в срок от 14 дни от назначаването си. Ликвидаторите създават условия за довършване на започнатата лечебна дейност, като се съобразяват с интересите на пациентите, и осигуряват предаването на медицинската документация на пациентите.\n\n\n\nГлава VIII Структура управление и персонал на лечебното заведение\n\nРаздел I Структура на лечебните заведения за болнична помощ\nЛечебните заведения за болнична помощ се състоят от клиники и/или отделения с легла, медико-диагностични и медико-технически лаборатории, отделения без легла, болнична аптека, консултативни кабинети, както и звена за административни, стопански и обслужващи дейности. Клиниките, отделенията и медико-диагностичните лаборатории имат определено ниво на компетентност, което се установява в съответствие с утвърдените медицински стандарти. Нивото на компетентност се определя по ред и критерии, определени в наредбата.\nКлиниката е болнично звено по определена медицинска или дентална специалност, ръководено от хабилитирано лице – лекар или лекар по дентална медицина. В клиниката се извършва диагностично-лечебна дейност и се провежда обучение на студенти, специализанти или продължителна квалификация. В клиниката могат да се откриват отделения, ако това е предвидено в правилника за устройството и дейността на заведението.\nОтделението е болнично звено по определена медицинска или дентална специалност, ръководено от лекар с призната специалност.

Стопанските и обслужващите дейности могат да се възлагат на външни лица чрез договори за поръчка или изработка.\nКъм държавните и общинските лечебни заведения за болнична помощ могат да се откриват и териториални експертни лекарски комисии, които са структурни звена на тези заведения.\n\n\nРаздел II Управление и контрол на лечебните заведения\nОрганите на управление и контрол на лечебните заведения се определят от тяхната юридическа форма. Министерският съвет, по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването, може да предостави на висше училище правата на едноличен собственик за управление на държавни лечебни заведения, които са университетски болници. С решение на Министерския съвет се одобрява и проект на договор, който урежда отношенията между министъра на здравеопазването и ректора на висшето училище. Този договор включва правата и задълженията на училището, финансовите ангажименти, изискванията за отчетност и прозрачност, гаранциите за добро управление и отговорността за финансовото състояние на заведението. Продажбата на обособени части от лечебните заведения и извършването на разпоредителни сделки с дълготрайни активи се извършват след решение на Министерския съвет.\nУправител или изпълнителен директор на лечебно заведение може да бъде лице с висше образование по медицина, дентална медицина, икономика или управление, придобило квалификация в областта на здравния мениджмънт. Държавните и общинските лечебни заведения имат едностепенна система на управление, като съветът на директорите се състои от трима члена. Членовете на управлението и контрола на държавните и общинските лечебни заведения се избират след провеждане на конкурс по Закона за публичните предприятия. Договорите за управление и контрол се сключват и прекратяват по реда на същия закон.\nДиректорът на лечебно заведение се назначава след конкурс и е отговорен за управлението на заведението, включително за финансовото му състояние и структурните промени. Той е работодател на всички служители в заведението. Директорите на определени типове лечебни заведения, като центрове за спешна медицинска помощ или домове за медико-социални грижи, се атестират ежегодно от комисия, назначена от министъра на здравеопазването.\nУправлението на медицинските дейности в лечебните заведения се осъществява от началници на клиники, отделения и лаборатории, които отговарят за медицинската дейност, икономическата ефективност и учебния процес. Главната медицинска сестра (акушерка, рехабилитатор) организира и контролира качеството на здравните грижи и хигиенното състояние на заведението.\nЛечебните заведения имат консултативни и контролни органи, като медицински съвет, лечебно-контролна комисия, комисия за борба с вътреболничните инфекции и съвет по здравни грижи. Тези органи консултират и контролират различни аспекти на дейността на заведението, включително ефективността на лечебния процес, профилактиката на инфекциите и качеството на сестринските грижи.\n\n\nРаздел III Персонал в лечебните заведения\nПерсоналът в лечебните заведения включва:\n\nЛекари, лекари по дентална медицина, фармацевти и други специалисти с висше образование, участващи в диагностично-лечебния процес. В университетските болници към този персонал се включват и лекари-преподаватели, които са специалисти в медицината, биологията, химията, физиката и други немедицински специалности.\nМедицински специалисти със степен “специалист” или “бакалавър” по здравни грижи.\nСпециализанти, които се обучават по реда на наредбата.\nДруги лица, изпълняващи административни и помощни дейности.\n\nЛекарите-преподаватели и лекарите по дентална медицина - преподаватели се назначават по реда на Закона за висшето образование, като конкурсът се обявява от висшето училище съгласувано с управителя на университетската болница. Лечебните заведения са длъжни да осигурят лекари с призната специалност на основен трудов договор, както и длъжности за специализанти.\nЧленовете на научно-преподавателския състав на клиниките и отделенията на университетските болници са част от катедрения съвет на съответните катедри на висшето училище. Учебната и научноизследователската дейност в тези болници се осъществява по планове и програми, приети от катедрите на медицинските факултети, съгласувано с управителя на лечебното заведение.\nЛекарите и лекарите по дентална медицина, които работят в лечебни заведения за болнична помощ, могат да регистрират индивидуална практика за извънболнична специализирана помощ, ако в същото населено място няма достатъчно специалисти. В такива случаи те могат да сключват договори с Националната здравноосигурителна каса. Преценката за недостатъчност на специалисти се извършва от директора на регионалната здравна инспекция, като се взема предвид Националната здравна карта. Лекарите, които регистрират индивидуална практика, трябва да работят минимум 5 часа седмично в лечебното заведение.\nРаботниците в лечебните заведения, за които е установено намалено работно време, могат да работят на смени с продължителност до 12 часа, независимо от намаленото работно време.\n\n\nРаздел IV Болнично настоятелство\nКъм лечебните заведения за болнична помощ могат да се учредяват болнични настоятелства. Те имат за цел да подпомагат болницата в нейната дейност, за да се задоволяват по-добре обществените потребности от медицински услуги.\nБолничното настоятелство се учредява от собствениците на лечебното заведение. Те отправят покана в медиите и канят лично общественици, дарители, представители на неправителствени организации и други заинтересовани лица. Тези лица избират членовете на настоятелството.\nНастоятелството се събира най-малко веднъж годишно по инициатива на една трета от членовете си, по искане на управителния орган на лечебното заведение или на собственика. На заседанията се кани управителният орган на заведението, който предоставя информация за състоянието му.\nБолничното настоятелство изпълнява следните функции:\n\nПодпомага изграждането и поддържането на съоръженията, оборудването и имотите на лечебното заведение.\nПредлага мерки за подобряване на дейността на заведението към собственика.\nПровежда акции и информационни кампании за мобилизиране на обществени сили и средства в подкрепа на лечебното заведение.\n\n\n\n\nГлава IX Акредитация\nОтменена в държавен вестник\n\n\nГлава X Участие на лечебните заведения в медицинското образование\nЛечебните заведения могат да провеждат дейности, свързани с медицинското образование, включително:\n\nКлинично обучение на студенти и докторанти по медицина, дентална медицина и фармация.\nКлинично обучение на студенти по специалности от професионално направление “Здравни грижи”.\nСледдипломно обучение за придобиване на медицинска специалност.\n\nТези дейности могат да се осъществяват само от лечебни заведения, които са получили одобрение от министъра на здравеопазването. Критериите и условията за одобрение, включително структурата, оборудването и квалификацията на персонала, се определят с наредба на министъра.\nМинистерският съвет, по предложение на министъра на здравеопазването, може да определи кои лечебни заведения или техните клиники/отделения придобиват правата на университетски болници/клиники за срок от 5 години. Това се извършва на базата на мотивирано искане от ректора на висшето училище, съгласувано с ръководителя на лечебното заведение. Правата могат да бъдат отнети преди изтичане на срока, ако заведението не отговаря на изискванията.\nОбучението в университетските болници/клиники включва и лечение на пациенти с заболявания, които са част от учебните програми на студенти и специализанти. Условията и редът за провеждане на обучението, както и неговото финансиране, се уреждат с договор между лечебното заведение и висшето училище. Средствата за обучение се осигуряват от държавния бюджет (частта за образование и наука или здравеопазване).\nЗа получаване на одобрение ръководителят на лечебното заведение подава заявление до министъра на здравеопазването, към което прилага обосновка за съответствието с критериите и документ за платена държавна такса. Проверката се извършва от експертна комисия, а резултатите се разглеждат от консултативен съвет, който дава становище за одобрение или отказ. Одобрението се издава със заповед и е валидно за 5 години.\nВ Министерството на здравеопазването се води публичен регистър на лечебните заведения, получили одобрение за участие в медицинското образование. В регистъра се вписват данни като номер и дата на заповедта, наименование на заведението, вид на обучението и специалностите, по които се провежда обучението. Условията и редът за водене на регистъра се определят с наредба.\n\n\nГлава XI Взаимодействие между лечебните заведения\nЛечебните заведения са длъжни да си взаимодействат при природни бедствия, епидемии и извънредни обстоятелства, като разходите им се възстановяват от държавата. Министърът на здравеопазването, главният държавен здравен инспектор и директорите на регионалните здравни инспекции имат правомощия да налагат мерки в лечебните заведения в такива ситуации. При извънредни епидемични обстоятелства министърът може да въвежда временни мерки, включително преструктуриране на лечебните заведения, определяне на специализирани заведения за лечение на заразни болести, промяна на броя легла и командироване на медицински специалисти. Тези мерки се прилагат със заповед на регионалните здравни инспекции и могат да включват изисквания към персонала и апаратурата. Лечебните заведения могат да извършват определени дейности без промяна в разрешителните им документи.\nЛечебните заведения имат право да сключват договори за предоставяне на медицински специалисти и услуги, както и да сътрудничат със застрахователи. Държавните и общинските лечебни заведения могат да лекуват пациенти срещу директно заплащане в ограничени рамки. Освен това, лечебните заведения могат да участват в системи за самооценка и рейтингови системи за оценка на качеството на медицинските и организационните дейности. Участието в такива системи е доброволно, а критериите и начинът на функциониране се определят от лечебните заведения и заинтересованите организации. Информация за оценките се публикува в интернет за информираност на пациентите и други заинтересовани страни.\n\n\nГлава XII Финансиране на лечебните заведения\nЛечебните заведения се финансират от различни източници, включително Националната здравноосигурителна каса, държавния и общинските бюджети, застрахователи, както и местни и чуждестранни юридически и физически лица. Приходите им се формират чрез договори за медицинска помощ, директни плащания, възстановяване на разходи, целеви субсидии, наеми на оборудване и помещения, дарения и други източници. В случаите, когато услугите не се предоставят по договор със здравната каса, лечебните заведения определят цените самостоятелно. Те са длъжни да предоставят ясна информация за цените на услугите и да издават финансови документи за всички плащания.\nРазходите за обучение на студенти, специализанти и научни изследвания не се включват в стойността на медицинските услуги и се договарят отделно. Държавата и общините могат да предоставят целеви субсидии за придобиване на дълготрайни активи, ремонти, информационни технологии, финансово оздравяване и други нужди. Финансирането на инвестиционни разходи може да се извършва чрез увеличаване на капитала на лечебните заведения, като държавата и общините записват нови дялове или акции. Неусвоените средства за капиталови разходи се връщат в бюджета.\nДиализните центрове се финансират от здравната каса на базата на договори, съобразно нейния бюджет. Лечебните заведения са задължени да спазват изискванията на Закона за държавните помощи при финансиране и увеличаване на капитала.\n\n\nГлава XIII Преобразуване и приватизация на лечебни заведения\n\nРаздел I Преобразуване на публичните здравни заведения\nГлава тринадесета регулира преобразуването и приватизацията на лечебните заведения. Публичните здравни заведения за болнична помощ, диспансери и болнични диагностично-лечебни структури към висшите училища се преобразуват в еднолични търговски дружества със заповед на министъра на здравеопазването. Собствеността върху капитала на преобразуваните заведения се придобива от държавата или общините, като държавата притежава 51% от капитала, а общините – 49%. Преобразуваните заведения са длъжни да получат разрешение за лечебна дейност, като до получаването му могат да продължат дейността си.\nПубличните здравни заведения за извънболнична помощ се преобразуват в еднолични търговски дружества, като медицинските специалисти могат да сключват наемни договори за помещения и оборудване. Имуществото на непреобразуваните заведения се управлява от общините. Преобразуването на санаторно-курортните и лечебно-оздравителните заведения също се извършва в еднолични търговски дружества с държавно имущество.\nС преобразуването на заведенията движимото и недвижимото имущество преминава в собственост на новосъздадените дружества, които са правоприемници на преобразуваните заведения. Трудовите правоотношения се уреждат по реда на Кодекса на труда. Разпоредителните сделки с дълготрайни материални активи и учредяването на вещни права изискват разрешение от собственика на капитала.\nДържавата и общините могат да финансират лечебни заведения за изпълнение на здравни програми и проекти, както и за поддържане на готовността им при извънредни ситуации. Министерството на здравеопазването субсидира преобразувани държавни и общински лечебни заведения за болнична помощ, както и центрове за психично здраве. Субсидиите се предоставят на базата на договори и в рамките на предвидените бюджетни средства."

    "section": "Classification by Purpose",
    "text": "Classification by Purpose\n\nBasic Research (Pure Research)\nBasic research is conducted to advance scientific knowledge and understanding without immediate practical application. This type of research focuses on testing theories and hypotheses, expanding the frontiers of knowledge, understanding fundamental principles, and exploring natural phenomena in their purest form.\nThe characteristics that define basic research include its being driven by curiosity and intellectual interest rather than practical concerns, its long-term orientation without expectations of immediate results, its potential lack of immediate practical applications, and its significant contributions to theoretical frameworks that may later inform applied work. For example, investigating the molecular mechanisms of cellular aging without specific therapeutic goals represents basic research, as the primary aim is to understand the fundamental processes rather than to develop immediate treatments.\n\n\nApplied Research\nApplied research seeks to solve specific, practical problems using scientific methods. It is characterized by its direct practical applications, problem-solving orientation, short to medium-term focus, and implementation-oriented outcomes that can be immediately put into practice.\nApplied research distinguishes itself through several key characteristics. It addresses real-world problems that have immediate relevance to practitioners and stakeholders, and it results in actionable solutions that can be implemented in practical settings. This type of research is often commissioned by organizations seeking to solve specific challenges, and it effectively bridges the gap between theory and practice by applying scientific principles to concrete problems. Examples of applied research include developing a new vaccine for a specific disease or improving agricultural yields through biotechnology, both of which have clear practical applications and immediate benefits.\n\n\nAction Research\nAction research combines research with action to solve immediate problems while contributing to knowledge. It involves a cyclical process of planning, action, observation, and reflection, operating through a participatory approach that involves stakeholders throughout the research process. This methodology enables simultaneous problem-solving and knowledge generation, with applications that are highly context-specific and tailored to particular situations. A typical example would be teachers researching and improving their own classroom practices through systematic inquiry, where the research directly informs and improves their daily teaching while also contributing to educational knowledge more broadly."

    "title": "Research Methodology: A Comprehensive Guide",
    "section": "Classification by Approach",
    "text": "Classification by Approach\n\nQuantitative Research\nQuantitative research employs numerical data and statistical methods to test hypotheses and measure variables. This approach is distinguished by several key features that shape its methodology and application. The data in quantitative research is objective and measurable, typically gathered from large sample sizes to ensure statistical power and generalizability. The analysis relies heavily on statistical techniques, and the reasoning process follows a deductive pattern, moving from general theories to specific predictions. Researchers utilize standardized instruments such as surveys and experiments to ensure consistency in data collection, and the findings from such research are designed to be generalizable to larger populations beyond the immediate study sample.\nThe methods employed in quantitative research include experiments where variables are manipulated under controlled conditions, surveys and questionnaires that gather structured data from respondents, structured observations that record behaviors systematically, and secondary data analysis that examines existing datasets. Each of these methods serves the overarching goal of quantifying phenomena and testing hypotheses through statistical analysis.\nQuantitative research offers several significant strengths. It provides high reliability and replicability, meaning that other researchers can repeat the study and obtain similar results. It enables researchers to test hypotheses formally using statistical procedures, and its findings can be generalized to larger populations with known levels of confidence. The objective measurement techniques reduce subjective bias and provide clear, numerical answers to research questions.\nHowever, quantitative research also has limitations that researchers must acknowledge. This approach may miss contextual nuances and subtle meanings that are important in understanding complex social phenomena. The research design offers limited flexibility during data collection, as procedures must be standardized and followed consistently. There is a risk of reducing complex phenomena to simple numbers, potentially losing important information in the translation. Finally, the focus on measurement and quantification can sometimes lead to oversimplification of intricate relationships and processes.\n\n\nQualitative Research\nQualitative research focuses on understanding meanings, experiences, and social phenomena through non-numerical data. This approach is characterized by rich, detailed descriptions that capture the complexity and nuance of human experience. Unlike quantitative research, qualitative studies typically employ small, purposive samples selected for their ability to provide deep insights rather than statistical representation. The reasoning process follows an inductive pattern, building theories from observed patterns in the data. Qualitative research designs are flexible and can be adapted as new insights emerge during the study. The researcher serves as the primary instrument for data collection and analysis, and the findings are understood to be context-dependent rather than universally generalizable.\nThe methods commonly used in qualitative research encompass in-depth interviews that explore participants’ perspectives and experiences, focus groups that examine group dynamics and collective meanings, participant observation where the researcher immerses themselves in the setting being studied, case studies that provide detailed examinations of specific instances, document analysis that examines written or visual materials, and ethnography that involves prolonged engagement with cultural groups to understand their ways of life.\nQualitative research offers distinct strengths that complement quantitative approaches. It provides deep understanding of complex phenomena that cannot be adequately captured through numbers alone. The flexibility and adaptability of qualitative methods allow researchers to follow unexpected lines of inquiry and capture emergent themes. This approach excels at capturing context and meaning, revealing how people make sense of their experiences and worlds. Researchers can explore unexpected findings that might be missed in more structured approaches.\nDespite these strengths, qualitative research faces certain limitations. The intensive nature of data collection and analysis makes it time-consuming compared to quantitative methods. The findings from small, purposive samples are difficult to generalize to broader populations. Potential researcher bias can influence data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Additionally, the context-specific and interpretive nature of qualitative research makes it challenging to replicate exactly, though researchers can achieve similar insights through parallel studies.\n\n\nMixed Methods Research\nMixed methods research combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of research problems. This integration can take several forms, each with its own logic and purpose. In a convergent design, both types of data are collected simultaneously, analyzed separately using appropriate methods for each, and then merged to compare and contrast the findings. An explanatory sequential design begins with quantitative data collection and analysis, followed by qualitative data that helps explain or elaborate on the quantitative findings. Conversely, an exploratory sequential design starts with qualitative data to explore a phenomenon, followed by quantitative testing of the patterns that emerged. Finally, an embedded design incorporates one type of data within a larger framework dominated by the other type, such as collecting qualitative data during a primarily quantitative experiment.\nThe advantages of mixed methods research are substantial and compelling. Triangulation, using multiple methods to study the same phenomenon, strengthens the validity of findings by providing multiple forms of evidence. This approach offers comprehensive understanding that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods could achieve alone. Mixed methods designs offset the weaknesses of single methods while capitalizing on their respective strengths. They are particularly well-suited to addressing complex research questions that have both numerical and experiential dimensions, allowing researchers to both measure phenomena and understand their meaning."

    "section": "Classification by Nature and Control",
    "text": "Classification by Nature and Control\n\nExperimental Research\nExperimental research involves manipulation of independent variables to determine their effect on dependent variables under controlled conditions. This approach can take several forms depending on the level of control and rigor applied. True experiments represent the gold standard of experimental research, featuring random assignment of participants to conditions, the use of control groups, and deliberate manipulation of the independent variable. Quasi-experiments maintain the manipulation and comparison group structure but lack random assignment, often due to practical or ethical constraints. Pre-experiments employ minimal control and are exploratory in nature, useful for preliminary investigations but limited in their ability to establish causation.\nThe key elements that define experimental research include the manipulation of independent variables by the researcher, the presence of control groups that provide a baseline for comparison, random assignment of participants to conditions in true experiments, a controlled environment that minimizes extraneous variables, and the ability to establish cause-and-effect relationships with greater confidence than non-experimental designs. For example, testing the effectiveness of a new teaching method by comparing student outcomes between experimental and control groups exemplifies experimental research, as it allows researchers to isolate the effect of the teaching method from other potential influences.\n\n\nNon-Experimental Research\nNon-experimental research observes and measures variables without manipulation. This broad category includes descriptive research, which describes characteristics of phenomena as they naturally occur, correlational research, which examines relationships between variables without manipulating them, and ex post facto research, which studies variables after events have occurred, looking back at potential causes of observed effects.\nThe characteristics that distinguish non-experimental research include the absence of variable manipulation by the researcher, the use of natural settings where phenomena occur organically, reliance on observation and measurement rather than intervention, and importantly, the inability to establish causation definitively. While non-experimental research can identify associations and patterns, it cannot rule out alternative explanations with the same confidence as experimental designs.\n\n\nField Research\nField research is conducted in natural, real-world settings rather than controlled laboratory environments. It is characterized by its use of natural environments where phenomena occur spontaneously, its emphasis on ecological validity through studying behaviors and processes in their authentic contexts, its focus on contextual understanding that recognizes the importance of setting and situation, and its common use of qualitative or mixed methods approaches. Examples of field research include anthropological studies of cultures in their native settings and market research conducted in actual retail environments where consumer behavior unfolds naturally.\n\n\nLaboratory Research\nLaboratory research is conducted in controlled, artificial settings where variables can be precisely manipulated. The advantages of this approach include high internal validity resulting from tight control over variables, precise control over experimental conditions, high replicability due to standardized procedures, and the ability to eliminate confounding variables that might obscure the relationships of interest. However, laboratory research also faces limitations, particularly in terms of limited ecological validity, since the artificial conditions may not reflect real-world complexity. The controlled setting may not generalize well to natural environments where multiple factors interact in ways that cannot be replicated in the laboratory."

    "text": "Classification by Time Dimension\n\nCross-Sectional Research\nCross-sectional research collects data at a single point in time from multiple subjects or cases. This approach provides a snapshot of phenomena, capturing the state of variables at one moment. It is quick and cost-effective compared to longitudinal designs, and it allows researchers to compare different groups simultaneously. However, cross-sectional research cannot establish temporal precedence, making it impossible to determine which variable came first in cases of correlation. For example, a survey measuring public opinion on a political issue at one time point represents cross-sectional research, providing valuable information about attitudes at that moment without tracking their evolution over time.\n\n\nLongitudinal Research\nLongitudinal research collects data from the same subjects repeatedly over an extended period. This approach takes several forms depending on the research question and practical constraints. Panel studies follow the same individuals throughout the research period, tracking changes at the individual level. Cohort studies examine a specific cohort, such as people born in the same year, as they age and develop. Trend studies sample different individuals from the same population at multiple time points, tracking population-level changes rather than individual trajectories.\nThe advantages of longitudinal research are substantial. It effectively tracks changes over time, revealing patterns of development, stability, and change. It establishes temporal precedence by showing which variables precede others, a crucial element in causal inference. Longitudinal designs identify developmental patterns across the lifespan or over extended periods, and they enable stronger causal inferences than cross-sectional designs by ruling out certain alternative explanations.\nDespite these strengths, longitudinal research faces significant challenges. It is time-consuming and expensive, requiring sustained commitment of resources over extended periods. Attrition of participants who drop out of the study can threaten validity and generalizability. Additionally, changing contexts and conditions over the study period can introduce confounds or make results difficult to interpret, as the social and environmental landscape may shift in ways that affect the phenomena being studied."

It must be clear and specific, precisely defining what is being investigated without ambiguity. The problem should be significant, addressing an important gap in knowledge that matters to the field or to practice. Feasibility is crucial, as the problem must be one that can be investigated with available resources, including time, funding, and access to participants or data. Ethical considerations are paramount, ensuring that the problem can be studied without ethical violations or harm to participants. Finally, the research problem should be novel, contributing new insights or knowledge rather than simply replicating what is already well-established.\n\n\nResearch Questions\nResearch questions operationalize the research problem into specific, answerable queries that guide the investigation. Effective research questions must meet several criteria to fulfill their function. They should be focused and specific, avoiding vagueness or excessive breadth. The questions must be answerable through empirical investigation, meaning that data can be collected to address them. They should align with research objectives, maintaining coherence throughout the study design. The scope should be neither too broad, which would make the study unmanageable, nor too narrow, which would limit its significance. Finally, research questions should be theoretically grounded, connecting to existing literature and conceptual frameworks rather than existing in isolation."

The primary purpose of conducting a literature review is to identify gaps in existing knowledge that the current study can address. It establishes the theoretical framework within which the research operates, demonstrating how the study connects to broader scholarly conversations. By reviewing previous research, investigators can avoid unnecessary duplication of research that has already been conducted adequately. The literature review also allows researchers to learn from previous methodologies, understanding what approaches have been successful and what challenges others have encountered. It contextualizes the current study within the broader field and supports the development of hypotheses by revealing patterns and relationships that previous research has identified.\nThe process of conducting a literature review follows a systematic approach. Researchers begin by defining the scope and boundaries of their review, determining which topics, time periods, and types of sources are relevant. They then search relevant databases and sources using appropriate keywords and search strategies. The evaluation and selection of appropriate sources requires critical assessment of quality, relevance, and credibility. Once sources are gathered, researchers synthesize the findings, identifying patterns, agreements, and contradictions across studies. This synthesis helps identify research gaps that justify the current study and builds the theoretical framework that will guide the investigation."

    "text": "Theoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework provides the conceptual foundation for the research, establishing the lens through which phenomena will be viewed and interpreted. This framework comprises several essential components. It includes key concepts and their definitions, ensuring clarity about the constructs being studied. It specifies relationships between variables, proposing how different elements connect and influence one another. The framework articulates underlying assumptions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and the phenomena under investigation. It presents theoretical models or paradigms from established schools of thought that inform the research approach. Finally, it provides guiding principles for interpretation, helping researchers make sense of their findings within a coherent conceptual system.\nThe functions of a theoretical framework are manifold and crucial to the research process. It guides research design by suggesting what variables to study, how to measure them, and what relationships to examine. The framework informs hypothesis formulation, as hypotheses derive from theoretical propositions about how variables relate. It provides a lens for data interpretation, helping researchers understand what their findings mean in relation to broader theoretical understanding. Perhaps most importantly, the theoretical framework connects the individual study to broader knowledge, showing how the research contributes to and extends existing theoretical understanding."

    "text": "Hypotheses and Research Objectives\n\nHypotheses\nHypotheses are testable predictions about relationships between variables, forming a bridge between theory and empirical investigation. Several types of hypotheses serve different purposes in research. The null hypothesis, denoted as H₀, states that no relationship or difference exists between variables, serving as the default position that statistical tests attempt to reject. The alternative hypothesis, denoted as H₁, asserts that a relationship or difference does exist. Hypotheses can be further classified as directional, specifying the direction of the relationship or difference, or non-directional, simply stating that a relationship exists without specifying its direction.\n\n\nResearch Objectives\nResearch objectives specify what the study aims to achieve, translating the broad research problem into concrete goals. Good research objectives possess several defining characteristics. They must be specific and measurable, allowing for clear assessment of whether they have been achieved. They should be achievable and realistic given the available resources and constraints. Relevance to the research problem ensures that objectives address the core questions of the study. Time-bound objectives include consideration of the timeframe for completion. Finally, effective objectives are written using action verbs such as determine, compare, evaluate, analyze, or assess, making clear what actions the research will undertake."

It specifies the collection methods and instruments that will be used, such as surveys, interviews, or observations. Detailed data collection procedures ensure consistency and reliability, and the timeline establishes when different data collection activities will occur.\nAnalysis design determines the statistical or analytical techniques appropriate for answering the research questions, the software and tools that will be used for data management and analysis, and the interpretation frameworks that will guide sense-making of the results."

    "section": "Variables and Operationalization",
    "text": "Variables and Operationalization\n\nTypes of Variables\nUnderstanding the different types of variables is essential for research design and analysis. The independent variable is the variable that is manipulated by the researcher or serves as the predictor in the study. The dependent variable represents the outcome or response that is measured. Control variables are those that are held constant to isolate the effects of the independent variable. Moderating variables affect the strength of the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Mediating variables explain the mechanism or process through which the independent variable affects the dependent variable. Finally, confounding variables are extraneous factors that may affect results and need to be accounted for or controlled.\n\n\nOperationalization\nOperationalization defines how abstract concepts will be measured in concrete, observable terms, translating theoretical constructs into measurable variables. The operationalization process follows several steps. Researchers begin with a conceptual definition that clearly articulates the theoretical meaning of the construct. They then identify dimensions of the concept, recognizing that complex constructs often have multiple facets. For each dimension, they determine specific indicators that can be observed or measured. The specification of measurement procedures details exactly how data will be collected to assess each indicator. Finally, researchers establish validity and reliability to ensure that the operationalization accurately captures the intended construct and does so consistently."

    "section": "Data Collection Methods",
    "text": "Data Collection Methods\n\nPrimary Data Collection\nPrimary data collection involves gathering new data directly from sources for the specific purpose of the current research. Surveys and questionnaires represent one of the most common methods, which can be self-administered by participants or administered by researchers. These instruments may be structured with fixed response options, semi-structured with a mix of fixed and open-ended questions, or unstructured to allow maximum flexibility. The mode of administration can vary, including online platforms, telephone calls, mail correspondence, or in-person meetings.\nInterviews provide another crucial method of primary data collection, offering deeper insights than surveys typically allow. Like surveys, interviews can be structured with predetermined questions, semi-structured with a flexible guide, or unstructured to follow the natural flow of conversation. They may be conducted with individuals or with groups in focus group settings. The format can include face-to-face meetings, telephone conversations, or video conferencing.\nObservation allows researchers to collect data about behaviors, interactions, and phenomena as they naturally occur. The researcher may engage in participant observation, becoming involved in the setting, or non-participant observation, remaining separate from the activities being studied. Observations can be structured using predetermined categories and protocols or unstructured to capture whatever emerges. The setting may be natural, where phenomena occur spontaneously, or laboratory, where conditions are controlled.\nExperiments involve the systematic manipulation of variables under controlled conditions. These may take place in laboratory settings with maximum control or in field settings that maintain greater ecological validity. The hallmark of experimental data collection is controlled manipulation of the independent variable and careful measurement of outcomes.\n\n\nSecondary Data Collection\nSecondary data collection involves using data that already exist, gathered for purposes other than the current research. Sources of secondary data include published literature and reports, archival records maintained by organizations or institutions, databases and datasets compiled by researchers or agencies, official statistics collected by government bodies, and historical documents that provide information about past events and contexts."

    "section": "Data Analysis Methods",
    "text": "Data Analysis Methods\n\nQuantitative Analysis\nQuantitative analysis employs statistical techniques to examine numerical data and test hypotheses. Descriptive statistics provide initial summaries of data characteristics. Measures of central tendency, including the mean, median, and mode, indicate typical values in the distribution. Measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation, variance, and range, describe the spread of data. Frequency distributions show how often different values occur, while graphical representations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots provide visual summaries of patterns and relationships.\nInferential statistics allow researchers to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data and to test hypotheses about relationships and differences. Hypothesis testing procedures, including t-tests for comparing means, ANOVA for comparing multiple groups, and chi-square tests for examining relationships between categorical variables, form the foundation of inferential analysis. Correlation analysis examines the strength and direction of relationships between variables. Regression analysis allows prediction of one variable from others and assessment of the unique contribution of each predictor. Multivariate analysis techniques handle multiple variables simultaneously, revealing complex patterns and relationships that simpler analyses might miss.\n\n\nQualitative Analysis\nQualitative analysis focuses on identifying patterns, themes, and meanings in non-numerical data through systematic examination and interpretation. Various approaches guide this process. Thematic analysis identifies, analyzes, and reports themes within data. Content analysis systematically examines the presence, meanings, and relationships of concepts within texts. Grounded theory builds theoretical understanding from the ground up through systematic analysis of data. Discourse analysis examines how language constructs social reality. Narrative analysis focuses on how people make sense of experiences through storytelling.\nThe qualitative analysis process typically follows several steps. Researchers begin with data familiarization, reading and re-reading the data to gain deep familiarity. Coding and categorization involve identifying meaningful segments of data and organizing them into categories. Theme identification recognizes broader patterns across categories. Interpretation and synthesis bring the analysis together, making sense of patterns in relation to research questions and existing literature. For some approaches, particularly grounded theory, the process culminates in theory building that generates new conceptual understanding from the data."

    "section": "Validity and Reliability",
    "text": "Validity and Reliability\n\nValidity\nValidity refers to the extent to which a study measures what it intends to measure, ensuring that conclusions drawn from the research are accurate and meaningful. Several types of validity address different aspects of research quality. Internal validity concerns the confidence researchers can have in cause-effect relationships, asking whether changes in the dependent variable can truly be attributed to manipulation of the independent variable. External validity addresses the generalizability of findings, questioning whether results apply beyond the specific sample and setting studied. Construct validity examines whether measures accurately capture the theoretical concepts they are intended to represent. Content validity assesses whether a measure comprehensively covers the domain of the construct being measured. Criterion validity evaluates how well a measure correlates with relevant outcomes or other established measures of the same construct.\n\n\nReliability\nReliability refers to the consistency and stability of measurements, ensuring that research instruments produce dependable results. Different forms of reliability address various aspects of consistency. Test-retest reliability examines consistency over time by administering the same measure to the same participants on different occasions. Inter-rater reliability assesses consistency across observers or raters, important when subjective judgment is involved in measurement or coding. Internal consistency evaluates coherence among test items, determining whether items intended to measure the same construct produce similar results. Parallel forms reliability examines consistency across equivalent versions of a measure, useful when multiple versions are needed to prevent practice effects.\n\n\nStrategies to Enhance Validity and Reliability\nResearchers employ various strategies to strengthen the validity and reliability of their studies. Using validated instruments that have been tested and refined in previous research provides a strong foundation. Pilot testing allows identification and correction of problems before full-scale data collection. Triangulation of methods or sources provides multiple forms of evidence, strengthening confidence in findings. Clear operational definitions ensure that all involved understand exactly what is being measured. Standardized procedures reduce variability introduced by inconsistent administration. Training of data collectors ensures they understand and follow protocols correctly. Peer review and expert consultation provide external perspectives that can identify potential weaknesses or biases that researchers might miss."

    "text": "Ethical Considerations\nResearch ethics ensure the rights, safety, and dignity of research participants, maintaining the integrity of the scientific enterprise.\n\nCore Ethical Principles\nThe principle of respect for persons encompasses several key obligations. Informed consent requires that participants understand what the research involves and voluntarily agree to participate. The right to withdraw ensures that participants can discontinue their involvement at any time without penalty. Protection of privacy and confidentiality safeguards participants’ personal information from unauthorized disclosure. Special protection for vulnerable populations recognizes that some groups, such as children, prisoners, or individuals with cognitive impairments, require additional safeguards.\nThe principle of beneficence obligates researchers to maximize benefits while minimizing risks and harm to participants. This involves careful risk-benefit assessment to ensure that potential benefits justify any risks involved. Researchers must actively work to maximize the potential benefits of their research, whether these are benefits to individual participants, to the communities they represent, or to society more broadly through the advancement of knowledge.\nThe principle of justice demands fair distribution of research benefits and burdens across society. Equitable selection of participants ensures that no group bears a disproportionate burden of research risks or is systematically excluded from potential benefits. Access to research findings should be available to those who participated and to communities that might benefit from the knowledge generated.\n\n\nEthical Review Process\nThe ethical review process typically involves several components. Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee approval is generally required before research begins, with these bodies reviewing proposed studies to ensure ethical standards are met. Informed consent procedures must be clearly articulated, showing how participants will be informed and how their consent will be documented. Data protection and confidentiality measures detail how participant information will be kept secure. Conflict of interest disclosure reveals any financial or personal interests that might bias the research. Honest reporting of results commits researchers to presenting findings accurately and completely, even when results are unexpected or unfavorable."

Research Questions and Hypotheses\n\n5.1 Main Research Question(s)\nState the primary question(s) the research will address.\nExample: “How does social media usage affect academic performance among undergraduate students?”\n\n\n5.2 Sub-Questions\nBreak down the main question into specific, answerable components.\nExample: The sub-questions might explore what is the extent of social media usage among undergraduate students, examining both frequency and duration of use. They would also investigate what is the relationship between time spent on social media and GPA, looking for correlations between usage patterns and academic outcomes. Additionally, the research would ask how different types of social media use affect different aspects of academic performance, recognizing that not all social media engagement may have the same impact.\n\n\n5.3 Hypotheses\nState testable predictions (for quantitative research).\nExample: The alternative hypothesis posits that there is a significant negative relationship between hours spent on social media and GPA, suggesting that increased social media use is associated with lower academic performance. The corresponding null hypothesis states that there is no significant relationship between hours spent on social media and GPA, serving as the default position that statistical tests will attempt to reject.\n\n\n\n\n6. Research Objectives\n\n6.1 General Objective\nOverall aim of the research.\nExample: “To investigate the impact of social media usage on academic performance among undergraduate students at [University Name].”\n\n\n6.2 Specific Objectives\nConcrete, measurable objectives.\nExample:\nThe specific objectives of the study are to measure the extent and patterns of social media usage among undergraduate students, documenting how much time they spend on various platforms and for what purposes. The research aims to assess the academic performance of participants through validated measures. A central objective is to determine the correlation between social media usage and academic performance, testing whether relationships exist and in what direction. The study seeks to identify moderating factors affecting this relationship, such as self-regulation skills or study environment characteristics. Finally, the research aims to develop recommendations for optimal social media use patterns that might help students maintain academic performance while benefiting from social media engagement.\n\n\n\n\n7. Research Methodology\n\n7.1 Research Design\n\nType of research (descriptive, correlational, experimental, etc.)\nApproach (quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods)\nJustification for chosen design\n\nExample: “This study will employ a quantitative, correlational research design using a cross-sectional survey approach. This design is appropriate because it allows examination of relationships between variables at a single point in time.”\n\n\n7.2 Population and Sampling\nTarget Population:\nDefine the population to which findings will be generalized.\nExample: “All undergraduate students enrolled at [University Name] during the 2024-2025 academic year (N = 15,000).”\nSampling Method:\n\nSampling technique (random, stratified, convenience, purposive, etc.)\nSample size calculation and justification\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nExample: “Stratified random sampling will be used to ensure representation across all academic years and colleges. Using Cochran’s formula with 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error, the required sample size is 375 students.”\nSampling Frame:\nSource from which sample will be drawn.\n\n\n7.3 Data Collection\nInstruments:\nDescribe tools for data collection.\nExample for Quantitative Study:\nThe study would employ three primary instruments for data collection. The Social Media Usage Questionnaire (SMUQ), adapted from previous research, measures frequency, duration, and purpose of social media use through 20 items on a 5-point Likert scale. This instrument has demonstrated good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85. Academic performance would be measured through self-reported GPA, which would then be verified through official records with participant consent to ensure accuracy. Finally, a demographics questionnaire would collect basic information including age, gender, major, and year of study to enable subgroup analyses and control for potentially confounding variables.\nProcedures:\nThe step-by-step data collection process would begin with obtaining ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board, ensuring all procedures meet ethical standards. Following approval, a pilot test would be conducted with 30 participants to identify any problems with the instruments or procedures. Based on the pilot results, instruments would be revised as needed to improve clarity and reliability. The main data collection would then proceed by distributing an online survey via university email to all eligible participants. To maximize response rates, follow-up reminders would be sent after one week and again after two weeks. The survey would close after three weeks of availability. For participants who consent to verification, GPA data would be obtained from the registrar’s office. Finally, all collected data would be coded, cleaned to identify and address any errors or inconsistencies, and prepared for analysis.\n\n\n7.4 Variables\nIndependent Variable(s):\nThe independent variables in this study include social media usage measured in hours per day, the types of social media platforms used by participants, and the purpose of social media use, whether for academic, social, entertainment, or other purposes.\nDependent Variable(s):\nThe dependent variables are academic performance, primarily measured by GPA, and study habits, which may be affected by social media engagement patterns.\nControl Variables:\nThe study controls for several demographic and background variables including age, gender, socioeconomic status, and prior academic achievement, all of which might independently affect academic performance.\nModerating Variables:\nSelf-regulation skills and study environment characteristics are examined as potential moderators that might strengthen or weaken the relationship between social media use and academic outcomes.\n\n\n7.5 Data Analysis\nQuantitative Analysis Plan:\nThe data analysis would proceed in several stages. Descriptive statistics would begin the analysis, calculating frequency distributions to understand the characteristics of the sample, means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and creating a comprehensive demographics table. Inferential statistics would then test the research hypotheses. The Pearson correlation coefficient would examine the relationship between usage and GPA. Multiple regression analysis would build a predictive model that accounts for multiple variables simultaneously. ANOVA would test for differences across groups, such as students in different majors or class years. Throughout the analysis, a significance level of α = 0.05 would be used to determine statistical significance. The software employed for these analyses would be either SPSS version 28 or R version 4.x, both of which provide robust capabilities for the planned analyses.\nFor Qualitative Studies:\nQualitative studies would instead employ a coding framework appropriate to the research questions and theoretical orientation. The analysis approach might include thematic analysis, grounded theory, or another qualitative methodology. Quality criteria would emphasize credibility through prolonged engagement and member checking, transferability through thick description, and dependability through careful documentation of the research process.\n\n\n\n\n8. Validity and Reliability Measures\n\n8.1 Validity\nMultiple approaches would be used to establish validity. Content validity would be established through expert review of instruments by faculty members with relevant expertise. Construct validity would be assessed through factor analysis to ensure that items cluster as theoretically expected. External validity would be enhanced through random sampling, which increases confidence that findings can be generalized to the broader student population.\n\n\n8.2 Reliability\nReliability would be established through several means. Internal consistency would be assessed using Cronbach’s alpha for all multi-item scales, with values above 0.70 considered acceptable. Test-retest reliability would be examined by administering the survey to a subset of pilot participants and then re-administering it after two weeks to assess stability over time.\n\n\n8.3 Minimizing Bias\nSeveral strategies would minimize bias in the study. Standardized data collection procedures would ensure consistency across all participants. Triangulation using multiple data sources, such as self-reported GPA and official records, would provide converging evidence. Throughout the research process, reflexivity and transparency would be maintained, with the researcher documenting decisions and considering how their own perspectives might influence the research.\n\n\n\n\n9. Ethical Considerations\n\n9.1 Ethical Approval\nAn application would be submitted to the Institutional Review Board for review and approval, with an expected approval date prior to beginning any data collection activities.\n\n\n9.2 Informed Consent\nWritten informed consent forms would be provided to all participants, offering clear explanation of the study’s purpose, the procedures involved, any potential risks or benefits, and emphasizing the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or negative consequences.\n\n\n9.3 Confidentiality and Privacy\nParticipant responses would be kept confidential through the use of anonymous or coded identifiers rather than names. All data would be stored securely in encrypted, password-protected files accessible only to the research team. Access to identifiable data would be strictly limited to essential research personnel. A clear data retention and destruction policy would specify how long data would be kept and when identifiable information would be destroyed.\n\n\n9.4 Risk-Benefit Analysis\nThe study poses minimal risk to participants, involving only completion of a survey about their social media use and academic performance. The benefits include contributing to scientific knowledge about social media and education, with potential for developing interventions that could help students succeed academically. No monetary compensation would be offered to participants to avoid any sense of coercion to participate.\n\n\n\n\n10.

Limitations and Delimitations\n\n12.1 Limitations\nPotential constraints beyond the researcher’s control must be acknowledged. The reliance on self-reported data introduces the possibility of recall bias, as participants may not accurately remember or report their social media usage. The cross-sectional design, while efficient, cannot establish causality with certainty since all variables are measured at the same point in time. The sample, being limited to one university, may not fully represent all undergraduate students nationally or internationally, potentially limiting generalizability. Additionally, responses may be influenced by social desirability bias, with participants potentially under-reporting behaviors they perceive as negative or over-reporting behaviors they view as positive.\n\n\n12.2 Delimitations\nBoundaries have been deliberately set by the researcher to make the study manageable and focused. The study focuses only on undergraduate students, excluding graduate students who may have different patterns of social media use and different academic demands. The investigation is limited to one academic year, providing a snapshot rather than tracking changes over extended periods. Finally, the research examines only academic performance as an outcome, not investigating other potentially important life outcomes such as mental health, social relationships, or career preparation.\n\n\n\n\n13. Expected Outcomes and Deliverables\n\n13.1 Expected Findings\nWhile remaining open to unexpected findings that may emerge from the data, the research anticipates several potential outcomes. The study expects to identify distinct usage patterns among undergraduate students, revealing how different groups engage with social media. It aims to quantify the relationship between social media use and academic performance, determining whether and to what extent usage affects grades. The research also seeks to develop a profile of at-risk students who may be particularly vulnerable to negative effects of excessive social media use, potentially informing targeted interventions.\n\n\n13.2 Deliverables\nThe research will produce several concrete outputs. The primary deliverable will be a final research report in the form of a thesis or dissertation that comprehensively presents the study and its findings. At least one journal article will be prepared for submission to peer-reviewed publications, with Educational Psychology Review identified as a target journal. The results will be presented at academic conferences, with the American Educational Research Association conference as a target venue. A policy brief or recommendations document will translate findings into actionable guidance for university administrators and student services. Finally, an anonymized dataset will be prepared for potential secondary analysis by other researchers, contributing to the broader research community.\n\n\n\n\n14. Dissemination Plan\n\n14.1 Academic Dissemination\nThe research findings will be shared with the academic community through multiple channels. Manuscripts will be prepared and submitted to peer-reviewed journals, with Educational Psychology Review identified as a particularly appropriate target due to its focus on educational research with practical implications. The results will also be presented at academic conferences, with the American Educational Research Association annual meeting representing a key venue for reaching education researchers and practitioners.\n\n\n14.2 Practical Dissemination\nBeyond academic audiences, the research will be communicated to practical stakeholders who can apply the findings. A comprehensive report will be prepared for university administration, highlighting implications for student support and campus policies. A workshop will be offered for student services staff, helping them understand the findings and integrate them into their advising and support work. To reach a broader public audience, a blog post or media release will present the findings in accessible language, potentially raising awareness among students, parents, and educators beyond the research community.\n\n\n\n\n15.

    "text": "Pharmaceutical Advances and Regulatory Actions\nThe European Medicines Agency concluded its October 2025 meeting with several significant regulatory decisions that will impact clinical practice across Europe and potentially influence global therapeutic approaches to chronic diseases. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended approval for two novel therapeutic agents addressing previously inadequately treated conditions, while declining authorization for one product under consideration for chronic graft-versus-host disease.\nBrinsupri, containing the active substance brensocatib, received a positive opinion as the first authorized treatment specifically for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. This chronic pulmonary condition affects thousands of patients across Europe and is characterized by permanent dilation and damage to the bronchial airways, resulting from recurrent infections, inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance. Patients with bronchiectasis experience chronic productive cough, recurrent pulmonary infections, progressive decline in lung function, and significantly impaired quality of life. The disease typically follows a progressive course with alternating periods of clinical stability and acute exacerbations requiring antimicrobial therapy and sometimes hospitalization. Brensocatib represents a mechanism-based approach targeting neutrophil serine proteases, which play a central role in the inflammatory cascade driving bronchiectasis progression. The availability of this treatment addresses a significant unmet medical need, as previous management strategies relied primarily on symptomatic treatment with bronchodilators, mucolytics, and antibiotics without disease-modifying therapies.\nWayrilz, with the active substance rilzabrutinib, received positive recommendation for treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in adult patients who have proven refractory to other therapeutic interventions. Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated platelet destruction and inadequate platelet production, resulting in thrombocytopenia that places patients at risk for spontaneous bleeding, including potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The condition significantly impacts patients’ daily activities, as those with severe thrombocytopenia must restrict physical activity to avoid trauma and may experience fatigue, petechiae, purpura, and mucosal bleeding. Rilzabrutinib functions as a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting B-cell and macrophage function involved in antiplatelet antibody production and platelet destruction. For patients who have failed conventional therapies including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and splenectomy, this novel mechanism provides an important therapeutic alternative.\nThe Committee declined to recommend authorization for Rezurock, containing belumosudil, for treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. This decision reflects the rigorous evaluation process employed by European regulatory authorities to ensure that benefits clearly outweigh risks before medications receive marketing authorization. Chronic graft-versus-host disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the decision underscores the continuing need for effective therapies for this condition.\nBeyond these specific approvals, the EMA Committee issued positive opinions for extensions of therapeutic indications for eight existing medicines, expanding the clinical scenarios in which these established treatments may be employed. These indication extensions typically reflect accumulated clinical experience, completed clinical trials demonstrating efficacy in new patient populations, or recognition of therapeutic utility in related conditions."

    "text": "West Nile Virus: Continental Perspective and Transmission Dynamics\nAs of October 3, 2025, the European surveillance network has recorded 989 confirmed WNV cases across 13 member countries, marking a significant year for West Nile virus activity in the region. Italy leads with 714 cases and 48 fatalities, representing the most substantial outbreak in Europe. The primary affected regions include Lazio and Campania, where ecological conditions favor sustained mosquito breeding and bird populations that maintain the viral reservoir. The case fatality rate highlights the severity of infections in vulnerable populations, particularly elderly individuals and those with underlying immunosuppressive conditions. Greece, Serbia, and other Balkan nations continue to report active transmission, with the temporal pattern showing that cases began on June 2, 2025, peaked around late September, and continue under active monitoring into November.\nThe geographic distribution demonstrates the persistent establishment of WNV transmission cycles across Southern and Southeastern Europe, with mosquito vectors maintaining activity later into the season than historical averages. This extended transmission season likely reflects warmer autumn temperatures that prolong mosquito survival and activity, along with changes in precipitation patterns that create more persistent breeding sites. West Nile virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes, particularly Culex pipiens in Europe. These mosquitoes typically feed during evening and nighttime hours, with peak biting activity occurring at dusk and dawn. The virus cannot be transmitted person-to-person through casual contact, though rare cases of transmission through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and from mother to fetus during pregnancy have been documented.\nThe majority of WNV infections, approximately 80 percent, remain asymptomatic. About 20 percent of infected individuals develop West Nile fever, characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, body aches, joint pain, and sometimes rash. Less than 1 percent of infections progress to severe neuroinvasive disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. The risk of severe disease increases dramatically with age, particularly in individuals over 60 years, and in those with compromised immune systems due to chronic disease, immunosuppressive medications, or organ transplantation."

    "text": "Chikungunya Virus: Epidemiology and Emerging European Transmission\nAutochthonous chikungunya transmission represents a growing public health concern in Southern Europe, marking a significant shift in the epidemiology of this arboviral disease. France has reported 768 total cases with 13 new cases documented in week 44, showing clustered transmission patterns that indicate localized outbreaks with ongoing risk for continued transmission. Italy has accumulated 370 total cases with one new case in the most recent reporting period, with geographic clustering suggesting focused transmission zones where enhanced entomological surveillance remains active.\nThe sustained transmission of chikungunya, a disease traditionally associated with tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean islands, signals the expanding range of competent vectors and the adaptation of arboviral transmission to European climates. The primary vector responsible for European transmission is Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. This highly adaptable mosquito species has successfully colonized much of Southern Europe over the past two decades, taking advantage of international trade and travel to establish populations far from its native Southeast Asian range. Unlike Culex mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus, Aedes albopictus is a daytime feeder, with peak biting activity occurring during early morning and late afternoon hours.\nChikungunya virus is transmitted directly from human to mosquito to human, without requiring a bird or animal reservoir. When a mosquito bites an infected person during the viremic phase of illness, typically during the first week of symptoms, it can acquire the virus and subsequently transmit it to other people. This direct human-to-human transmission cycle through mosquito vectors allows for rapid amplification of cases in areas with high densities of competent mosquitoes and susceptible human populations. The disease presents with sudden onset of high fever and severe joint pain, often so debilitating that patients have difficulty walking. The name “chikungunya” derives from a Kimakonde word meaning “to become contorted,” referring to the stooped posture of patients suffering from severe arthralgia. While rarely fatal, the joint pain can persist for months or even years in some patients, causing significant morbidity and reduced quality of life.\nThe establishment of autochthonous transmission in France and Italy represents a sentinel event in European infectious disease epidemiology. Previously, chikungunya cases in Europe were exclusively travel-associated, with patients having acquired infection during visits to endemic areas. The documentation of local transmission indicates that all three necessary components for sustained arboviral disease have aligned: competent vector populations, suitable climatic conditions for viral replication and transmission, and sufficient numbers of susceptible hosts. This epidemiological transition has important implications for public health preparedness and vector control strategies across the continent."

    "text": "Other Infectious Disease Activity in Europe\nMpox surveillance continues across Balkan countries, with Serbia reporting 40 confirmed cases, leading regional totals. Sporadic cases in neighboring countries demonstrate ongoing transmission, though at lower levels than observed during the peak of the 2022-2023 international outbreak. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is caused by the monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus related to the virus that causes smallpox. Unlike the arboviral diseases discussed above, mpox transmits through close contact with infected individuals, including direct contact with skin lesions, respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact, and potentially through contaminated materials such as bedding or clothing.\nThe current outbreak in Europe is predominantly caused by clade IIb of the virus and is primarily affecting networks of men who have sex with men, though transmission can occur in any setting involving close physical contact. The disease typically presents with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion, followed by the development of a characteristic rash that progresses through stages from macules to papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally scabs. Enhanced contact tracing and isolation protocols remain critical for containing transmission chains, along with targeted vaccination campaigns using modified vaccinia Ankara vaccines for high-risk populations and post-exposure prophylaxis.\nRespiratory virus activity continues under routine seasonal monitoring, with early indicators of the autumn and winter respiratory season beginning to emerge. Surveillance systems remain prepared for potential co-circulation of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which could place strain on healthcare systems if multiple respiratory pathogens circulate simultaneously at high levels. The integration of molecular diagnostics and syndromic surveillance provides early warning of shifts in respiratory disease epidemiology."

    "section": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends",
    "text": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends\n\nVector-Borne Diseases in Bulgaria\nBulgaria’s position within the endemic Balkan region places it at ongoing risk for vector-borne diseases, particularly West Nile virus. During 2025, the country has documented one confirmed case of West Nile fever, representing a dramatic decline from the 28 cases reported during the same period in 2024. This substantial year-over-year reduction of 27 cases may reflect several factors, including variations in mosquito population density influenced by climatic conditions, changes in migratory bird patterns affecting viral introduction and amplification, or potentially more effective vector control measures implemented following previous seasons of high transmission.\nThe presence of WNV in Bulgaria reflects the country’s geographical position within the endemic zone that extends across the Balkans and Mediterranean basin. The Danube River basin and wetland areas provide suitable habitats for Culex mosquito species, which serve as the primary vectors for WNV transmission. These mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected migratory birds, which serve as the natural reservoir hosts. The virus then amplifies in the mosquito population and can be transmitted to humans and horses through subsequent mosquito bites. The enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes continues throughout the warm season, with human infections representing incidental spillover events rather than contributing to ongoing transmission.\nDuring week 44 specifically, no new West Nile virus cases were detected, consistent with the expected seasonal decline in transmission as temperatures decrease and mosquito populations dwindle. However, the single case documented earlier in the year serves as a reminder that surveillance infrastructure must remain vigilant for this potentially severe neuroinvasive disease.\nTick-borne diseases continue to circulate in Bulgaria, with Lyme borreliosis representing the most frequently reported tick-borne infection. Week 44 saw seven confirmed cases of Lyme borreliosis, bringing the year-to-date total to 358 cases, compared with 349 cases during the same period in 2024. This modest increase of nine cases suggests stable endemic transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato through Ixodes tick vectors. Lyme disease typically manifests initially with the characteristic erythema migrans rash at the site of tick attachment, followed potentially by disseminated infection involving the nervous system, heart, or joints if left untreated. The autumn season traditionally sees declining Lyme disease incidence as tick activity diminishes with cooler weather, though cases diagnosed in autumn often represent infections acquired during peak summer tick activity with delayed clinical presentation.\nMediterranean spotted fever, known locally as Marseilles fever, continues to be documented in Bulgaria, with one confirmed case reported during week 44, bringing the annual total to 76 cases. This represents a slight decrease from the 81 cases documented in 2024. Mediterranean spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia conorii transmitted by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The disease presents with fever, headache, and a characteristic papular rash, along with the pathognomonic tache noire, a dark eschar at the site of tick attachment. The continuing documentation of cases underscores the endemic nature of this rickettsial disease in the Balkan region.\n\n\nGastrointestinal and Foodborne Infections\nGastrointestinal infections represent a significant proportion of Bulgaria’s infectious disease burden, with multiple pathogens contributing to the overall epidemiological picture. During week 44, the country reported 178 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis of various etiologies, including 87 possible cases, 84 probable cases, and seven confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 8,194 cases represents a decrease of 479 cases compared with the 8,673 cases documented during the equivalent period in 2024, suggesting a modest downward trend in overall gastrointestinal disease burden.\nSalmonellosis continues to circulate at endemic levels, with 15 confirmed cases reported during week 44. The cumulative annual total of 612 cases represents a substantial decrease from the 856 cases documented in 2024, with the reduction of 244 cases potentially reflecting improved food safety measures, changes in agricultural practices affecting animal reservoirs, or shifts in dietary patterns affecting exposure to contaminated foods. Salmonellosis typically results from consumption of contaminated poultry products, eggs, or produce, with symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping developing 12 to 72 hours after exposure.\nCampylobacteriosis demonstrated increased activity during week 44, with 14 cases reported, bringing the annual total to 398 cases. This represents a notable increase of 119 cases compared with the 279 cases documented in 2024, potentially reflecting enhanced laboratory detection capabilities, changes in food production or handling practices, or true increases in infection incidence. Campylobacter species, particularly Campylobacter jejuni, represent the most common bacterial cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and are typically acquired through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, or contaminated water.\nRotavirus gastroenteritis continues to affect primarily pediatric populations, with 11 confirmed cases reported during week 44. The year-to-date total of 641 cases remains relatively stable compared with the 648 cases in 2024. Rotavirus remains a leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in young children despite the availability of effective vaccines, with transmission occurring through the fecal-oral route in settings where young children congregate.\nFive confirmed cases of E. coli enteritis were documented during week 44, contributing to an annual total of 275 cases. This represents a decline from the 309 cases reported in 2024. While no cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli were reported, the ongoing surveillance for these potentially severe infections remains important given their capacity to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, particularly in young children.\n\n\nRespiratory and Invasive Bacterial Infections\nCOVID-19 surveillance continues in Bulgaria, with 228 confirmed cases reported during week 44, representing a decline of 30 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 2,491 cases reflects a dramatic reduction from the 14,341 cases documented during the same period in 2024, with the decrease of 11,850 cases consistent with global trends showing declining COVID-19 incidence as population immunity from vaccination and previous infection accumulates. However, the continuing documentation of several hundred cases weekly underscores that SARS-CoV-2 remains in circulation and continues to cause symptomatic disease requiring medical attention.\nVaricella, commonly known as chickenpox, demonstrated substantial activity during week 44, with 312 cases reported. The annual total of 17,781 cases represents a decrease of 4,600 cases from the 22,381 cases in 2024. Varicella remains a highly contagious disease primarily affecting children, transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular lesions. The disease typically presents with a characteristic pruritic vesicular rash along with fever and malaise. While usually self-limited in healthy children, varicella can cause serious complications in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and occasionally in healthy adults.\nScarlet fever activity continued during week 44, with 53 cases reported, including 17 possible, 26 probable, and 10 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 2,926 cases represents a substantial decrease from the 7,640 cases documented in 2024. Scarlet fever is caused by group A streptococcus producing erythrogenic toxins and presents with fever, pharyngitis, and a characteristic sandpaper-like rash. The decline may reflect natural cyclical variations in streptococcal disease activity or changes in diagnostic practices.\nInvasive bacterial meningitis cases remain under close surveillance, with three cases of bacterial meningitis due to other or unspecified organisms reported during week 44. No cases of pneumococcal, streptococcal, or Haemophilus influenzae meningitis were documented during the reporting week. The annual total of 13 meningococcal infections represents an increase from six cases in 2024, warranting continued vigilance for this potentially rapidly fatal infection.\nOne case of Legionnaires’ disease was confirmed during week 44, bringing the annual total to 11 cases, compared with 10 cases in 2024. Legionnaires’ disease results from inhalation of water aerosols contaminated with Legionella pneumophila and presents as severe pneumonia that can be fatal without appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sporadic cases typically reflect environmental exposure in buildings with contaminated water systems.\n\n\nViral Hepatitis\nAcute viral hepatitis demonstrated increased activity during week 44, with 44 cases reported, including six possible, two probable, and 36 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 1,236 cases represents a substantial increase of 656 cases compared with the 580 cases documented in 2024. This significant increase warrants detailed investigation to determine whether it reflects increased transmission of specific hepatitis viruses, changes in diagnostic practices with increased testing, or reporting artifacts. Viral hepatitis encompasses multiple etiologic agents including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, each with distinct epidemiologic characteristics, transmission routes, and clinical implications.\n\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSexually transmitted infections continue to represent an important public health concern in Bulgaria, with ongoing transmission of multiple pathogens documented through surveillance systems. Week 44 saw 10 confirmed HIV infections, bringing the year-to-date total to 259 cases, representing an increase of 21 cases compared with the 238 cases in 2024. This upward trend in HIV diagnoses may reflect increased transmission, improved case detection through expanded testing initiatives, or delayed diagnoses of infections acquired in previous years.\nSyphilis surveillance documented six confirmed cases during week 44, contributing to an annual total of 304 cases, compared with 282 cases in 2024. Particularly concerning is the documentation of 33 cases of congenital syphilis during 2025, a dramatic increase from the 12 cases in 2024. Congenital syphilis results from maternal-fetal transmission during pregnancy and can cause severe fetal and neonatal complications including stillbirth, neonatal death, and serious long-term sequelae in survivors. The substantial increase in congenital syphilis cases suggests gaps in prenatal screening and treatment programs that require urgent public health attention.\nUrogenital chlamydial infection showed seven confirmed cases during week 44, with the annual total of 161 cases representing a substantial increase from the 91 cases in 2024. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can cause cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease if left untreated, with potential complications including ectopic pregnancy and infertility.\nGonorrhea surveillance documented three confirmed cases during week 44, contributing to a year-to-date total of 103 cases, compared with 79 cases in 2024. The increasing trend in gonorrhea cases parallels global patterns and raises concerns about antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which has developed resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics historically used for treatment.\n\n\nRare and Emerging Infections\nSeveral rare infections were documented in Bulgaria during 2025, though no new cases occurred during week 44. Single cases of botulism, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and typhoid fever were reported during the year, along with four cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, five dengue cases, and two mpox cases. The documentation of these relatively rare infections underscores the importance of comprehensive surveillance systems capable of detecting diverse pathogens and the global mobility of populations that can introduce infections from endemic areas.\nPertussis, which caused a substantial outbreak in 2024 with 2,668 cases, has shown dramatically reduced activity in 2025, with only 82 cases reported year-to-date. This represents a decrease of 2,586 cases and likely reflects the cyclical nature of pertussis epidemiology, with epidemic peaks occurring every three to five years followed by inter-epidemic periods of low transmission."

    "text": "Public Health Implications and Disease Control Strategies\n\nUnderstanding Vector-Borne Disease Trends\nThe epidemiological data from week 44 reinforces several critical observations about the changing landscape of vector-borne diseases in Europe. The persistence of WNV and chikungunya cases into November indicates warming trends and the establishment of competent vectors across broader European territories. Historical transmission seasons for these diseases typically concluded by mid-October, but the documentation of cases extending into November suggests that climate change is creating conditions favorable for prolonged vector activity. The involvement of 13 countries in WNV surveillance, coupled with autochthonous chikungunya transmission in previously unaffected regions, demonstrates the northward expansion of arboviral disease risk.\nThe 48 fatalities associated with West Nile virus in Italy underscore the severe outcomes possible in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, necessitating targeted prevention strategies for vulnerable populations. The neuroinvasive complications of WNV infection can result in long-term disability even among survivors, with some patients experiencing persistent neurological sequelae including memory problems, difficulty with concentration, and mood disorders. This burden of disease extends beyond the acute illness and requires consideration in public health planning and resource allocation.\n\n\nIntegrated Vector Management Approaches\nControl of vector-borne diseases requires comprehensive integrated vector management strategies that combine multiple interventions to reduce disease transmission. For West Nile virus prevention, the primary focus centers on reducing Culex mosquito populations through environmental management and targeted larviciding. This includes eliminating standing water in artificial containers, treating catch basins and storm drains with larvicides, and managing vegetation around water bodies to reduce mosquito resting sites. Public health authorities conduct mosquito surveillance through trapping programs that monitor adult mosquito populations and test pools of mosquitoes for viral infection, providing early warning of viral activity before human cases occur.\nBird surveillance also plays a crucial role in WNV monitoring, as increased mortality among corvid species such as crows and blue jays often precedes human cases by several weeks. Dead bird surveillance programs allow public health officials to detect viral introduction into new areas and intensify control measures proactively. Equine surveillance provides another layer of early warning, as horses develop clinical disease with greater frequency than humans and are often infected before human cases emerge.\nFor chikungunya control, the focus shifts to managing Aedes albopictus populations, which requires different strategies than Culex control. Asian tiger mosquitoes breed in small artificial water-holding containers found in urban and suburban environments, including plant saucers, discarded tires, clogged gutters, and children’s toys. Control programs emphasize community engagement and source reduction, encouraging residents to eliminate potential breeding sites on their properties. This type of “backyard ecology” requires sustained public education campaigns and community mobilization to achieve meaningful reductions in mosquito populations. Adulticiding through ultra-low volume spraying can provide temporary relief during outbreaks but is not sustainable as a long-term control strategy due to the rapid recolonization ability of Aedes mosquitoes and concerns about insecticide resistance.\nPersonal protective measures remain essential for both WNV and chikungunya prevention. Public health messaging emphasizes the use of EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin. Wearing long sleeves and long pants, particularly during peak mosquito activity times, provides mechanical protection against bites. Installing or repairing window and door screens prevents mosquitoes from entering indoor living spaces, and the use of air conditioning when available reduces human exposure by allowing people to remain indoors during peak transmission periods.\n\n\nSurveillance and Response Systems\nActive surveillance systems across Europe continue to provide critical early warning capabilities that enable rapid public health response. Real-time case reporting through integrated surveillance platforms allows health authorities to detect clusters and outbreaks quickly, enabling targeted interventions before widespread transmission occurs. Entomological surveillance guides vector control interventions by identifying areas of high vector density and viral activity, allowing resources to be deployed efficiently to areas of greatest risk. Cross-border collaboration through ECDC and other European networks facilitates coordinated public health action, ensuring that disease trends are recognized and addressed at the regional level rather than solely within individual countries.\nRisk communication strategies adapted to local transmission intensity help maintain public awareness without generating unnecessary alarm. During periods of high transmission, public health authorities issue advisories encouraging enhanced personal protective measures and may recommend cancellation of outdoor evening activities in high-risk areas. Laboratory-based surveillance through sentinel physician networks and hospital-based reporting provides denominator data that allows calculation of disease incidence rates and monitoring of temporal trends. The integration of human, animal, and vector surveillance exemplifies the One Health approach to disease prevention, recognizing that human health is inextricably linked to animal health and environmental factors."

    "text": "Recommendations for Health Professionals\nHealthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for arboviral infections in febrile patients with appropriate exposure history, particularly during the transmission season. West Nile virus should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with unexplained encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, especially in individuals over 50 years of age or with immunocompromising conditions. Diagnostic testing through serology, PCR, or viral culture should be pursued promptly, and suspected cases should be reported to national surveillance systems according to local protocols. Clinical management remains primarily supportive, as no specific antiviral therapy exists for West Nile virus or chikungunya infections.\nFor chikungunya, the characteristic severe arthralgia provides an important diagnostic clue, particularly when fever and joint pain develop suddenly in patients without recent travel to traditionally endemic areas. Clinicians should recognize that autochthonous transmission now occurs in Europe and maintain awareness of local transmission patterns. Management focuses on symptomatic relief with analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, with some patients requiring short-term use of corticosteroids for persistent arthritis.\nVector control professionals should continue eliminating mosquito breeding sites in urban and peri-urban environments through source reduction campaigns and consider larvicidal treatments in high-risk areas where breeding site elimination is not feasible. Resistance monitoring should guide insecticide selection to ensure continued efficacy of control programs. Public education campaigns should continue emphasizing personal protective measures and community participation in source reduction efforts.\nPublic health officials should anticipate potential persistence of transmission due to climate factors and prepare for the 2026 transmission season by incorporating lessons learned from current surveillance data. This includes enhancing laboratory capacity for arboviral diagnostics, training healthcare providers in recognition and management of arboviral diseases, and developing risk communication materials appropriate for diverse populations. Vaccine development efforts for West Nile virus and chikungunya should be supported, as immunization represents the most sustainable long-term approach to disease prevention."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWeek 44 of 2025 demonstrates that infectious disease surveillance and public health preparedness remain critical across multiple geographic scales, from global pharmaceutical development to national disease monitoring systems. The 989 West Nile virus cases across Europe, hundreds of chikungunya infections establishing autochthonous transmission in previously unaffected areas, and Bulgaria’s diverse infectious disease portfolio spanning vector-borne diseases, gastrointestinal infections, sexually transmitted infections, and respiratory pathogens collectively illustrate the complex epidemiological landscape of contemporary Europe.\nThe regulatory approval of novel therapeutics for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and refractory immune thrombocytopenia by the European Medicines Agency represents significant advances in addressing conditions with substantial unmet medical needs. These pharmaceutical developments complement infectious disease control efforts by expanding the therapeutic armamentarium available to clinicians managing chronic diseases that may increase susceptibility to infections or complicate their management.\nBulgaria’s comprehensive surveillance data for week 44 and the year-to-date period reveal several epidemiological trends warranting attention. The dramatic increase in congenital syphilis cases from 12 in 2024 to 33 in 2025 represents a public health emergency requiring immediate enhancement of prenatal screening and treatment programs. The substantial increase in viral hepatitis cases, from 580 to 1,236 annually, necessitates detailed investigation to characterize the etiologic agents involved and identify transmission chains amenable to intervention. Conversely, the dramatic decline in pertussis from 2,668 cases in 2024 to 82 in 2025 demonstrates the cyclical nature of some infectious diseases and the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent resurgence.\nThe persistence of arboviral transmission into November across Europe, including Bulgaria’s participation in regional West Nile virus surveillance despite documenting only one case in 2025, signals fundamental shifts in the ecology of disease transmission. The country’s position within the endemic Balkan region places it at ongoing risk not only for West Nile virus but potentially for future introduction of chikungunya transmission should Aedes albopictus populations become established. The coordination between national surveillance systems, particularly the work of the Bulgarian National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, and European agencies such as ECDC and EFSA provides the essential foundation for effective monitoring and response to emerging and re-emerging infectious disease threats.\nThe integration of human, veterinary, and entomological surveillance through One Health approaches has proven essential for early detection and response to zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. The ability to detect viral activity in mosquito and bird populations before human cases emerge allows public health authorities to implement preventive measures and issue timely warnings to vulnerable populations. The continued refinement of these integrated surveillance systems will be crucial as climate change continues to alter the geographic distribution and seasonal timing of vector-borne disease transmission, while global travel patterns facilitate rapid pathogen dispersal across continents.\nAs Europe transitions into the cooler months, sustained vigilance remains essential across all components of the infectious disease surveillance and response infrastructure. Public health authorities are incorporating lessons learned from the 2025 transmission season into preparations for 2026, recognizing that each year provides new insights into the changing ecology of these diseases. The ongoing documentation of autochthonous chikungunya transmission in France and Italy, the concerning trends in sexually transmitted infections in Bulgaria, and the regulatory advances in chronic disease management collectively underscore that public health in the 21st century requires comprehensive, coordinated, and adaptive approaches that span infectious and non-communicable diseases, national and international boundaries, and human and animal health sectors."

    "text": "Европа: Инфекциозните Болести\n\nЗападнонилска треска\nКъм 3 октомври 2025 г. европейската система за наблюдение е регистрирала 989 потвърдени случая на ЗНТ в 13 държави-членки. Италия води с 714 случая, от които 48 са починали. Основно засегнатите региони включват Лацио и Кампания, където екологичните условия благоприятстват постоянно размножаване на комари и популации на птици, които поддържат циркулацията на вируса. Смъртността подчертава тежестта на инфекциите при уязвими популации, особено възрастните и тези с имуносупресия. Гърция, Сърбия и други балкански държави продължават да докладват активно предаване (първите случаи бяха регистрирани през Юли).\nГеографското разпределение демонстрира устойчивото установяване на цикли на предаване на ЗНТ в Южна и Югоизточна Европа, като комарите-вектори поддържат висока активност дори в края на лятото и началото на есента. Вирусът на ЗНТ се предава главно чрез ухапване от заразени комари от род Culex, особено Culex pipiens. Тези комари обикновено се хранят през вечерните и нощните часове, с пикова активност на ухапване по здрач и зазоряване. Вирусът не може да се предава от човек на човек чрез случаен контакт, въпреки че са документирани редки случаи на предаване чрез кръвопреливане, трансплантация на органи и от майка на плод по време на бременност.\nМнозинството от инфекциите с ЗНТ, приблизително 80 процента, остават безсимптомни. Около 20 процента от заразените индивиди развиват заболяване, характеризиращо се с внезапно начало на температура, главоболие, болки в мускули и стави и понякога обрив. По-малко от 1 процент от инфекциите прогресират до тежко невроинвазивно заболяване, включително енцефалит, менингит или остра вяла парализа. Рискът от тежко заболяване се увеличава драматично с възрастта, особено при индивиди над 60 години, и при тези с имуносупресия.\n\n\nЧикунгуня: Епидемиология и Появяващо се Европейско Предаване\nАвтохтонното предаване на чикунгуня представлява нарастваща загриженост за общественото здраве в Южна Европа, маркирайки значителна промяна в епидемиологията на това заболяване. Франция е докладвала общо 768 случая с 13 нови случая, документирани тази седмица. Учените там говорят за “групирани модели” на предаване, които предполагат наличието на локализирани огнища с продължаващ риск за предаване. Италия е натрупала 370 случаи с един нов случай в тази седмица и с отчетливо географско групиране.\nУстойчивото предаване на чикунгуня, заболяване традиционно свързано с тропически и субтропически региони на Африка, Азия и островите в Индийския океан, сигнализира за разширяващия се обхват на компетентни вектори и адаптацията на предаването към европейските климатични условия. Основният вектор, отговорен за европейското предаване, е Aedes albopictus. Този високо адаптивен вид комар успешно е колонизирал голяма част от Южна Европа през последните две десетилетия, възползвайки се от международната търговия и пътувания, за да установи популации далеч от своя роден Югоизточноазиатски обхват. За разлика от комарите Culex, които предават вируса на ЗНТ, Aedes albopictus се храни през деня, с пикова активност на ухапване през ранните сутрешни и късните следобедни часове.\nВирусът чикунгуня се предава директно във веригата човек -&gt; комар -&gt; човек, без да изисква птичи или животински резервоар. Когато комар ухапе заразено лице по време на виремичната фаза на заболяването, обикновено през първата седмица от симптомите, той може да придобие вируса и впоследствие да го предаде на други хора. Този директен цикъл на предаване от човек на човек чрез комари-вектори позволява бърза амплификация на случаите в райони с висока плътност на компетентни комари и податливи човешки популации. Заболяването се проявява с внезапно начало на висока треска и тежка ставна болка, често толкова инвалидизираща, че пациентите имат трудности при ходене. Името “чикунгуня” произлиза от думата на Кимаконде, означаваща “да се изкривиш”, отнасяща се до прегърбената поза на пациенти, страдащи от тежка артралгия. Макар рядко фатална, ставната болка може да персистира месеци или дори години при някои пациенти, причинявайки значителна морбидност и намалено качество на живот.\nУстановяването на автохтонно предаване във Франция и Италия представлява сигнално събитие в европейската епидемиология на инфекциозните болести. Преди това случаите на чикунгуня в Европа бяха изключително свързани с пътувания, като пациентите бяха придобили инфекцията по време на посещения в ендемични райони. Документирането на локално предаване показва, че всички три необходими компонента за устойчиво арбовирусно заболяване са се изравнили: популации на компетентни вектори, подходящи климатични условия за вирусна репликация и предаване, и достатъчен брой податливи гостоприемници. Тази епидемиологична трансформация има важни последици за готовността на общественото здраве и стратегиите за контрол на векторите в целия континент.\n\n\nДруга инфекциозна активност в Европа\nСърбия докладва 40 потвърдени случая на маймунска вариола (mpox). Спорадични случаи в съседни страни (Гърция, Македония, Турция, Румъния) демонстрират продължаващо предаване, макар и на по-ниски нива от тези, наблюдавани по време на пика на международното огнище от 2022-2023 г. Маймунската вариола се причинява от ортопоксвирус, свързан с вируса, причиняващ едра шарка. За разлика от арбовирусните заболявания, обсъдени по-горе, маймунската вариола се предава чрез близък контакт със заразени индивиди, включително директен контакт с кожни лезии, респираторни капчици по време на продължителен контакт лице в лице и потенциално чрез замърсени материали като спално бельо или облекло.\nНастоящото огнище в Европа е предимно причинено от клад IIb на вируса и засяга предимно мрежи мъже с интимни контакти с мъже (МИКМ). Заболяването обикновено се проявява с треска, главоболие, мускулни болки и изтощение, последвани от развитието на характерен обрив, който прогресира през етапи от макули до папули, везикули, пустули и накрая крусти. Засиленото проследяване на контакти и протоколи за изолация остават критични за ограничаване на веригите на предаване, заедно с насочени ваксинационни кампании.\nАктивността на респираторните вируси продължава под рутинно сезонно наблюдение. Системите за наблюдение остават подготвени за потенциална ко-циркулация на грип, респираторен синцитиален вирус и SARS-CoV-2."

    "text": "България\n\nВекторно преносими болести\nПозицията на България в ендемичния балкански регион я поставя в продължаващ риск от векторно преносими болести, особено за ЗНТ. През 2025 г. страната е документирала един потвърден случай, представляващ драматичен спад от 28-те случая, докладвани през същия период през 2024 г. Това съществено намаление може да отразява няколко фактора, включително вариации в плътността на комарската популация, повлияна от климатични условия, промени в миграционните модели на птиците, засягащи вирусното въвеждане и амплификация, или потенциално по-ефективни мерки за контрол на векторите.\nЗаболяванията, предавани от кърлежи, продължават да циркулират в България, като лаймската борелиоза представлява най-често докладваната инфекция, предавана от кърлежи. През изминалата седмица са регистрирани седем потвърдени случая на лаймска борелиоза, а с тях от началото на годината са докладни общо 358 случая, в сравнение с 349 случая през същия период през 2024 г. Това умерено увеличение предполага стабилно ендемично предаване на Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato чрез кърлежи-вектори от род Ixodes. Лаймската болест обикновено се проявява първоначално с характерния си обрив - еритема мигранс на мястото на прикрепване на кърлежа, последван потенциално от дисеминирана инфекция, засягаща нервната система, сърцето или ставите. Есенният сезон традиционно е свързван с намаляваща честота на лаймската болест, тъй като активността на кърлежите намалява, въпреки че случаите, диагностицирани през есента, често представляват инфекции, придобити по време на пиковата лятна активност с забавена клинична проява.\nТази седмица е докладван е и един случай на марсилска треска, довеждайки годишната обща стойност до 76 случая. Това представлява леко намаление от 81-те случая, документирани през 2024 г. Средиземноморската петниста треска се причинява от Rickettsia conorii, предавана от кафявия кучешки кърлеж Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Заболяването се проявява с треска, главоболие и характерен папулозен обрив, заедно с патогномоничната tache noire, тъмен струпей на мястото на прикрепване на кърлежа. Продължаващото документиране на случаи подчертава ендемичната природа на това рикетсиално заболяване в балканския регион.\n\n\nСтомашно-Чревни и Хранително Предавани Инфекции\nСтомашно-чревните инфекции представляват значителна част от бремето на инфекциозните болести в България, като множество патогени допринасят за общата епидемиологична картина. През изминалата седмица в страната ни са докладвани 178 случая на гастроентерит и ентероколит от различни причинители. Общата стойност на заболелите от началото на годината е 8 194, което представлява намаление от 479 случая в сравнение с 2024 г.\nСалмонелозата продължава да циркулира на ендемични нива, с 15 потвърдени случая. Кумулативната годишна обща стойност е 612 случая, което е значително по-малко от 856-те случая, документирани през 2024 г. Описаното намаление вероятно отразява подобрени мерки за безопасност на храните, промени в земеделските практики, засягащи животински резервоари, или промени в хранителните модели, засягащи експозицията на замърсени храни.\nКампилобактериозата демонстрира повишена активност през периода с 14 нови докладвани случая. До момента са регистрирани с 119 случая повече спрямо 2024 г. Видовете Campylobacter, особено Campylobacter jejuni, представляват най-честата бактериална причина за гастроентерит в световен мащаб и обикновено се придобиват чрез консумация на недоварено птиче месо, непастьоризирано мляко или замърсена вода.\nРотавирусният гастроентерит продължава да засяга предимно педиатричните популации, с 11 нови потвърдени случая. Общата стойност от началото на годината от 641 случая остава относително стабилна спрямо 2024 г. Ротавирусът остава водеща причина за тежка дехидратираща диария при малки деца, въпреки наличността на ефективни ваксини, като предаването се случва чрез фекално-оралния път в условия, където се събират малки деца.\n\n\nРеспираторни инфекции\nНаблюдението на COVID-19 разкрива 228 нови потвърдени случая, което е спад от 30 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Общата стойност от началото на годината е 2 491.\nВарицелата демонстрира съществена активност с нови 312 заболели. От началото на година до момента са регистрирани 17 781 случая, което е намаление с 4 600 случая спрямо същия период на 2024 г. Варицелата остава високо заразна болест, засягаща предимно деца, предавана чрез респираторни капчици и директен контакт с везикулни лезии. Заболяването обикновено се проявява с характерен сърбящ везикулен обрив заедно с треска. Въпреки че обикновено е самоограничаваща се при здрави деца, варицелата може да причини сериозни усложнения при имунокомпрометирани индивиди, бременни жени и понякога при здрави възрастни.\nАктивността на скарлатината продължава на стабилни нива спрямо 2024 г. с 53 нови докладвани случая, включително 17 възможни, 26 вероятни и 10 потвърдени.\nСлучаите на бактериален менингит остават под внимателно наблюдение, с три нови заболели докладвани през седмицата.\nПрез 44-та седмица се установява и един заболял с легионеонелоза. Legionella pneumophila се проявява като тежка пневмония, която може да бъде фатална без подходяща антибиотична терапия. Спорадичните случаи обикновено отразяват екологична експозиция в сгради със замърсени водни системи.\n\n\nВирусен Хепатит\nОстрият вирусен хепатит демонстрира повишена активност през 44-та седмица, с 44 докладвани случая, в това число шест възможни, два вероятни и 36 потвърдени.\n\n\nСексуално Предавани Инфекции\nСексуално предаваните инфекции продължават да представляват важна загриженост за общественото здраве в България, с продължаващо предаване на множество патогени, документирано чрез системите за наблюдение. През изминалата седмица са регистрирани 10 нови пациенти с потвърдена HIV инфекция.\nНаблюдението на сифилис документира шест потвърдени случая, допринасяйки за натрупването от 304 случая от началото на годината. Особено притеснително е документирането на общо 33 случая на вроден сифилис до момента, което е драматично увеличение спрямо 12-те случая през същият период на 2024 г.\nУстановени са още 3 нови потвърдени случая на гонорея. Нарастващата тенденция в случаите е паралелна на глобалните модели и повдига загрижености относно антимикробната резистентност."

    "section": "Historical Development of EU Health Collaboration",
    "text": "Historical Development of EU Health Collaboration\n\nThe Foundation Period: From Rome to Maastricht (1957-1992)\nThe Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community in 1957 contained no explicit provisions for health policy. The founding member states conceived of European integration primarily in economic terms, focused on creating a common market and customs union. Health systems, deeply rooted in national traditions and political systems, remained firmly under national control. The early decades of European integration saw health issues addressed only indirectly through provisions related to the free movement of workers and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.\nThe primary health-related activities during this period concerned occupational health and safety. The treaty provisions on working conditions provided a legal basis for directives addressing workplace hazards, exposure to dangerous substances, and health protection for specific categories of workers. Additionally, the recognition that healthcare professionals must be able to move freely within the common market led to directives on the mutual recognition of medical, nursing, and other health professional qualifications. These measures, while important, represented a narrow conception of health policy focused on removing barriers to economic integration rather than pursuing health as an intrinsic policy goal.\nThe Single European Act of 1986 marked a modest expansion of health-related provisions, introducing specific requirements for health and safety protection in the workplace and laying the groundwork for more systematic attention to health matters. However, the act maintained the fundamentally national character of health policy, with Community action limited to supporting and complementing member state initiatives.\n\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty and the Establishment of Health Competence (1992)\nThe Treaty on European Union, signed at Maastricht in 1992, represented a watershed moment for EU health policy. Article 129 of the treaty, subsequently renumbered as Article 168 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, established for the first time an explicit legal basis for Community action in public health. The article stated that the Community should contribute to ensuring a high level of human health protection by encouraging cooperation between member states and, if necessary, lending support to their action. Crucially, the treaty specified that Community action should be directed toward improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness, and obviating sources of danger to human health.\nThe Maastricht provisions incorporated two fundamental principles that continue to shape EU health policy. First, the principle of subsidiarity was explicitly enshrined, establishing that the EU should act only where objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states acting alone and can be better achieved at Union level. This principle reflects the recognition that healthcare organization and delivery remain essentially national responsibilities, shaped by distinct historical traditions, financing mechanisms, and political choices. Second, the treaty explicitly excluded the harmonization of laws and regulations of member states in the health field, meaning that the EU cannot impose uniform health policies or require member states to standardize their health systems.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the Maastricht Treaty opened new possibilities for EU action in public health. The establishment of health programs, the collection and analysis of health data, the promotion of research, and the encouragement of cooperation in addressing common health challenges all became legitimate EU activities. The treaty thus created a framework for meaningful EU involvement in health while respecting national prerogatives over healthcare systems.\n\n\nFrom Amsterdam to Lisbon: Strengthening Health Protection (1997-2009)\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force in 1999, built upon the Maastricht foundations by introducing the principle of health protection into all Community policies. The treaty stipulated that a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities, thereby establishing what came to be known as the Health in All Policies approach. This principle recognizes that health outcomes are determined not only by health services but also by social determinants including education, employment, environment, agriculture, transport, and other policy domains. By requiring health considerations to be integrated across all EU policy areas, the Amsterdam Treaty acknowledged the multifaceted nature of health and the need for policy coherence.\nSubsequent years saw the gradual expansion of EU health activities within this constitutional framework. Public health programs addressing specific issues such as cancer, AIDS, drug dependence, and health promotion were established and provided funding for collaborative projects between member states. The EU also began to develop regulatory frameworks for cross-border health issues, including standards for blood and blood products, human tissues and cells, and organ transplantation. These measures reflected growing recognition that certain health risks require coordinated action beyond national borders.\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009, consolidated and strengthened EU health provisions. The treaty maintained the core principles established at Maastricht while adding new dimensions to EU health competence. Importantly, Lisbon enhanced provisions related to cross-border health threats, authorizing the Union to adopt measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and medical devices, and measures concerning monitoring, early warning, and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The treaty thus provided a stronger legal foundation for EU action on health security and emergency preparedness, though these provisions would not be fully utilized until the COVID-19 pandemic more than a decade later.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and the Push for a European Health Union (2020-Present)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in early 2020 exposed both the strengths and limitations of existing EU health collaboration mechanisms. The initial months of the pandemic saw uncoordinated national responses, including border closures, competition for scarce medical supplies, and varying public health measures that sometimes worked at cross-purposes. The crisis demonstrated that health threats of such magnitude cannot be adequately addressed through voluntary cooperation alone, and that stronger coordination mechanisms and greater EU-level capacity are needed to respond effectively to health emergencies.\nIn response to these challenges, the EU undertook its most significant expansion of health activities since the Maastricht Treaty. In 2021, the European Commission established the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, known as HERA, to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to health emergencies. HERA’s mandate includes threat assessment, intelligence gathering, development and procurement of medical countermeasures, and coordination of emergency response. The establishment of HERA represents a qualitative shift toward greater EU capacity in health security, moving beyond purely coordinating functions to include operational responsibilities for stockpiling, procurement, and ensuring the availability of critical medical supplies.\nThe pandemic also led to a substantial strengthening of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Previously limited to providing scientific advice and conducting surveillance, ECDC received an enhanced mandate including the authority to activate the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan, conduct epidemiological investigations in member states, and support the development and deployment of medical countermeasures. These changes reflect lessons learned about the need for strong, authoritative scientific guidance during health emergencies.\nPerhaps most significantly, the pandemic catalyzed political momentum for what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen termed a “European Health Union.” This concept envisions a more integrated approach to health policy while maintaining respect for national competences over healthcare organization. The Health Union framework includes not only enhanced emergency preparedness and response mechanisms but also ambitious initiatives in areas such as cancer control, mental health, pharmaceutical policy, and digital health infrastructure. While the legal foundations of this Health Union rest on existing treaty provisions, the political commitment and financial resources dedicated to health have increased dramatically compared to the pre-pandemic era."

    "section": "The European Union: Constitutional Framework and Principles",
    "text": "The European Union: Constitutional Framework and Principles\n\nNature and Structure of the European Union\nTo understand EU health policy, it is essential to grasp the broader constitutional framework within which health collaboration occurs. The European Union is a unique political entity that combines supranational and intergovernmental elements. It is neither a traditional international organization where states retain full sovereignty nor a federal state where sovereignty is definitively transferred to central institutions. Rather, the EU represents a novel form of political organization in which member states have pooled sovereignty in specific policy areas while retaining autonomy in others.\nAs of 2025, the European Union comprises twenty-seven member states with a combined population of approximately 450 million citizens. The Union operates on the basis of the treaties voluntarily agreed by member states, which function as a constitutional framework defining the scope and limits of EU competence. The principle of conferral stipulates that the EU can act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by member states through the treaties. Any competences not conferred on the Union remain with member states.\nThe EU constitutional framework distinguishes between three types of competence. Exclusive competences are policy areas where only the EU may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, with member states able to do so only if empowered by the EU or for the implementation of EU acts. These areas include the customs union, competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market, monetary policy for euro area member states, and conservation of marine biological resources. Shared competences are areas where both the EU and member states may legislate and adopt legally binding acts. Member states exercise their competence to the extent that the EU has not exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence. Shared competences include the internal market, social policy, economic and social cohesion, agriculture and fisheries, environment, consumer protection, and transport. Supporting competences are areas where the EU may carry out actions to support, coordinate, or supplement member state actions, but cannot harmonize member state laws. Health, along with education, culture, tourism, vocational training, youth, sport, and civil protection, falls into this third category.\n\n\nThe Subsidiarity Principle in Health Policy\nThe classification of health as a supporting competence reflects the principle of subsidiarity, which is particularly important in understanding EU health policy. Subsidiarity holds that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen, and that action at Union level should only be undertaken when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states acting alone and can be better achieved at Union level. In the health context, this means that the organization, financing, and delivery of healthcare services remain national responsibilities, while the EU may act in areas where coordinated action yields benefits that individual member states cannot achieve independently.\nThe application of subsidiarity in health manifests in several ways. The EU may facilitate cooperation between member states, provide platforms for exchanging best practices, fund collaborative projects, and establish common frameworks for addressing issues with inherent cross-border dimensions. However, the EU cannot require member states to organize their health systems in particular ways, set binding standards for healthcare quality beyond specific technical areas, or dictate how national health budgets should be allocated. This constraint means that EU health policy operates primarily through soft coordination mechanisms, financial incentives, and regulatory standards in areas with clear cross-border implications.\n\n\nHealth in All Policies\nComplementing the principle of subsidiarity is the concept of Health in All Policies, which recognizes that health outcomes are shaped by decisions across multiple policy domains. The Treaty stipulates that a high level of human health protection must be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. This requirement reflects the understanding that policies in areas such as agriculture, environment, transport, employment, and trade all have significant health implications.\nImplementing Health in All Policies requires mechanisms for assessing health impacts of proposed policies, integrating health considerations into decision-making processes across sectors, and building partnerships between health and non-health actors. At the EU level, this includes health impact assessments of major legislative proposals, inter-service consultation processes within the European Commission, and dedicated efforts to address health in specific policy areas such as environmental regulation, food safety standards, and chemical legislation. The effectiveness of Health in All Policies depends not only on formal procedures but also on institutional culture, political commitment, and the capacity to identify and articulate health implications of policies that may not have obvious health connections."

    "title": "European Union Health Collaboration",
    "section": "Legal Framework for EU Health Action",
    "text": "Legal Framework for EU Health Action\n\nPrimary Legal Basis: Article 168 TFEU\nThe primary legal foundation for EU health policy is Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This article, originally introduced by the Maastricht Treaty as Article 129 and subsequently renumbered, establishes both the scope and the limits of EU competence in health matters. Understanding this article is essential for grasping what the EU can and cannot do in the health field.\nArticle 168 begins by establishing that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, is to be directed toward improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. The article specifies several mechanisms through which the Union and member states should foster cooperation, including initiatives to set high standards of quality and safety, measures in veterinary and phytosanitary fields with health protection as a direct objective, and measures concerning monitoring, early warning of, and combating serious cross-border threats to health.\nCritically, Article 168 explicitly states that Union action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of member states for the definition of their health policy and for the organization and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of member states include the management of health services and medical care, and the allocation of resources assigned to health services and medical care. The paragraph further specifies that measures adopted pursuant to Article 168 shall not prevent member states from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures compatible with the treaties.\nThe article authorizes the European Parliament and Council to adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health, and in particular to combat major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of, and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use. However, the article explicitly excludes any harmonization of laws and regulations of member states in these areas. The Council may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in Article 168, though such recommendations are not legally binding.\nThis legal framework creates a nuanced space for EU action. The EU can establish common standards in specific technical areas such as pharmaceutical regulation and medical device safety, coordinate responses to cross-border health threats, fund health projects and programs, facilitate information exchange and best practice sharing, and promote health considerations across all policy domains. What the EU cannot do is harmonize national health laws, impose uniform health system structures, dictate national healthcare budgets or priorities, or interfere with member states’ fundamental choices about healthcare organization and financing.\n\n\nCross-Border Healthcare Legislation\nOne of the most significant pieces of EU health legislation is Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. This directive, adopted after years of negotiation and building on case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union, establishes a framework for patients seeking healthcare in member states other than their country of affiliation. The directive recognizes that while healthcare remains a national competence, the principles of free movement require that patients have the right to access healthcare in other member states under certain conditions.\nThe directive establishes that patients have the right to receive healthcare in another member state and to be reimbursed for that care up to the level that would have been provided by their home member state. Patients are not required to seek prior authorization for most types of care, though member states may maintain prior authorization requirements for hospital care or highly specialized treatments that meet certain criteria. The directive also establishes that the healthcare provider is responsible for the quality and safety of care provided, while the patient’s home member state is responsible for reimbursement.\nBeyond individual patient mobility, Directive 2011/24/EU also established frameworks for cooperation between member states on healthcare issues. These include provisions for European Reference Networks, which are virtual networks connecting healthcare providers across Europe to share expertise on rare and complex conditions. The directive also addresses mutual recognition of prescriptions issued in other member states, cooperation on health technology assessment, and mechanisms for sharing information about healthcare providers and patient rights. While the directive has been criticized for complexity and limited impact on actual patient mobility, it represents an important recognition of the cross-border dimensions of healthcare in an integrated Europe.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Regulation\nThe EU has developed extensive regulatory frameworks for medicinal products, reflecting the recognition that the safety, quality, and efficacy of medicines are matters of common interest that benefit from coordinated approaches. The regulatory system operates through two complementary mechanisms: a centralized authorization procedure managed by the European Medicines Agency, and decentralized and mutual recognition procedures coordinated between national medicines agencies.\nRegulation 726/2004 establishes the centralized procedure, which is mandatory for certain categories of medicines including those derived from biotechnology processes, orphan medicinal products for rare diseases, advanced therapy medicinal products, and medicines for human use containing new active substances for specific therapeutic areas. For these products, a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission based on EMA assessment is valid throughout the European Union. This centralized system ensures uniform scientific standards, avoids duplication of assessment efforts, and facilitates access to innovative medicines across the EU.\nThe Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, codified in Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, establishes comprehensive requirements for the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines, manufacturing standards, labeling and packaging requirements, advertising restrictions, and pharmacovigilance obligations. The directive has been amended numerous times to address emerging issues such as falsified medicines, the regulation of herbal medicinal products, and enhanced pharmacovigilance requirements following safety scandals.\nClinical trials of medicinal products are governed by Regulation 536/2014, which replaced the previous Clinical Trials Directive. The regulation aims to simplify procedures, harmonize assessment processes across member states, and increase transparency through a publicly accessible EU database of clinical trials. The regulation establishes a coordinated assessment procedure whereby sponsors submit a single application through an EU portal, with one member state serving as reporting member state coordinating the assessment. This system is designed to facilitate multinational clinical trials while maintaining high ethical and safety standards.\nPharmaceutical regulation represents an area where the EU has successfully balanced the need for coordinated action with respect for national competences. While authorization, safety monitoring, and quality standards are significantly harmonized, pricing and reimbursement decisions remain national competences. Member states retain the authority to decide which medicines to include in their national health insurance systems and at what price, though the EU facilitates voluntary cooperation on health technology assessment to support these decisions.\n\n\nMedical Devices Regulation\nThe regulation of medical devices underwent comprehensive reform with the adoption of Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices and Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. These regulations, which replaced earlier directives, established significantly more stringent requirements for medical devices based on lessons learned from safety scandals and recognition of gaps in the previous system.\nThe medical devices regulations introduce more rigorous clinical evidence requirements, particularly for high-risk devices. Manufacturers must provide more extensive clinical data demonstrating safety and performance, and the regulations strengthen requirements for post-market surveillance and vigilance. The regulations establish a Unique Device Identification system to improve traceability of devices throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing through distribution to use in clinical settings. The regulations also introduced more stringent requirements for notified bodies, the independent organizations that assess device conformity, including more intensive oversight and mandatory unannounced audits.\nThe medical devices regulations exemplify the EU’s approach to balancing innovation with patient safety. While the regulations are more demanding than their predecessors, they maintain a risk-based approach that avoids unnecessarily burdening lower-risk devices with requirements designed for high-risk implantable devices. The regulations also include provisions to support innovation, such as innovation offices within notified bodies and provisions for custom-made devices and devices manufactured in health institutions.\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control and Health Security\nThe legal framework for communicating disease control and health security has evolved significantly, particularly in response to new and emerging health threats. Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health establishes mechanisms for coordination, early warning, and response to health threats including communicable diseases, threats of biological, chemical, environmental, or unknown origin, and other events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern.\nThe decision establishes the Early Warning and Response System, through which member states must notify the Commission and other member states of serious cross-border threats to health. The system enables rapid exchange of information and coordination of response measures. The decision also provides for risk assessment by relevant EU agencies, development of preparedness and response plans, and coordination of risk communication. While member states retain primary responsibility for protecting public health on their territories, the decision creates obligations for notification and cooperation that strengthen collective capacity to address threats that transcend borders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to further strengthening of health security provisions. Regulations adopted in 2022 expanded the mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to include enhanced surveillance capabilities, authority to conduct epidemiological investigations in member states in coordination with national authorities, and responsibilities for supporting preparedness planning and response coordination. These regulations also established the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan, providing a framework for coordinated EU-level action during health crises while respecting member state competences.\n\n\nStandards for Blood, Tissues, Cells, and Organs\nThe EU has established comprehensive quality and safety standards for substances of human origin used in medical treatments. Directive 2002/98/EC sets standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of human blood and blood components. The directive aims to ensure high standards of protection for blood donors and recipients while facilitating exchange of blood and blood components between member states where necessary to meet clinical needs.\nSimilarly, Directive 2004/23/EC establishes standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells. The directive covers a wide range of applications from reproductive medicine to bone and skin grafting, establishing requirements for tissue establishments, donor selection, testing protocols, and traceability systems. Directive 2010/53/EU extends similar frameworks to organ transplantation, establishing quality and safety standards for organs intended for transplantation.\nThese directives reflect the recognition that substances of human origin present unique regulatory challenges, combining medical device and pharmaceutical characteristics with ethical considerations specific to human-derived materials. The EU framework aims to ensure safety and quality while respecting principles such as voluntary unpaid donation, anonymity of donors and recipients, and solidarity in the allocation of scarce organs.\n\n\nTobacco Control\nTobacco control represents an area where the EU has pursued relatively ambitious regulatory action, justified by the overwhelming evidence of tobacco’s health harms and the cross-border nature of tobacco marketing and trade. The Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU establishes comprehensive requirements for tobacco products marketed in the EU.\nThe directive mandates that health warnings cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette packages, establishes standardized formats for warning messages, and requires graphic warnings depicting health consequences of smoking. The directive prohibits misleading descriptors such as “light” or “mild” and restricts characterizing flavors that make tobacco products more attractive, particularly to young people. The directive also establishes regulatory frameworks for electronic cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations, safety and quality requirements, and restrictions on advertising.\nMember states have implemented the directive’s minimum standards while some have adopted more stringent measures permitted under EU law, including plain packaging requirements and display bans at point of sale. The EU framework on tobacco control demonstrates how public health considerations can justify significant regulatory intervention in a commercial sector, though always within the bounds of treaty provisions and subject to scrutiny regarding proportionality and evidence basis.\n\n\nHealth Data Protection\nThe protection of health data is governed primarily by the General Data Protection Regulation, which applies across all sectors but includes specific provisions for health data as a special category of personal data requiring additional safeguards. Health data is defined broadly to include information about physical or mental health, including the provision of healthcare services, that reveals information about health status.\nProcessing of health data is generally prohibited unless specific conditions are met, including explicit consent, necessity for healthcare provision, public health purposes, research under appropriate safeguards, or other specified legal grounds. The regulation imposes stringent requirements for data security, transparency about data use, rights for data subjects to access and control their information, and accountability mechanisms including data protection impact assessments for high-risk processing activities.\nThe GDPR framework reflects the need to balance health data protection with legitimate uses of health information for healthcare delivery, research, public health surveillance, and health system management. The regulation provides flexibility for member states to adopt more specific provisions for health data processing while establishing a common floor of protection across the EU. As health systems become increasingly digital and data-driven, the GDPR framework plays an increasingly central role in shaping how health information can be collected, used, and shared."

    "section": "Institutional Architecture for EU Health Policy",
    "text": "Institutional Architecture for EU Health Policy\n\nThe European Commission and DG SANTE\nThe European Commission serves as the executive branch of the European Union, with responsibilities including proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding EU treaties, and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Within the Commission, the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, known as DG SANTE, is responsible for EU policy on food safety, health, and animal welfare.\nDG SANTE develops and implements policies to ensure that food in the EU is safe, that outbreaks of animal and plant diseases are prevented and controlled, that high standards of human health protection are maintained in all EU policies, and that EU citizens can take informed decisions about their health. The directorate-general is organized into directorates covering public health, health systems and products, crisis management and preparedness in health, and food and veterinary matters. The structure reflects the breadth of health-related issues falling within EU competence, from pharmaceutical regulation to disease prevention to food safety.\nThe Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, a member of the College of Commissioners appointed by the European Council and approved by the European Parliament, provides political leadership for EU health policy. The Commissioner proposes new legislation, represents the Commission in health matters, and works with the Council and Parliament in the legislative process. The political priorities of successive Commissioners shape the EU health agenda, though always within the legal constraints of the treaties and subject to the agreement of member states through the Council.\n\n\nThe European Parliament\nThe European Parliament, directly elected by EU citizens every five years, serves as the co-legislative authority for most EU health legislation alongside the Council. The Parliament’s Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, known as ENVI, is the parliamentary committee with primary responsibility for health matters. ENVI examines legislative proposals in the health field, drafts reports with proposed amendments, holds hearings with experts and stakeholders, and votes on whether to recommend adoption of legislation to the full Parliament.\nThe Parliament has gradually expanded its role in health policy as successive treaty reforms have extended the co-decision procedure to more policy areas. Under the ordinary legislative procedure now applied to most health legislation, the Parliament and Council must agree on identical texts for legislation to be adopted. This gives the Parliament significant influence over the content and direction of EU health policy, though always within the framework of Commission proposals and in negotiation with member states through the Council.\nMembers of the European Parliament from different member states and political groups bring diverse perspectives to health policy debates. While the Parliament generally supports ambitious health initiatives and often pushes for stronger provisions than proposed by the Commission or sought by the Council, MEPs must also be attentive to concerns about subsidiarity and national competences. The Parliament’s health deliberations thus reflect tensions between the desire for stronger EU action on health and respect for the primacy of national health systems.\n\n\nThe Council of the European Union\nThe Council of the European Union, representing member state governments, is the co-legislative authority alongside the Parliament for most EU health legislation. Health matters are addressed primarily by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, known as EPSCO, which brings together ministers responsible for employment, social protection, consumer affairs, health, and equality from all member states.\nThe EPSCO Council examines legislative proposals, agrees on the Council’s position through negotiations in working parties and COREPER (the Committee of Permanent Representatives), and participates in trialogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission to reach final agreement on legislation. The Council also adopts conclusions on health policy issues, providing political guidance on priorities and approaches. While conclusions are not legally binding, they reflect agreements among member states and influence the development of EU health policy.\nThe Council Working Party on Public Health, composed of national health ministry officials, conducts detailed examination of health policy proposals and prepares the ground for EPSCO discussions. The working party provides a forum for member states to discuss health policy issues, share national experiences, and identify common positions. The technical expertise of working party members, combined with their understanding of national contexts, shapes the practical implementation of EU health initiatives.\nDecision-making in the Council on health matters generally uses qualified majority voting, meaning that proposals can be adopted without unanimous support if they receive support from member states representing at least 55% of member states and 65% of the EU population. However, particularly sensitive health issues may require consensus, and member states that object strongly to particular provisions can seek to protect national interests. The Council thus serves both as a forum for cooperation and as a guardian of member state prerogatives in health policy.\n\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency\nThe European Medicines Agency, established in 1995 and currently based in Amsterdam, is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision, and safety monitoring of medicines in the European Union. The agency coordinates a network of national medicines regulatory authorities, facilitating collaboration and harmonization while benefiting from diverse scientific expertise across member states.\nEMA’s core responsibilities include evaluating applications for marketing authorization through the centralized procedure, providing scientific opinions on medicines, monitoring the safety of medicines through pharmacovigilance activities, providing scientific advice to medicine developers, and publishing information about medicines for healthcare professionals and patients. The agency operates through scientific committees that assess medicines based on quality, safety, and efficacy data provided by applicants.\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use evaluates medicines for human use, while the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee assesses safety issues, and the Committee for Advanced Therapies evaluates novel therapies based on genes, tissues, or cells. Additional committees address orphan medicines, pediatric medicines, and herbal medicinal products. These committees comprise experts nominated by member states, ensuring that authorization decisions benefit from the best available scientific expertise across Europe.\nEMA’s role extends beyond initial authorization to include monitoring medicines throughout their lifecycle. Post-authorization safety monitoring through the European pharmacovigilance system collects and analyzes adverse reaction reports from healthcare professionals, patients, and pharmaceutical companies. When new safety concerns arise, EMA can require label changes, impose restrictions on use, or in serious cases recommend suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization. This comprehensive approach to medicine regulation aims to ensure that medicines available in Europe meet consistently high standards.\nThe agency also plays an important role in facilitating access to medicines. Scientific advice programs provide guidance to developers on clinical trial design and data requirements, potentially accelerating development of promising therapies. Accelerated assessment procedures allow faster evaluation of medicines addressing unmet medical needs, while conditional authorizations enable early access to promising medicines when comprehensive data are not yet available. These mechanisms reflect efforts to balance rapid access to innovation with maintenance of high safety and efficacy standards.\n\n\nEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, established in 2005 and based in Stockholm, serves as the EU’s specialized agency for communicable disease prevention and control. ECDC strengthens Europe’s defenses against infectious diseases by providing scientific advice, surveillance and monitoring, epidemic intelligence, and support for preparedness and response planning.\nECDC operates the European Surveillance System, known as TESSy, which collects surveillance data on communicable diseases from member states using standardized case definitions and data formats. This harmonized surveillance enables identification of trends, detection of outbreaks, and monitoring of disease burden across Europe. ECDC publishes regular surveillance reports, outbreak investigations, and risk assessments that inform public health decision-making in member states and at EU level.\nThe centre’s epidemic intelligence activities combine surveillance data with information from multiple sources to detect and assess public health threats as early as possible. This includes monitoring media reports, analyzing airline passenger data during disease outbreaks, and maintaining networks of specialists who can rapidly provide expertise on emerging threats. During outbreaks, ECDC can deploy rapid assistance teams to support affected member states with field epidemiology, laboratory investigation, and control measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to significant expansion of ECDC’s mandate and resources. Regulations adopted in 2022 enhanced ECDC’s capacity to coordinate surveillance, strengthened its role in preparedness planning including reviews of national preparedness plans, and provided authority to activate the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan during emergencies. These changes reflect recognition that stronger central scientific capacity is needed to support coordinated responses to major health threats while respecting member state authority over public health measures.\nECDC also supports training of public health professionals through the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, which provides practical training in outbreak investigation and applied epidemiology. This fellowship program helps build capacity across Europe while creating networks of professionals who can collaborate effectively during cross-border health threats. The centre additionally provides guidance on prevention measures, publishes technical documents on disease-specific topics, and conducts research on emerging public health challenges.\n\n\nHealth Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority\nThe Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, known as HERA, was established in 2021 as part of the EU response to lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike traditional EU agencies, HERA is established within the European Commission structure but operates with significant autonomy and dedicated resources for health emergency preparedness and response.\nHERA’s mandate encompasses the full cycle of health emergency management from prevention and preparedness through response and recovery. In preparedness mode, which represents its normal operating state, HERA conducts threat assessments, gathers intelligence on potential health threats, supports research and development of medical countermeasures, addresses potential supply chain vulnerabilities, and maintains strategic stockpiles of critical medical supplies. The authority works with member states, EU agencies, industry, and international partners to strengthen Europe’s collective preparedness for health emergencies.\nA key innovation of HERA is its focus on medical countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and personal protective equipment. HERA aims to avoid the supply shortages, competition between member states, and dependence on external suppliers that characterized early pandemic response. The authority facilitates advance purchase agreements with manufacturers to secure supplies, supports development of novel countermeasures through research funding, and works to maintain European manufacturing capacity for critical medical products through the EU FAB network concept.\nWhen the Commission activates emergency mode in response to a recognized health crisis, HERA shifts to emergency operations with enhanced authority and resources. In emergency mode, HERA can trigger rapid procurement procedures, activate emergency medical countermeasure development, coordinate distribution of supplies, and mobilize additional financing. This dual-mode structure aims to ensure sustained attention to preparedness while enabling rapid response when emergencies occur.\nHERA’s establishment represents a significant evolution in EU health policy, moving beyond purely coordinating functions to include operational capacity for ensuring medical supply security. This reflects recognition that effective pandemic preparedness requires not only coordination but also concrete measures to maintain manufacturing capacity, secure supplies, and support innovation. The authority’s success will depend on sustained political and financial commitment beyond the immediate post-pandemic period.\n\n\nOther Relevant Agencies\nThe European Food Safety Authority, based in Parma, provides independent scientific advice and communication on risks associated with the food chain. EFSA conducts risk assessments on food safety issues ranging from additives and contaminants to zoonotic diseases and nutrition. While EFSA does not make regulatory decisions, its scientific opinions inform legislation and guidance on food safety matters. The authority’s work links closely to health protection, addressing issues such as foodborne pathogens, chemical contaminants in food, and nutritional aspects of public health.\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, located in Lisbon, serves as the EU reference point for information on drugs and drug addiction. EMCDDA monitors the drug situation in Europe, collecting and analyzing data on drug use, consequences, and responses. The centre publishes annual reports on the state of the drug problem in Europe, threat assessments on new psychoactive substances, and guidance on prevention and harm reduction approaches. While member states retain primary responsibility for drug policies, EMCDDA facilitates evidence-informed policymaking and cooperation.\nThe European Health and Digital Executive Agency, established through merger of previous executive agencies, implements EU health programs including EU4Health. As an executive agency, HaDEA is responsible for managing calls for proposals, evaluating applications, signing grant agreements, monitoring project implementation, and ensuring effective use of EU health funding. The agency serves as the operational arm for implementing Commission health policies, enabling the Commission services to focus on policy development while specialized staff manage program implementation."

    "section": "EU4Health Programme: The Current Framework (2021-2027)",
    "text": "EU4Health Programme: The Current Framework (2021-2027)\n\nGenesis and Objectives\nThe EU4Health programme, formally established by Regulation 2021/522, represents the most ambitious EU health programme to date both in terms of budget and scope. With €5.3 billion allocated for 2021-2027, EU4Health commands resources more than tenfold greater than the previous health programme. This dramatic increase reflects the political momentum generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed vulnerabilities in health systems and prompted recognition that stronger EU-level capacity is needed to address cross-border health challenges.\nThe programme emerged from the Commission’s proposal in May 2020 for a €9.4 billion health programme as part of the recovery from COVID-19. After negotiations between the Parliament, Council, and Commission, the final budget was set at €5.3 billion, still representing unprecedented investment in EU health activities. The increase reflects both the urgent need to strengthen health security following pandemic experiences and political will to develop a stronger health dimension to European integration.\nEU4Health establishes four general objectives that structure all programme activities. First, protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination between member states to address such threats. Second, improving the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices, and other crisis-relevant products and contributing to their accessibility and affordability. Third, strengthening health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency, including through supporting digital transformation, integrated work between care sectors, primary care, disease prevention, and health promotion. Fourth, contributing to protecting people from serious cross-border threats to health and supporting actions in third countries and international health organizations.\n\n\nCrisis Preparedness and Response\nThe first pillar of EU4Health addresses strengthening crisis preparedness, surveillance, early detection, and response capacity. Actions funded under this pillar include building stockpiles of medical countermeasures, expanding production capacity for crisis-relevant products, supporting surveillance and early warning systems, developing and testing preparedness and response plans, and building capacity for coordination during health crises.\nSpecific initiatives include support for the rescEU medical reserve, which maintains stockpiles of medical equipment including ventilators, personal protective equipment, laboratory supplies, and therapeutics that can be rapidly deployed to member states during emergencies. The programme funds advance purchase agreements for medical countermeasures, ensuring that vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics can be procured rapidly when threats emerge. Support for the EU FAB initiative aims to maintain European manufacturing capacity for essential medical products, reducing dependence on external suppliers demonstrated to be problematic during the pandemic.\nThe programme strengthens surveillance capacity through support for the European Surveillance System and other monitoring networks coordinated by ECDC. Enhanced surveillance includes genomic sequencing capacity for pathogen characterization, environmental surveillance for early detection of biological threats, and integrated surveillance approaches linking human, animal, and environmental health data consistent with One Health principles.\nPreparedness planning receives support through assessment and testing of national and EU-level preparedness plans, development of response protocols, and exercises that test coordination mechanisms. The programme funds capacity building for surge capacity in healthcare systems, including training of healthcare workers in emergency response, development of mobile medical teams, and planning for rapid expansion of hospital capacity during crises.\n\n\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion\nEU4Health supports actions across the spectrum of disease prevention and health promotion, addressing both communicable and non-communicable diseases. For communicable diseases, the programme funds vaccination initiatives including campaigns to improve coverage, combat vaccine hesitancy, and introduce new vaccines. Support for antimicrobial resistance initiatives includes stewardship programs, infection prevention and control, surveillance, and research on novel approaches to bacterial infections.\nNon-communicable disease prevention receives substantial support, particularly implementation of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. Funded actions include support for population-based cancer screening programs, smoking cessation services, nutrition and physical activity promotion, and reduction of environmental carcinogens. Mental health initiatives funded include services for vulnerable populations, integration of mental health into primary care, workplace mental health programs, and suicide prevention efforts.\nThe programme supports health promotion across the life course, from maternal and child health through healthy aging. Actions address health literacy, empowering people to make informed decisions about their health, health promotion in schools and workplaces, and community-based interventions addressing social determinants of health. The programme also funds health equity initiatives aimed at reducing disparities between and within member states.\nImplementation of the Healthier Together initiative receives EU4Health support, facilitating member state cooperation on cardiovascular health, diabetes, mental health, and health determinants. The programme funds joint actions bringing together multiple member states to implement best practices, pilot innovative approaches, and share lessons learned. This cooperative approach respects national competences while facilitating learning and adoption of effective interventions.\n\n\nHealth Systems Strengthening\nStrengthening health systems represents a major focus of EU4Health, addressing structural challenges including workforce shortages, digital transformation needs, integration of care across sectors, and quality improvement. The programme funds initiatives to support primary care development, recognizing that strong primary care systems improve outcomes while controlling costs. Support includes training for primary care professionals, development of integrated care models, and implementation of digital tools supporting primary care delivery.\nDigital transformation receives substantial investment, including support for electronic health record systems, telemedicine infrastructure, artificial intelligence applications in healthcare, and digital tools for patient engagement and self-management. The programme funds development of interoperability standards enabling exchange of health information across borders and between systems. Cybersecurity for health systems also receives attention given increasing digitalization and emerging threats.\nHealth workforce initiatives address recruitment, retention, and training of healthcare professionals. The programme supports development of innovative training programs, continuing professional development, exchanges that facilitate learning across member states, and initiatives to improve working conditions and prevent burnout. Particular attention addresses shortages of specific professions including nurses, pharmacists, and mental health professionals.\nQuality and patient safety initiatives funded include implementation of clinical guidelines, patient safety protocols, quality indicators for health systems, and mechanisms for learning from adverse events. The programme supports accreditation systems, quality improvement collaboratives, and research on effective quality improvement strategies. Patient engagement and empowerment receive support through initiatives promoting shared decision-making, patient-reported outcome measures, and patient involvement in quality improvement.\n\n\nMedicines and Medical Devices\nEU4Health addresses challenges related to availability, accessibility, and affordability of medicines and medical devices. Medicine shortages receive particular attention through support for monitoring systems, diversification of supply chains, and incentives for production of critical medicines at risk of shortage. The programme funds research on causes of shortages and pilot initiatives testing solutions such as buffer stocks, contractual requirements for continuity of supply, and incentives for production of less profitable but medically important medicines.\nSupporting innovative medicines and devices includes funding for regulatory science, facilitating clinical trials, and supporting health technology assessment to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions. The programme funds development of real-world evidence generating systems that provide information on medicines performance in routine practice. Support for orphan medicines development and medicines for pediatric use addresses market failures in these areas.\nRational use of medicines is promoted through prescribing guidelines, pharmacist-led medicines review services, and patient education about appropriate use of medicines. Antimicrobial stewardship receives particular emphasis given the AMR challenge. The programme also supports environmentally sustainable pharmaceutical production and use, addressing pollution from pharmaceutical manufacturing and disposal.\nMedical devices initiatives address safety monitoring, support for innovative devices, and facilitating small and medium enterprise access to regulatory processes. The programme funds post-market surveillance systems, training for notified bodies, and development of standards supporting device safety and performance. Patient registries for implantable devices enable long-term monitoring of device performance and early detection of safety issues.\n\n\nImplementation Mechanisms\nEU4Health is implemented through various mechanisms tailored to different types of actions and objectives. Direct grants to member states support implementation of priority actions including strengthening health systems, expanding screening programs, implementing disease prevention initiatives, and building crisis preparedness capacity. Direct grants are also awarded to international organizations, particularly WHO, for global health initiatives.\nJoint actions represent a distinctive EU4Health mechanism, bringing together multiple member states to implement collaborative projects. Joint actions typically address issues requiring coordinated approaches across countries, such as cross-border health threat preparedness, health workforce planning, or implementation of health technology assessment cooperation. By pooling resources and expertise, joint actions enable member states to achieve objectives that would be difficult to accomplish individually.\nPublic procurement under EU4Health addresses acquisition of medical countermeasures, vaccines, and other health products for crisis response or disease prevention. Joint procurement enables member states to negotiate better prices through collective purchasing power while ensuring smaller member states have access to products they might struggle to obtain independently. Advanced purchase agreements provide guaranteed markets for manufacturers, reducing risk of investment in production capacity.\nOperating grants support organizations contributing to EU4Health objectives, including non-governmental organizations working on health issues, professional associations, patient organizations, and research networks. Operating grants provide core funding supporting organizational capacity, enabling these bodies to engage in EU health policy processes and implement projects aligned with programme priorities.\nPrizes and procurement of services represent additional implementation tools. Prizes incentivize innovation by awarding financial rewards for achievements such as developing novel diagnostic tools, implementing innovative care models, or creating effective health promotion campaigns. Procurement of services enables the programme to contract for technical expertise, studies, or services supporting programme implementation."

    "title": "European Union Health Collaboration",
    "section": "Future Directions in EU Health Policy",
    "text": "Future Directions in EU Health Policy\n\nThe Evolving European Health Union\nThe concept of a European Health Union, articulated by Commission President von der Leyen in 2020, represents an aspiration for deeper health integration while respecting the fundamental principle that health systems remain national competences. The Health Union concept encompasses several dimensions including enhanced capacity for health emergency preparedness and response, stronger EU agencies with clearer mandates, more systematic cooperation on health challenges transcending borders, and greater investment in health innovation and research.\nThe practical development of the Health Union proceeds through incremental steps rather than dramatic treaty changes. Strengthened mandates for ECDC and EMA, the establishment of HERA, increased budgets for health programs, and new legislative proposals on issues such as health data and pharmaceutical regulation all contribute to building the Health Union in practice. However, tensions persist between ambitions for stronger EU health capacity and concerns about preserving national autonomy in healthcare decisions.\nFuture evolution of the Health Union may include further strengthening of emergency response mechanisms, potentially including binding EU decisions during serious cross-border health crises. Some envision development of EU health system benchmarking and performance assessment, though this raises sensitivity about implicit comparisons and potential pressure on healthcare organization. Enhanced financing mechanisms for health, potentially including EU health bonds or expanded health budgets, could provide resources for more ambitious initiatives. However, all such developments must navigate the tension between perceived need for stronger EU action and member state insistence on preserving national competences.\n\n\nEuropean Health Data Space\nThe European Health Data Space represents one of the most significant upcoming developments in EU health policy. The proposed regulation, published in 2022 and under legislative negotiation as of 2025, aims to create a comprehensive framework for health data use supporting both healthcare delivery and research while ensuring robust data protection.\nThe EHDS distinguishes between primary use of health data for healthcare provision and secondary use for research, innovation, policymaking, and regulatory purposes. For primary use, the regulation would establish rights for individuals to access and control their electronic health records, requirements for health data interoperability enabling records to be shared across borders, and frameworks for electronic prescriptions and patient summaries that work throughout the EU. These provisions aim to support patient mobility, enable cross-border healthcare, and improve care coordination.\nSecondary use provisions establish frameworks for researchers, innovators, policymakers, and regulators to access health data in privacy-preserving ways. Health data access bodies in each member state would provide secure access to health datasets for approved uses, applying consistent criteria for access and implementing technical and organizational safeguards. A permit system would authorize data users, and a catalogue would enable discovery of available datasets across the EU.\nThe EHDS proposal addresses multiple challenges. Interoperability standards would enable different health information systems to exchange data effectively, overcoming current fragmentation where health data is locked in incompatible systems. Data quality requirements would ensure that data used for secondary purposes meets standards for completeness, accuracy, and documentation. Governance frameworks would balance access for legitimate uses against privacy protection, preventing unauthorized use or breaches.\nImplementation of the EHDS will require substantial technical, organizational, and cultural changes. Health information systems must adopt common standards and incorporate interfaces enabling data portability. Health data access bodies must be established with appropriate expertise and resources. Healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers must adapt to new frameworks for data access and use. Most fundamentally, trust must be built that health data will be used responsibly, with benefits flowing back to individuals and society while risks of misuse or privacy violations are mitigated.\nThe timeline for EHDS implementation anticipates adoption of the regulation in 2024-2025, with gradual implementation over several years as technical standards are developed, national infrastructures are built, and stakeholders adapt to new requirements. The EHDS represents an ambitious vision of health data as a resource supporting better healthcare and research while respecting individual rights and privacy.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Legislative Reform\nComprehensive reform of EU pharmaceutical legislation is underway, with proposals published in 2023 currently under legislative consideration. The reform addresses multiple objectives that sometimes tension with each other including ensuring availability of medicines across the EU, supporting innovation particularly for unmet medical needs, reducing regulatory burden, addressing medicine shortages, and promoting environmental sustainability.\nKey elements of the proposed reform include revised incentive structures for medicines. Currently, medicines receive regulatory data protection and market exclusivity periods protecting against generic competition. The reform proposes making exclusivity periods conditional, with additional protection awarded for medicines addressing unmet needs, medicines made available in all member states, or medicines for which clinical trials included sufficient diversity of participants. This conditionality aims to incentivize industry behavior aligned with public health priorities.\nAccelerated pathways for medicines addressing high unmet needs would be expanded, potentially including adaptive pathways where initial authorizations based on limited data are confirmed through post-authorization evidence generation. Provisions addressing medicine shortages include requirements for early notification of discontinuations, shortage monitoring obligations, and potentially requirements to maintain supply in all markets where authorization is held.\nRegulatory burden reduction for generic and biosimilar medicines could accelerate entry of lower-cost competitors after patent expiration, improving affordability and access. Streamlined procedures for medicines authorized in comparable regulatory systems could reduce duplication while maintaining high safety standards. However, proposals must balance efficiency with ensuring robust safety and efficacy assessment.\nEnvironmental sustainability provisions would require pharmaceutical companies to assess environmental risks, implement measures minimizing pharmaceutical pollution, and report on sustainability indicators. Given growing evidence of pharmaceutical contamination of water systems and potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems and antimicrobial resistance, integrating environmental considerations into pharmaceutical regulation represents an important evolution.\nThe pharmaceutical reform proposals have generated intense debate among stakeholders. Industry raises concerns about reduced intellectual property protection affecting innovation incentives, while health systems and payers emphasize affordability and access imperatives. Patient organizations seek to ensure that reform does not compromise medicine availability or slow access to innovations. Balancing these competing concerns while maintaining high safety standards represents the central challenge for the ongoing legislative process.\n\n\nCancer Mission and Future Cancer Initiatives\nThe Cancer Mission, part of the Horizon Europe research framework, complements Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan through focused research investment aimed at achieving the goal of saving three million additional lives by 2030. With €1.25 billion dedicated to cancer research over 2021-2027, the mission funds projects addressing prevention, early detection, treatment, and quality of life for cancer patients and survivors.\nMission priorities include understanding cancer biology to identify new therapeutic targets, developing precision medicine approaches matching treatments to individual tumor characteristics, improving early detection through novel screening approaches and technologies, and addressing cancer inequalities. The mission emphasizes translational research bridging from laboratory discoveries to clinical application, recognizing that many scientific advances do not reach patients due to barriers in translation and implementation.\nSpecific initiatives under the cancer mission include development of cancer diagnostic tools enabling earlier and more accurate detection, creation of a European Cancer Imaging Initiative providing training datasets for AI-based diagnostic tools, and research on cancer prevention addressing modifiable risk factors. The mission also funds research on rare cancers where small patient populations impede traditional research approaches, and on childhood cancers where distinct biology requires specialized research efforts.\nLooking beyond the current mission, future cancer initiatives may include expanded screening programs as new technologies enable effective screening for additional cancer types. Immunotherapy approaches continue to evolve, with research on combinations, biomarkers predicting response, and mechanisms of resistance. Cancer survivorship receives growing attention, addressing long-term effects of cancer and treatment, psychosocial support needs, and prevention of recurrence.\nIntegration of cancer care with other health priorities also emerges as important. The intersection of cancer with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health conditions requires coordinated approaches. Addressing cancer disparities between and within countries remains a priority, requiring research on determinants of inequalities and interventions to reduce gaps in outcomes.\n\n\nMental Health Strategy Implementation\nThe comprehensive approach to mental health adopted in 2023 establishes a framework for action over coming years through twenty flagship initiatives. Implementation of this ambitious agenda requires sustained commitment, adequate resources, and coordination across multiple sectors given that mental health is influenced by factors far beyond healthcare.\nKey implementation challenges include integration of mental health into primary care and general healthcare settings, addressing fragmentation that often results in people with mental health needs falling through gaps in services. Training of primary care providers in mental health assessment and basic interventions can improve access while reducing pressure on specialized services. Integration of mental health and physical health care is particularly important given high rates of comorbidity.\nWorkforce development represents a critical need, with shortages of mental health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers in many member states. Expanding training capacity, improving working conditions to enhance retention, and developing new professional roles such as peer support workers and mental health coaches can help address workforce gaps.\nSuicide prevention requires comprehensive approaches including primary prevention addressing risk factors, training of healthcare and other professionals in suicide risk assessment, ensuring access to crisis services, implementing means restriction, and supporting those bereaved by suicide. Evidence-based interventions exist but implementation remains inconsistent across Europe.\nDigital mental health tools offer potential to improve access particularly in areas with provider shortages, but quality assurance is essential. Regulatory frameworks must ensure that apps and online services meet evidence standards, protect user data, and integrate appropriately with traditional services. Questions about reimbursement for digital mental health interventions and their place in treatment pathways require attention.\nAddressing mental health stigma and discrimination remains foundational, as stigma deters help-seeking and contributes to social exclusion of people with mental health conditions. Public campaigns, contact-based interventions bringing people into direct contact with those who have experienced mental health challenges, and anti-discrimination legislation all contribute to stigma reduction.\n\n\nCardiovascular Disease Action\nCardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in Europe, accounting for more deaths than all cancers combined. Despite reductions in cardiovascular mortality over recent decades, CVD burden remains high and disparities persist. An EU cardiovascular disease plan is in development, expected to establish priorities and actions analogous to those in the Beating Cancer Plan.\nAnticipated priorities include prevention of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Population-level interventions addressing social determinants of cardiovascular health, including urban environments, food systems, and economic factors, complement individual-level risk factor management.\nEarly detection and screening for cardiovascular disease receives attention, with consideration of systematic screening for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol in defined populations. Atrial fibrillation screening could prevent strokes through early anticoagulation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in older men demonstrates cost-effectiveness. However, questions persist about optimal screening strategies, age ranges, and integration with existing healthcare services.\nImproving acute cardiovascular care includes ensuring timely access to reperfusion for heart attacks and strokes, as outcomes are highly time-dependent. Networks ensuring rapid transport to centers capable of providing advanced interventions can save lives and reduce disability. Cardiac rehabilitation following heart attacks improves outcomes but remains underutilized, suggesting need for expanded capacity and access.\nChronic disease management for people with established cardiovascular disease aims to prevent complications, optimize quality of life, and reduce healthcare utilization. Integrated care models coordinating across primary and specialist care, including nurses and other professionals in care teams, and using digital tools for monitoring can improve outcomes while controlling costs.\nAddressing cardiovascular inequalities between countries, regions, and population groups requires research on determinants and interventions to reduce gaps. Cardiovascular mortality varies several-fold across Europe, with higher rates in eastern and southeastern Europe. Within countries, cardiovascular risk follows social gradients with higher rates among disadvantaged populations.\n\n\nStrengthening Antimicrobial Resistance Response\nAntimicrobial resistance continues to worsen despite actions to date, indicating need for intensified efforts. A proposed Council Recommendation on strengthening EU action against AMR through a One Health approach, published in 2023, aims to enhance coordination and ambition across member states.\nThe recommendation proposes national targets for reduction of antimicrobial consumption in human and veterinary medicine, recognizing that reduced consumption slows resistance development. Targets would be differentiated based on current consumption levels, with high-consuming countries expected to achieve larger reductions. Implementation of targets requires monitoring systems tracking consumption, stewardship programs promoting appropriate use, and policy measures such as restrictions on antibiotic prescribing and use.\nInfection prevention and control receives emphasis as a means to reduce need for antimicrobials by preventing infections. Healthcare-associated infections represent a significant source of antibiotic-resistant infections. Strengthening IPC programs, ensuring adequate staffing and resources, implementing evidence-based practices, and monitoring IPC performance can reduce infection rates and consequently antimicrobial use.\nThe pull incentive question for new antimicrobials remains contested. Without new mechanisms, market failure will persist as the commercial returns on antimicrobials do not justify development costs, particularly given that new antibiotics should be reserved for resistant infections. Proposed approaches include subscription models where health systems pay fixed fees for access to antibiotics regardless of volumes used, transferable exclusivity vouchers providing market exclusivity for other products as reward for antibiotic development, and direct grants supporting clinical development.\nEnvironmental dimensions of AMR receive growing attention, as antimicrobial contamination of water systems from pharmaceutical manufacturing and agriculture contributes to resistance development. Standards for wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturing, regulations on veterinary antimicrobial use, and treatment of agricultural runoff can reduce environmental antimicrobial concentrations.\nInternational cooperation remains essential given that AMR spreads globally. The EU supports capacity building in partner countries for surveillance, laboratory capacity, stewardship programs, and infection control. Global governance mechanisms through WHO, FAO, and OIE provide frameworks for coordinated action. Access to antibiotics in low-income countries must be balanced against stewardship imperatives, requiring nuanced approaches that ensure access to essential antibiotics while promoting appropriate use.\n\n\nHealth Workforce Initiative\nDemographic changes, increasing complexity of care needs, high burnout rates, and uneven distribution of healthcare professionals make health workforce sustainability a priority concern. A comprehensive EU health workforce initiative is under development to support member states in addressing these challenges while respecting their competence over healthcare organization.\nPriority areas include workforce planning and forecasting, improving data on current and projected healthcare workforce needs considering demographic trends, technological changes, and evolving models of care. Better forecasting enables proactive training adjustments, reducing cycles of shortage and oversupply. Cooperation on workforce planning can help anticipate cross-border movements of healthcare professionals.\nTraining and education initiatives address both quantity and quality of healthcare workforce preparation. Expanding training capacity where shortages persist, ensuring curricula prepare professionals for evolving practice including digital health competencies, and developing continuing education systems maintaining competence throughout careers all require attention. Interprofessional education preparing professionals to work effectively in teams can improve care coordination.\nRetention of healthcare professionals requires addressing working conditions contributing to burnout and attrition. High workloads, inadequate staffing, difficult working conditions, lack of professional development opportunities, and insufficient recognition all contribute to healthcare professionals leaving the profession or migrating to other countries. Improving working conditions, ensuring adequate compensation, providing professional development, and creating supportive work environments can enhance retention.\nEthical recruitment practices are essential given that many EU member states recruit healthcare professionals from third countries. WHO Global Code of Practice on International Recruitment of Health Personnel establishes principles for ethical recruitment, including discouraging active recruitment from countries with critical shortages, ensuring transparent employment contracts, and supporting source countries in building their health workforce capacity.\nDeployment of healthcare professionals during emergencies, highlighted by COVID-19, requires mechanisms for rapid mobilization, clear legal frameworks for cross-border deployment, and systems supporting deployed professionals. The European Medical Corps and similar mechanisms provide frameworks, but expansion and strengthening could enhance capacity for future crises.\n\n\nClimate Change and Health\nClimate change represents a growing threat to health through multiple pathways including extreme heat events, changing patterns of vector-borne diseases, air pollution, impacts on food and water security, and climate-related migration and conflict. An integrated approach to climate and health is emerging as a priority for EU health policy.\nHeat-health action plans represent an immediate adaptation priority, as extreme heat events are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration. Effective plans include early warning systems triggering protective actions when dangerous heat is forecast, guidance for vulnerable populations, cool spaces where people can escape heat, and monitoring of heat-related morbidity and mortality. Urban planning incorporating green space and water features can reduce urban heat island effects.\nVector-borne diseases including those transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks may expand their geographic range as climate change shifts species distributions. Enhanced surveillance for vectors and diseases, control programs targeting vector populations, and clinical capacity to recognize and treat vector-borne diseases can mitigate risks. Invasive mosquito species already established in southern Europe could spread northward with climate warming.\nAir pollution, closely linked to climate change through shared sources in fossil fuel combustion, causes significant mortality and morbidity. Policies reducing greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously improve air quality and health. EU air quality standards set limits on pollutants, though evidence suggests that health effects occur at levels below current standards, suggesting need for stricter standards over time.\nClimate resilience of health systems requires attention to both physical infrastructure and operational preparedness. Healthcare facilities must be able to maintain operations during extreme weather events, which may require backup power, water storage, structural resilience to flooding or storms, and cool facilities during heat waves. Supply chains for medicines and medical supplies require redundancy given vulnerability to climate impacts on production and transport.\nThe health co-benefits of climate action represent an important framing, as policies to mitigate climate change often yield immediate health benefits. Active transport infrastructure promoting walking and cycling reduces both emissions and chronic diseases. Plant-rich diets have lower environmental impact while reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Energy-efficient housing reduces both emissions and respiratory disease from indoor air pollution. Emphasizing health co-benefits can strengthen political support for climate action.\n\n\nDigital Health Transformation\nDigital technologies offer potential to transform healthcare delivery, but realizing this potential while avoiding harms requires thoughtful governance. Beyond the European Health Data Space, multiple digital health initiatives advance.\nArtificial intelligence applications in healthcare span diagnosis support, treatment planning, drug discovery, and health system management. AI diagnostic tools for radiology, pathology, and other specialties show promise for improving accuracy and efficiency. Treatment recommendation systems can support clinical decision-making by synthesizing evidence and patient-specific factors. However, AI also raises concerns about algorithmic bias, lack of transparency in decision-making, unclear liability when AI contributes to adverse outcomes, and potential deskilling of healthcare professionals.\nRegulation of AI in healthcare is addressed through the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which classifies most healthcare AI as high-risk requiring conformity assessment before market introduction. Requirements include data quality standards, transparency and explainability, human oversight, and robustness. Healthcare-specific AI guidance may provide additional detail on appropriate development, validation, and deployment of AI in clinical settings.\nTelemedicine expanded dramatically during COVID-19 and much of this expansion is likely to persist. Telemedicine offers convenience for patients, improves access in underserved areas, and can reduce healthcare costs. However, telemedicine also raises questions about quality of care when physical examination is not possible, data protection for consultations conducted remotely, and reimbursement policies. Ensuring telemedicine complements rather than replaces in-person care where the latter is clinically indicated remains important.\nRemote patient monitoring using wearables and sensors enables continuous monitoring of chronic conditions, potentially enabling earlier intervention and reducing hospitalizations. Digital therapeutics providing evidence-based interventions through apps or software are emerging for conditions including mental health disorders, diabetes, and substance use. However, evidence standards for digital health interventions, reimbursement frameworks, and integration with traditional care all require development.\nCybersecurity for health systems is increasingly critical as digitalization creates new vulnerabilities. Ransomware attacks on healthcare facilities disrupt care delivery and compromise patient data. Medical devices connected to networks may be vulnerable to hacking with potentially life-threatening consequences. Building cybersecurity capacity, implementing security standards, and planning for cyber incidents all require attention and resources.\nDigital inclusion must be considered to ensure that digital transformation does not widen health inequalities. Older adults, people with disabilities, those with limited digital literacy, and populations with poor internet access risk being left behind by digital health. Maintaining non-digital alternatives, designing inclusive digital interfaces, and providing support for digital health use can promote equity."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe evolution of European Union health collaboration from modest beginnings in occupational health provisions to the current ambitious Health Union agenda reflects both the functional needs created by European integration and political choices about the appropriate scope of EU action. The principle of subsidiarity ensures that health systems remain fundamentally national competences shaped by distinct traditions, financing mechanisms, and political choices. Yet the cross-border nature of many health threats, the benefits of coordinating action on issues of common interest, and the potential to learn from diverse national approaches justify significant EU involvement in health matters.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for expansion of EU health activities, exposing gaps in preparedness and coordination while demonstrating both the necessity and possibility of enhanced EU-level action. The establishment of HERA, strengthening of ECDC, massive increase in health funding through EU4Health, and ambitious initiatives such as the Beating Cancer Plan reflect lessons learned and political momentum for stronger health collaboration.\nLooking forward, multiple trends are likely to shape EU health policy. Demographic aging will increase demands on health systems while constraining resources through workforce aging and fiscal pressures. Climate change will increasingly affect health through multiple pathways requiring adaptation and underlining co-benefits of climate mitigation. Digital transformation offers potential for improved efficiency and quality but raises challenges around data protection, algorithmic bias, and digital inclusion. Antimicrobial resistance threatens to undermine medical advances dependent on effective antibiotics. Mental health emerges as a growing concern, particularly among young people. These challenges transcend national borders and benefit from coordinated responses.\nThe tension between ambitions for stronger EU health capacity and insistence on preserving national autonomy in healthcare decisions will persist. This tension is not necessarily negative, as it ensures that expansion of EU competence requires justification demonstrating added value and respects principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The EU’s value in health lies not in replacing national health systems but in addressing genuinely cross-border issues, facilitating cooperation and learning, providing technical expertise and coordination capacity, and mobilizing resources for common priorities.\nThe coming years will test whether the post-pandemic momentum for EU health collaboration can be sustained as memories of COVID-19 fade and budgetary pressures mount. Continued evolution toward a European Health Union capable of effectively addressing cross-border health challenges while respecting national competences requires not only adequate funding and clear governance structures but also trust among member states and between EU institutions and member states. Building and maintaining this trust through transparent operation, demonstrated effectiveness, and respect for legitimate differences in national approaches remains the fundamental challenge and opportunity for EU health collaboration."

    "title": "International Health Collaboration: The World Health Organization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe World Health Organization stands as the preeminent international institution dedicated to the advancement of health and wellbeing for all humanity. Established in the aftermath of the Second World War during a period of unprecedented international cooperation and institution-building, the WHO emerged from a recognition that health challenges transcend national boundaries and that coordinated global action remains essential for addressing the fundamental determinants of disease and promoting universal health security. Since its inception, the organization has evolved from a modest coordinating body into a complex multilateral institution that shapes health policy, coordinates responses to disease outbreaks, establishes normative standards, and provides technical assistance to nations across all stages of economic development.\nUnderstanding the WHO’s role in contemporary global health requires examination of its historical foundations, organizational architecture, programmatic initiatives, and the evolving challenges it faces in an increasingly interconnected yet politically fragmented world. The organization operates at the intersection of scientific expertise, diplomatic negotiation, and practical implementation, attempting to balance the sometimes competing demands of sovereign nations while pursuing the universal goal of health for all people. This article explores the multifaceted nature of the WHO, examining how its structure enables its functions, how its programs address both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and how it has adapted to meet emerging health challenges in the twenty-first century.\n\n\nHistorical Foundations and Development\nThe origins of international health cooperation predate the WHO by more than a century. The first International Sanitary Conference convened in Paris in 1851, bringing together twelve European nations to address cholera epidemics that repeatedly swept across continents through expanding trade routes. These early conferences, though often hampered by competing national interests and limited scientific understanding of disease transmission, established the principle that epidemic diseases required coordinated international responses. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed the establishment of several regional and international health organizations, including the Pan American Sanitary Bureau in 1902, which later became the Pan American Health Organization, and the Office International d’Hygiène Publique established in Paris in 1907.\nThe League of Nations, founded after the First World War, created its Health Organization in 1923, marking a significant advance in international health cooperation. The League’s Health Organization conducted pioneering work in standardizing biological products, establishing health intelligence systems, and providing technical assistance to member states. Despite the League’s ultimate political failure and the outbreak of the Second World War, its Health Organization demonstrated the value of sustained international collaboration on health matters and provided organizational models that would influence the WHO’s later structure.\nThe founding of the United Nations in 1945 created momentum for establishing a comprehensive international health organization. During the United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco, delegates from Brazil and China proposed creating a new autonomous international health organization. The subsequent International Health Conference, convened in New York in 1946, drafted the WHO Constitution, which was signed by representatives of sixty-one countries. The Constitution’s preamble contained an expansive definition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,” reflecting post-war optimism about the possibility of achieving universal wellbeing through international cooperation and scientific advancement.\nThe WHO officially came into existence on April 7, 1948, when twenty-six member states ratified its Constitution. This date is now commemorated annually as World Health Day. The organization absorbed the functions and assets of the League of Nations Health Organization and the Office International d’Hygiène Publique, providing continuity with earlier international health efforts while establishing a broader mandate and more robust institutional framework. The WHO’s early headquarters in Geneva symbolically positioned the organization in neutral Switzerland, emphasizing its role as an impartial technical agency serving all nations regardless of political alignment during the emerging Cold War.\nThe organization’s first major triumph came through the global smallpox eradication campaign, which commenced in 1967 under the leadership of American epidemiologist D.A. Henderson. The campaign demonstrated the potential for coordinated international action to eliminate disease through systematic vaccination, surveillance, and containment strategies. The last naturally occurring case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia in 1977, and the World Health Assembly certified global eradication in 1980. This achievement stands as one of humanity’s greatest public health accomplishments and validated the WHO’s role as coordinator of global health initiatives. The smallpox campaign also generated important lessons about disease surveillance, laboratory networks, and the challenges of maintaining program momentum across diverse political and geographic contexts.\nFollowing the smallpox success, the WHO launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974, aiming to ensure universal access to vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and tuberculosis. This program significantly increased global vaccination coverage, though achieving universal immunization proved more challenging than smallpox eradication due to the need for sustained health system infrastructure rather than a time-limited campaign approach. The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s confronted the WHO with a pandemic that required not only biomedical interventions but also attention to human rights, stigma, and social determinants of disease transmission. The organization’s initial response to HIV/AIDS revealed limitations in its ability to rapidly mobilize resources and coordinate action on emerging infectious diseases, leading to subsequent reforms and the establishment of more flexible mechanisms for responding to health emergencies.\nThe late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries brought new challenges that tested and reshaped the WHO. The 2003 SARS outbreak demonstrated the speed with which infectious diseases could spread through air travel and the importance of transparent reporting and international cooperation in outbreak control. This experience led to revision of the International Health Regulations, which entered into force in 2005, creating binding obligations for countries to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic further highlighted challenges in pandemic preparedness and risk communication. The 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic, which caused over eleven thousand deaths, revealed serious deficiencies in the WHO’s emergency response capacity and led to creation of the Health Emergencies Programme to consolidate the organization’s outbreak response functions under unified leadership.\n\n\nOrganizational Structure and Governance\nThe WHO’s organizational architecture reflects its dual nature as both a technical agency providing scientific guidance and a diplomatic forum where member states negotiate health policy and allocate resources. The World Health Assembly serves as the organization’s supreme decision-making body, convening annually in Geneva each May. The Assembly comprises delegations from all member states, currently numbering 194 countries, making it one of the most universal international forums. Each member state has one vote regardless of population size or financial contribution, embodying the principle of sovereign equality. The Assembly’s functions include approving the organization’s budget, electing the Director-General, adopting conventions and agreements, and establishing health policies. Major decisions require a two-thirds majority, while procedural matters need only simple majorities.\nThe Executive Board consists of thirty-four members who are technically qualified in health and designated by member states elected by the World Health Assembly. Board members serve three-year terms and are selected to ensure geographic representation across the WHO’s six regional groupings. The Board meets at least twice annually, with its main session held in January to prepare the agenda for the World Health Assembly. The Board gives effect to Assembly decisions, advises on policy matters, and provides general direction to the Director-General. While formally the Board members serve in their personal capacity as experts rather than as representatives of their governments, in practice they typically reflect their countries’ positions on contentious issues, creating tension between the Board’s technical advisory function and political considerations.\nThe Director-General serves as the WHO’s chief technical and administrative officer, elected by the World Health Assembly for a five-year term and eligible for reelection once. The Director-General’s role combines scientific leadership, diplomatic skill, and administrative management. The position requires navigating among member states with divergent interests while maintaining the organization’s scientific credibility and advancing its health objectives. The Director-General appoints six Regional Directors who head the WHO’s regional organizations, though these Regional Directors are first nominated by their respective Regional Committees. This arrangement creates a matrix structure where Regional Directors report both to the Director-General and to their Regional Committees, sometimes producing tensions between global priorities and regional preferences.\nThe WHO’s regional structure represents a distinctive organizational feature that differentiates it from many other UN agencies. Six regional organizations correspond to different geographic areas: the African Region headquartered in Brazzaville, the Region of the Americas in Washington DC, the Eastern Mediterranean Region in Cairo, the European Region in Copenhagen, the South-East Asia Region in New Delhi, and the Western Pacific Region in Manila. Each regional organization has its own constitution and governing bodies, with Regional Committees comprising representatives from member states in that region. Regional offices develop programs addressing specific health challenges in their areas, adapt global policies to regional contexts, and provide technical support to countries. This decentralized structure enables responsiveness to diverse epidemiological and health system contexts but can also create fragmentation and inconsistency in how global policies are implemented across regions.\nThe WHO Secretariat, led by the Director-General, comprises the international civil servants who carry out the organization’s technical and administrative work. The Secretariat is organized into clusters covering different health domains, including communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health systems, and emergency preparedness and response. Staff members are recruited from member states, and the organization strives for geographic and gender balance while maintaining technical expertise. The Secretariat’s approximately eight thousand employees work across headquarters, regional offices, and country offices, though this staff size is modest relative to the organization’s global mandate. The relatively small staff reflects both budgetary constraints and the WHO’s role as primarily a normative and coordinating agency rather than an implementing organization.\nCountry offices represent the WHO’s presence in most member states, serving as the primary interface between the organization and national health authorities. Country offices support ministries of health in developing health policies, strengthening health systems, implementing disease control programs, and responding to emergencies. The WHO Representatives who lead country offices play important diplomatic and technical roles, advising governments while ensuring that WHO programs align with country priorities and capacities. The effectiveness of country offices varies considerably depending on the country context, the skills and experience of WHO staff, and the strength of relationships with national counterparts.\n\n\nFinancing and Budgetary Challenges\nThe WHO’s financing structure significantly shapes its capacity to fulfill its mandate and has been subject to ongoing debate and concern. The organization’s budget comprises assessed contributions from member states and voluntary contributions from member states, philanthropic foundations, and other donors. Assessed contributions are calculated based on countries’ capacity to pay, similar to the United Nations regular budget. However, assessed contributions have remained essentially frozen since the early 1990s and currently represent only about twenty percent of the WHO’s total budget. This means the organization depends heavily on voluntary contributions for approximately eighty percent of its funding, a situation that creates significant challenges for strategic planning and autonomy.\nVoluntary contributions are often earmarked for specific programs, diseases, or geographic areas according to donor preferences rather than WHO priorities determined through its governing bodies. This creates a fragmented funding structure where some programs are well-resourced while others struggle with inadequate funding. For example, polio eradication and vaccine-preventable diseases have received substantial voluntary funding, while programs addressing chronic diseases or health systems strengthening often face resource constraints. The dependence on voluntary funding also means that economic downturns or shifts in donor priorities can rapidly affect program implementation. Furthermore, the influence of major donors, whether governments or private foundations, raises questions about the extent to which the WHO can maintain independence in setting health priorities versus responding to donor interests.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has emerged as one of the largest voluntary contributors to the WHO, sometimes providing more funding than major governments. While this philanthropic support has enabled important programs, particularly in infectious disease control and immunization, it has also generated concerns about the influence of private actors on global health priority-setting and the extent to which the WHO’s agenda reflects the preferences of wealthy donors rather than the collective decisions of member states. These concerns intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic when questions arose about the influence of various stakeholders on the WHO’s decision-making processes.\nBudget cycles follow a biennial pattern, with the World Health Assembly approving a Programme Budget for two-year periods. The budget is divided between base programs that address the WHO’s core normative and technical work and outbreak and crisis response that provides flexible resources for emergencies. Recent budgets have exceeded six billion US dollars for the biennium, though actual expenditures depend on the mobilization of voluntary contributions. Efforts to reform the WHO’s financing have included proposals to gradually increase assessed contributions to provide a more stable and flexible resource base, but progress has been slow due to member state resistance to increasing their mandatory financial obligations.\n\n\nCore Functions and Normative Work\nThe WHO’s Constitution establishes broad functions that encompass providing leadership on health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring health trends. These functions are operationalized through various mechanisms that generate global public goods and support country-level action.\nNormative work represents a core WHO function that distinguishes it from implementation-focused organizations. The WHO develops international standards, guidelines, and recommendations that shape health practices worldwide. The International Classification of Diseases, maintained by the WHO since 1948, provides a systematic framework for coding diseases and health conditions used globally for epidemiological analysis, health management, and clinical purposes. The current eleventh revision, ICD-11, reflects advances in medical science and changes in understanding of health conditions. Similarly, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health provides a framework for measuring health and disability at individual and population levels.\nThe WHO’s essential medicines program develops the Model List of Essential Medicines, updated biennially, which identifies medicines that satisfy the priority health needs of populations. This list, first published in 1977, has influenced national medicine policies worldwide and focuses attention on ensuring availability of cost-effective, quality-assured medicines. The selection criteria emphasize evidence of efficacy, safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness. Many countries base their national essential medicines lists on the WHO model, and the list influences procurement decisions by international organizations and programs. The WHO also establishes standards for pharmaceutical quality through its prequalification program, which assesses the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines and vaccines produced by manufacturers worldwide, particularly benefiting low- and middle-income countries that may lack robust national regulatory capacity.\nThe development of clinical practice guidelines constitutes another important normative function. The WHO produces evidence-based recommendations on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and health conditions. These guidelines synthesize scientific evidence through systematic reviews and expert consultations, using standardized methodologies such as the GRADING approach to assess quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Guidelines cover diverse topics including management of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, treatment of noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health interventions, and mental health services. While countries adapt these guidelines to local contexts, they provide authoritative technical guidance particularly valuable for settings with limited capacity for independent guideline development.\nThe International Health Regulations constitute a legally binding instrument that governs how countries respond to public health emergencies with potential for international spread. The current regulations, adopted in 2005 following the SARS outbreak, require countries to develop core capacities for disease surveillance and response, notify the WHO of events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern, and implement measures to prevent disease spread while minimizing interference with international traffic and trade. The regulations represent a balance between protecting global health security and respecting national sovereignty. The WHO Director-General has authority to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern based on advice from an Emergency Committee, triggering temporary recommendations for countries. Such declarations were made for H1N1 influenza in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014 and 2018, Zika in 2016, COVID-19 in 2020, and mpox in 2022 and 2024. The implementation of the International Health Regulations remains uneven across countries, with many low- and middle-income countries lacking the resources to fully develop required core capacities.\nHealth statistics and monitoring constitute essential WHO functions that enable evidence-based policy making. The organization collects, validates, and disseminates health data from countries, producing flagship publications including the World Health Statistics annual report and the Global Health Observatory data repository. The WHO also coordinates health measurement efforts such as the Global Burden of Disease estimates developed with partners, which quantify mortality and morbidity from diseases, injuries, and risk factors. These data products inform priority-setting, resource allocation, and monitoring of progress toward health goals. The WHO has worked to strengthen country capacity for health information systems through frameworks such as the Health Metrics Network and support for civil registration and vital statistics systems.\n\n\nPrograms Addressing Communicable Diseases\nThe WHO’s communicable disease programs reflect both historical priorities and ongoing challenges from infectious diseases that continue to cause substantial mortality and morbidity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, launched in 1988, represents one of the WHO’s most ambitious disease control efforts. The initiative brought together the WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in a partnership to eradicate polio through mass immunization campaigns supplemented by surveillance and outbreak response. The program has reduced polio cases by more than ninety-nine percent, with wild poliovirus transmission now limited to Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, final eradication has proven challenging due to insecurity in affected areas, vaccine hesitancy, and the problem of vaccine-derived poliovirus that can emerge in areas with low immunization coverage.\nThe Global Tuberculosis Programme addresses a disease that kills approximately 1.3 million people annually despite being preventable and curable. The WHO’s End TB Strategy, launched in 2015, aims for a ninety percent reduction in tuberculosis deaths and an eighty percent reduction in tuberculosis incidence by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. The program promotes the DOTS strategy (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) to ensure treatment completion, addresses drug-resistant tuberculosis through expanded access to rapid diagnostic tests and second-line medicines, and works to integrate tuberculosis services with HIV programs since tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV. The program also addresses social determinants of tuberculosis including poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate housing, recognizing that biomedical interventions alone cannot eliminate the disease.\nThe Global Malaria Programme coordinates efforts against a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes over 600,000 deaths annually, predominantly among children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO’s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria aims for a ninety percent reduction in malaria incidence and mortality by 2030 compared to 2015. The program promotes proven interventions including insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnostic testing, and artemisinin-based combination therapies for treatment. The program also coordinates efforts to address emerging challenges including insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites. Recent innovations include the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, which the WHO recommended in 2021 for children in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission.\nHIV/AIDS programs have evolved significantly since the WHO established the Global Programme on AIDS in 1987. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), created in 1996, assumed leadership for coordinating the UN system response to HIV, though the WHO retains important technical functions including developing treatment guidelines, supporting country programs, and providing strategic information. The WHO’s HIV program promotes the “treat all” approach whereby all people diagnosed with HIV should immediately start antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 count. The program also addresses prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision in high-prevalence settings, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Integration of HIV services with tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, and other programs seeks to improve efficiency and access.\nNeglected tropical diseases constitute a group of diverse infectious diseases that disproportionately affect poor populations in tropical areas. The WHO’s program on neglected tropical diseases coordinates efforts against twenty conditions including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, rabies, and leishmaniasis among others. Many neglected tropical diseases can be prevented or controlled through cost-effective interventions including mass drug administration, vector control, improved water and sanitation, and case management. The WHO’s 2021-2030 road map aims to eliminate at least one neglected tropical disease in one hundred countries and reduce by ninety percent the number of people requiring interventions. The program works through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that donate medicines, endemic countries that implement control programs, and international organizations that provide funding and technical support.\nVaccine-preventable diseases remain a focus through the Expanded Programme on Immunization and work on vaccine introduction and coverage. The WHO develops recommendations on vaccine use through the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, which reviews evidence on vaccines and provides guidance on immunization policies. The organization supports countries in introducing new vaccines, strengthening cold chain systems, improving coverage with existing vaccines, and addressing vaccine hesitancy. The COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in routine immunization services, with millions of children missing vaccines, requiring catch-up campaigns to restore coverage and prevent outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.\nEmerging infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness have received increased attention following SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. The WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, established in 2016, consolidates the organization’s capacity to detect, assess, and respond to disease outbreaks and humanitarian emergencies. The program operates emergency operations centers, deploys rapid response teams, coordinates international assistance, and provides technical guidance during outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, tested the organization’s emergency response capacity at unprecedented scale. The WHO provided technical guidance on case detection, clinical management, and infection prevention and control; coordinated research efforts; and launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) partnership to accelerate development, production, and equitable distribution of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.\n\n\nPrograms Addressing Noncommunicable Diseases\nNoncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes have emerged as the leading causes of mortality globally, responsible for approximately seventy percent of deaths. The WHO’s response to noncommunicable diseases evolved more slowly than its communicable disease programs, reflecting historical emphasis on infectious diseases and the perception that chronic diseases were primarily problems of wealthy countries. The political declaration on noncommunicable diseases adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011 represented a turning point, recognizing that these diseases impede social and economic development and require coordinated international action.\nThe WHO’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2030 established voluntary global targets including a twenty-five percent relative reduction in premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases by 2025, later extended to a thirty percent reduction by 2030. The action plan identifies cost-effective interventions termed “best buys” that provide high return on investment and are feasible for all countries. These interventions address risk factors including tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which entered into force in 2005, represents the organization’s first treaty and establishes comprehensive tobacco control measures including taxation, smoke-free policies, health warnings, bans on advertising and promotion, and support for cessation.\nThe WHO’s efforts to address unhealthy diet and physical inactivity include recommendations on sugar, salt, and saturated fat intake; guidelines on physical activity for different age groups; and support for countries implementing policies such as sugar-sweetened beverage taxes, front-of-package labeling, restrictions on marketing unhealthy foods to children, and urban design that promotes active transportation. The global strategy on diet, physical activity, and health, adopted in 2004, called for multisectoral action engaging not only health sectors but also agriculture, education, trade, and urban planning. Implementation has faced challenges including opposition from food and beverage industries and limited political will in some countries to adopt regulatory measures.\nMental health, neurological disorders, and substance use disorders collectively affect hundreds of millions of people globally yet have historically received inadequate attention and resources, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The WHO’s Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 aims to promote mental wellbeing, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights, and reduce mortality and morbidity. The mhGAP (Mental Health Gap Action Programme) provides evidence-based guidelines and tools for delivering mental health interventions in non-specialized health settings, addressing the shortage of mental health specialists in many countries. The program covers priority conditions including depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, developmental disorders in children, behavioral disorders, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, and self-harm and suicide.\nCancer control efforts address a group of diseases that kill approximately ten million people annually. The WHO’s cancer programs promote comprehensive cancer control including prevention through reduction of risk factors such as tobacco use, vaccination against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B which cause cervical and liver cancers respectively, early detection through screening programs for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers, treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and palliative care for advanced disease. The organization’s work on access to pain relief medications addresses the global imbalance where most controlled medicines are available in high-income countries while patients in many low- and middle-income countries lack access to essential pain control, particularly morphine for cancer pain.\n\n\nHealth Systems Strengthening and Universal Health Coverage\nThe WHO’s work on health systems addresses the foundational structures and functions that enable delivery of health services. The health systems framework identifies six building blocks: service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership and governance. Strengthening health systems requires attention to each component and their interactions, recognizing that weakness in one area can undermine overall system performance. The Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care, adopted at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 1978, established primary health care as the key to achieving health for all. The declaration emphasized comprehensive primary health care encompassing promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services as close as possible to where people live and work, delivered through participatory approaches engaging communities in health decisions.\nUniversal health coverage has emerged as a central organizing principle for health systems development, embodied in Sustainable Development Goal target 3.8 which aims to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, ensuring that all people have access to needed health services without financial hardship. The WHO defines universal health coverage as requiring that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. This requires sufficiently strong health systems, financing arrangements that prevent impoverishment from health expenses, and prioritization of essential services based on evidence and ethics.\nThe WHO’s work on health financing promotes domestic resource mobilization, efficient allocation and use of resources, and financial protection mechanisms such as health insurance and other prepayment schemes that pool risks across populations. The organization analyzes health expenditure patterns, tracks out-of-pocket payments that cause financial hardship, and provides technical support for countries designing or reforming health financing systems. The emphasis has shifted from focusing solely on increasing overall health spending to ensuring that resources are used effectively and equitably, reaching underserved populations and addressing priority health needs.\nHuman resources for health constitute a critical constraint for many health systems. The global health workforce shortage, particularly of doctors, nurses, and midwives in low- and middle-income countries, limits capacity to expand service coverage. The WHO’s Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health provides a framework for addressing workforce challenges through improving production of health workers, retaining workers particularly in underserved areas, and ensuring supportive work environments with adequate remuneration, career development opportunities, and decent working conditions. The organization also addresses health worker migration through the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, which establishes ethical principles for recruitment while recognizing the rights of health workers to migrate.\nQuality of care has received increased attention as evidence accumulated that even when services are available and accessible, poor quality can prevent achievement of health outcomes. The WHO defines quality of care as health care that is effective, safe, people-centered, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. The organization develops technical standards and guidelines for quality improvement, supports countries in implementing quality assurance programs, and promotes patient safety initiatives addressing adverse events, medication errors, health care-associated infections, and other threats to safety.\n\n\nReproductive Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health\nThe WHO’s programs addressing reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health aim to reduce preventable deaths and ensure healthy development throughout the life course. Despite substantial progress over recent decades, approximately 287,000 women still die annually from pregnancy and childbirth complications, 2.4 million newborns die in their first month of life, and 5.2 million children under age five die, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries and being preventable with known interventions.\nThe Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health provides a framework for action across three objectives: survive by ending preventable deaths, thrive by ensuring health and wellbeing, and transform by expanding enabling environments. The strategy promotes evidence-based interventions delivered across the continuum of care from pre-pregnancy through pregnancy, childbirth, the postnatal period, and childhood. Key interventions include antenatal care, skilled attendance at delivery, emergency obstetric care, postnatal care, exclusive breastfeeding, immunization, management of childhood illnesses, and adolescent health services addressing sexual and reproductive health, mental health, nutrition, and prevention of injuries and violence.\nThe WHO’s work on sexual and reproductive health addresses family planning, maternal health, prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, prevention of unsafe abortion, and management of reproductive health problems such as infertility and reproductive tract cancers. The organization advocates for a human rights-based approach that respects reproductive autonomy and ensures access to information and services without discrimination. The program emphasizes that sexual and reproductive health and rights are integral to health systems and essential for achieving universal health coverage.\nNutrition programs address both undernutrition including stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. The WHO’s nutrition guidance covers infant and young child feeding including promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and appropriate complementary feeding; micronutrient supplementation and food fortification; management of severe acute malnutrition; and prevention and management of overweight and obesity. The organization works with countries to develop nutrition policies and programs, improve nutrition surveillance, and strengthen capacity for nutrition action across sectors including health, agriculture, education, and social protection.\n\n\nEnvironmental Health and Climate Change\nEnvironmental health determinants significantly influence disease burdens and health inequalities. The WHO estimates that environmental risk factors contribute to approximately one quarter of the global disease burden. The organization’s environmental health programs address air pollution, both outdoor air pollution from industry, transportation, and energy production, and household air pollution from use of polluting fuels for cooking and heating. Air pollution causes approximately seven million premature deaths annually through cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. The WHO’s air quality guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations on pollutant levels to protect health and serve as reference for national standards and policy development.\nWater, sanitation, and hygiene remain fundamental health determinants, with inadequate services causing diarrheal disease, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, and contributing to malnutrition and stunting. Despite progress, billions of people still lack safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The WHO collaborates with governments and partners to strengthen water quality surveillance, promote safe sanitation technologies, and integrate water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions into health programs addressing maternal and child health, nutrition, and neglected tropical diseases.\nChemical safety programs address occupational and environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals including pesticides, industrial chemicals, and chemicals in consumer products. The WHO conducts health risk assessments for chemicals, develops guidance on chemical exposure limits, and supports countries in strengthening chemical safety management. Lead poisoning, mercury exposure, pesticide poisoning, and asbestos-related diseases represent significant but often preventable health burdens.\nClimate change poses mounting threats to health through multiple pathways including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, changing patterns of vector-borne diseases as geographic ranges of mosquitoes and other vectors expand, impacts on food security and nutrition, water scarcity, and population displacement. The WHO’s climate and health program aims to strengthen health sector capacity to protect populations from climate risks through climate-resilient health systems, surveillance for climate-sensitive health outcomes, promotion of mitigation measures that also improve health such as active transportation and clean energy, and incorporation of health considerations into climate change adaptation plans.\n\n\nHealth Security and Epidemic Preparedness\nHealth security encompasses protection from acute threats to collective health whether from disease outbreaks, chemical or radiological incidents, or bioterrorism. The International Health Regulations provide the legal framework for health security, but implementation requires substantial national capacity for surveillance, laboratory confirmation, risk assessment, and response coordination. The WHO supports countries in building core capacities through the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and joint external evaluations that assess preparedness levels and identify gaps requiring investment.\nThe Research and Development Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, launched in 2015, aims to accelerate development of medical countermeasures for diseases with epidemic potential that lack adequate tools. The blueprint identifies priority diseases based on epidemic potential and absence of effective interventions, and works to accelerate research and development through coordinated action among researchers, funders, and developers. Target disease profile development, clinical trial networks, and regulatory pathway guidance seek to reduce time from pathogen identification to deployment of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed both strengths and weaknesses in global health security architecture. The WHO’s early risk assessments, technical guidance development, and coordination of scientific research demonstrated its technical capacity and convening power. However, delays in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, variable quality of guidance on mask use and other interventions as evidence evolved, and challenges in the ACT-Accelerator particularly regarding vaccine equity attracted criticism. The pandemic exposed fundamental tensions between national sovereignty and global solidarity, with countries prioritizing domestic populations over equitable international distribution of scarce vaccines and other countermeasures. Proposals for reform include strengthening the WHO’s investigative authority during disease outbreaks, creating sustainable financing for pandemic preparedness, and developing binding mechanisms to ensure equitable access to medical countermeasures during health emergencies.\n\n\nHealth in Humanitarian Emergencies\nArmed conflicts, natural disasters, and complex emergencies create acute health needs while disrupting health systems. The WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme addresses health in humanitarian crises through rapid needs assessments, coordination of health response, provision of essential medicines and supplies, disease surveillance and outbreak response, and support for restoring health services. The Health Cluster coordination mechanism brings together humanitarian organizations to ensure comprehensive health response avoiding gaps and duplication.\nEmergencies create particular vulnerabilities for women, children, persons with disabilities, and older people who may face barriers to accessing services and increased risks of violence, exploitation, and neglect. Emergency health response must address both injuries and trauma directly caused by crises and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions when routine care is disrupted. Mental health and psychosocial support constitute essential components of humanitarian health response, addressing traumatic stress, grief, family separation, and threats to safety and dignity.\nThe Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) collects and disseminates information on health facilities and services in countries affected by emergencies, enabling response actors to identify functional health facilities, gaps in service coverage, and priority needs for health system recovery. The WHO’s Emergency Medical Teams initiative establishes standards for clinical teams deployed internationally to provide surgical, trauma, and critical care during emergencies, ensuring quality and accountability of foreign medical teams.\n\n\nContemporary challenges And criticisms\nThe WHO faces significant challenges in fulfilling its mandate in the contemporary global health landscape. Geopolitical tensions affect the organization’s functioning, with member states sometimes prioritizing national interests over collective action and using the WHO as an arena for broader political conflicts. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified such tensions, with the United States temporarily withdrawing from the WHO in 2020 over allegations of Chinese influence and mishandling of the pandemic response. Although the United States rejoined in 2021, the episode highlighted the organization’s vulnerability to great power politics.\nFunding constraints limit the WHO’s ability to adequately address the breadth of health challenges within its mandate. The dependence on voluntary contributions and their earmarking for donor priorities rather than WHO priorities as determined through its governance structures raises questions about whether the organization can maintain strategic coherence and independence. Proposals for funding reform including increasing assessed contributions have made limited progress due to member state reluctance to increase mandatory financial obligations without assurances of improved efficiency and results.\nThe proliferation of global health actors including vertical disease programs, public-private partnerships, philanthropic foundations, and civil society organizations has created a crowded and fragmented global health architecture. While this pluralism brings resources and innovation, it also creates coordination challenges and potential for duplication or gaps. The WHO’s role as coordinator is complicated when it depends financially on some of the same actors it is meant to coordinate. Questions arise about whether the WHO should prioritize normative work, providing global public goods through standard-setting and technical guidance, or whether it should also maintain significant operational capacity for country support and emergency response.\nCriticisms of the WHO’s performance have come from various directions. Some argue the organization is too bureaucratic and slow to respond to emerging challenges, citing delays in declaring public health emergencies and updating guidance as evidence evolves. Others contend the WHO has been captured by pharmaceutical interests or wealthy donors who shape the agenda toward interventions that benefit industry rather than addressing social determinants of health. The organization has also faced criticism for insufficient attention to equity and human rights, with some pointing to gaps between the values espoused in WHO documents and the accessibility of services and technologies in practice.\nThe tension between the WHO’s technical and political functions creates inherent challenges. As a technical agency, the WHO should provide objective scientific guidance based on evidence. As an intergovernmental organization, it must operate through consensus among member states with diverse perspectives and interests. When scientific evidence points toward recommendations that some member states oppose for political, economic, or cultural reasons, the WHO must navigate between scientific integrity and political feasibility. This tension appears in debates over sexual and reproductive health, harm reduction approaches to drug use, health consequences of conflict and occupation, and numerous other issues where evidence and politics may diverge.\n\n\nFuture Directions and Reforms\nOngoing discussions about the future of global health governance and the WHO’s role within it address several key themes. Strengthening pandemic preparedness and response capacity includes proposals for a new international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response that would establish binding commitments on surveillance, information sharing, equitable access to medical countermeasures, and financing. Negotiations on this pandemic accord have proven contentious, with divisions over intellectual property provisions, financing obligations, and the balance between national sovereignty and international solidarity.\nSustainable financing reform seeks to increase the proportion of the WHO’s budget from assessed contributions, which would provide more flexible and predictable resources and reduce dependence on earmarked voluntary contributions. The WHO has proposed gradually increasing assessed contributions and replenishing the reserves for health emergencies. However, meaningful reform requires member state agreement to increase their financial commitments, which faces political resistance in many countries.\nDigital health technologies offer opportunities for expanding service reach, improving data collection and use, and enabling new models of care delivery. The WHO has developed strategies and guidance on digital health, addressing topics including mobile health interventions, telemedicine, artificial intelligence in health care, and digital health data governance. Ensuring that digital health technologies reduce rather than exacerbate inequalities requires attention to digital literacy, connectivity infrastructure, and policies that protect privacy and prevent misuse of health data.\nThe shift toward multisectoral action to address health determinants beyond the health sector reflects recognition that many health outcomes are shaped by factors including education, housing, employment, food systems, and environmental conditions. The Health in All Policies approach promotes consideration of health implications in policy decisions across government sectors. However, implementing multisectoral action faces challenges including competing sector priorities, lack of mechanisms for cross-sector coordination, and difficulties attributing health outcomes to specific policy actions.\nAddressing health inequalities within and between countries remains a central challenge requiring attention to the social, economic, and political determinants that create systematic differences in health opportunities and outcomes. The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health documented how inequitable distribution of power, income, goods, and services shapes health and produced the 2008 report “Closing the Gap in a Generation” with recommendations for action on health equity. Implementation requires political will to address structural inequalities and power dynamics that maintain health disparities.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe World Health Organization stands at a critical juncture after more than seventy-five years of existence. The COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously demonstrated the indispensable value of global health coordination and exposed significant limitations in the current architecture. The WHO’s technical expertise, normative authority, and convening power remain essential assets for addressing health challenges that transcend borders and exceed the capacity of any single nation to solve. Yet the organization’s ability to fulfill its constitutional mandate of helping all peoples attain the highest possible level of health depends on resolving fundamental tensions around financing, governance, and the balance between national sovereignty and collective action.\nThe epidemiological transition, whereby noncommunicable diseases have become leading causes of death globally while new infectious diseases continue to emerge and established infections remain major problems in many settings, requires the WHO to maintain broad programmatic scope. Climate change, demographic aging, urbanization, and globalization create new health challenges requiring innovative approaches. Advances in biomedical science offer unprecedented opportunities for disease prevention and treatment but also raise complex ethical questions about equity, access, and appropriate use of new technologies.\nThe health impacts of conflict, forced migration, environmental degradation, and economic inequality demonstrate that health security and health equity are intertwined and that neither can be achieved without addressing fundamental political and economic structures. The WHO operates within a global system characterized by deep power asymmetries and competing interests, limiting what any international organization can accomplish without sustained political commitment from member states.\nNevertheless, the WHO’s history demonstrates the potential for international cooperation to achieve significant health gains. The eradication of smallpox, expansion of immunization coverage saving millions of lives, development of clinical guidelines improving care worldwide, and coordinated responses to disease outbreaks represent meaningful accomplishments. The Sustainable Development Goals’ aspiration for universal health coverage by 2030, while unlikely to be fully achieved on that timeline, provides a vision and framework for action toward health systems that serve all people without financial hardship.\nStrengthening the WHO and global health governance more broadly requires confronting difficult questions about priorities, resources, accountability, and the distribution of benefits and burdens in global health cooperation. It requires moving beyond narrow biomedical approaches to address the social, environmental, and political determinants that fundamentally shape population health. It requires building trust through transparency, inclusion of diverse perspectives and knowledge systems, and demonstrated commitment to equity. Most fundamentally, it requires recognition that in an interconnected world, health anywhere depends on health everywhere, and that effective responses to shared health threats require collective action grounded in solidarity, not merely enlightened self-interest.\nThe next chapter in the WHO’s evolution will be written through the choices that member states, civil society, and other stakeholders make about the kind of global health system they wish to create and the resources and political commitment they are willing to invest in that vision. The technical knowledge and tools exist to dramatically improve health outcomes worldwide, but translating that potential into reality requires confronting the political and economic barriers that perpetuate health inequalities and limit collective action. The WHO’s future effectiveness depends not only on internal reforms but on fundamental changes in how the international community approaches global health as a shared responsibility and public good requiring sustained cooperation and mutual accountability."

    "text": "The World Health Organization stands as the preeminent international institution dedicated to the advancement of health and wellbeing for all humanity. Established in the aftermath of the Second World War during a period of unprecedented international cooperation and institution-building, the WHO emerged from a recognition that health challenges transcend national boundaries and that coordinated global action remains essential for addressing the fundamental determinants of disease and promoting universal health security. Since its inception, the organization has evolved from a modest coordinating body into a complex multilateral institution that shapes health policy, coordinates responses to disease outbreaks, establishes normative standards, and provides technical assistance to nations across all stages of economic development.\nUnderstanding the WHO’s role in contemporary global health requires examination of its historical foundations, organizational architecture, programmatic initiatives, and the evolving challenges it faces in an increasingly interconnected yet politically fragmented world. The organization operates at the intersection of scientific expertise, diplomatic negotiation, and practical implementation, attempting to balance the sometimes competing demands of sovereign nations while pursuing the universal goal of health for all people. This article explores the multifaceted nature of the WHO, examining how its structure enables its functions, how its programs address both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and how it has adapted to meet emerging health challenges in the twenty-first century."

    "text": "The origins of international health cooperation predate the WHO by more than a century. The first International Sanitary Conference convened in Paris in 1851, bringing together twelve European nations to address cholera epidemics that repeatedly swept across continents through expanding trade routes. These early conferences, though often hampered by competing national interests and limited scientific understanding of disease transmission, established the principle that epidemic diseases required coordinated international responses. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed the establishment of several regional and international health organizations, including the Pan American Sanitary Bureau in 1902, which later became the Pan American Health Organization, and the Office International d’Hygiène Publique established in Paris in 1907.\nThe League of Nations, founded after the First World War, created its Health Organization in 1923, marking a significant advance in international health cooperation. The League’s Health Organization conducted pioneering work in standardizing biological products, establishing health intelligence systems, and providing technical assistance to member states. Despite the League’s ultimate political failure and the outbreak of the Second World War, its Health Organization demonstrated the value of sustained international collaboration on health matters and provided organizational models that would influence the WHO’s later structure.\nThe founding of the United Nations in 1945 created momentum for establishing a comprehensive international health organization. During the United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco, delegates from Brazil and China proposed creating a new autonomous international health organization. The subsequent International Health Conference, convened in New York in 1946, drafted the WHO Constitution, which was signed by representatives of sixty-one countries. The Constitution’s preamble contained an expansive definition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,” reflecting post-war optimism about the possibility of achieving universal wellbeing through international cooperation and scientific advancement.\nThe WHO officially came into existence on April 7, 1948, when twenty-six member states ratified its Constitution. This date is now commemorated annually as World Health Day. The organization absorbed the functions and assets of the League of Nations Health Organization and the Office International d’Hygiène Publique, providing continuity with earlier international health efforts while establishing a broader mandate and more robust institutional framework. The WHO’s early headquarters in Geneva symbolically positioned the organization in neutral Switzerland, emphasizing its role as an impartial technical agency serving all nations regardless of political alignment during the emerging Cold War.\nThe organization’s first major triumph came through the global smallpox eradication campaign, which commenced in 1967 under the leadership of American epidemiologist D.A. Henderson. The campaign demonstrated the potential for coordinated international action to eliminate disease through systematic vaccination, surveillance, and containment strategies. The last naturally occurring case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia in 1977, and the World Health Assembly certified global eradication in 1980. This achievement stands as one of humanity’s greatest public health accomplishments and validated the WHO’s role as coordinator of global health initiatives. The smallpox campaign also generated important lessons about disease surveillance, laboratory networks, and the challenges of maintaining program momentum across diverse political and geographic contexts.\nFollowing the smallpox success, the WHO launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974, aiming to ensure universal access to vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and tuberculosis. This program significantly increased global vaccination coverage, though achieving universal immunization proved more challenging than smallpox eradication due to the need for sustained health system infrastructure rather than a time-limited campaign approach. The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s confronted the WHO with a pandemic that required not only biomedical interventions but also attention to human rights, stigma, and social determinants of disease transmission. The organization’s initial response to HIV/AIDS revealed limitations in its ability to rapidly mobilize resources and coordinate action on emerging infectious diseases, leading to subsequent reforms and the establishment of more flexible mechanisms for responding to health emergencies.\nThe late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries brought new challenges that tested and reshaped the WHO. The 2003 SARS outbreak demonstrated the speed with which infectious diseases could spread through air travel and the importance of transparent reporting and international cooperation in outbreak control. This experience led to revision of the International Health Regulations, which entered into force in 2005, creating binding obligations for countries to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic further highlighted challenges in pandemic preparedness and risk communication. The 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic, which caused over eleven thousand deaths, revealed serious deficiencies in the WHO’s emergency response capacity and led to creation of the Health Emergencies Programme to consolidate the organization’s outbreak response functions under unified leadership."

    "text": "The WHO’s organizational architecture reflects its dual nature as both a technical agency providing scientific guidance and a diplomatic forum where member states negotiate health policy and allocate resources. The World Health Assembly serves as the organization’s supreme decision-making body, convening annually in Geneva each May. The Assembly comprises delegations from all member states, currently numbering 194 countries, making it one of the most universal international forums. Each member state has one vote regardless of population size or financial contribution, embodying the principle of sovereign equality. The Assembly’s functions include approving the organization’s budget, electing the Director-General, adopting conventions and agreements, and establishing health policies. Major decisions require a two-thirds majority, while procedural matters need only simple majorities.\nThe Executive Board consists of thirty-four members who are technically qualified in health and designated by member states elected by the World Health Assembly. Board members serve three-year terms and are selected to ensure geographic representation across the WHO’s six regional groupings. The Board meets at least twice annually, with its main session held in January to prepare the agenda for the World Health Assembly. The Board gives effect to Assembly decisions, advises on policy matters, and provides general direction to the Director-General. While formally the Board members serve in their personal capacity as experts rather than as representatives of their governments, in practice they typically reflect their countries’ positions on contentious issues, creating tension between the Board’s technical advisory function and political considerations.\nThe Director-General serves as the WHO’s chief technical and administrative officer, elected by the World Health Assembly for a five-year term and eligible for reelection once. The Director-General’s role combines scientific leadership, diplomatic skill, and administrative management. The position requires navigating among member states with divergent interests while maintaining the organization’s scientific credibility and advancing its health objectives. The Director-General appoints six Regional Directors who head the WHO’s regional organizations, though these Regional Directors are first nominated by their respective Regional Committees. This arrangement creates a matrix structure where Regional Directors report both to the Director-General and to their Regional Committees, sometimes producing tensions between global priorities and regional preferences.\nThe WHO’s regional structure represents a distinctive organizational feature that differentiates it from many other UN agencies. Six regional organizations correspond to different geographic areas: the African Region headquartered in Brazzaville, the Region of the Americas in Washington DC, the Eastern Mediterranean Region in Cairo, the European Region in Copenhagen, the South-East Asia Region in New Delhi, and the Western Pacific Region in Manila. Each regional organization has its own constitution and governing bodies, with Regional Committees comprising representatives from member states in that region. Regional offices develop programs addressing specific health challenges in their areas, adapt global policies to regional contexts, and provide technical support to countries. This decentralized structure enables responsiveness to diverse epidemiological and health system contexts but can also create fragmentation and inconsistency in how global policies are implemented across regions.\nThe WHO Secretariat, led by the Director-General, comprises the international civil servants who carry out the organization’s technical and administrative work. The Secretariat is organized into clusters covering different health domains, including communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health systems, and emergency preparedness and response. Staff members are recruited from member states, and the organization strives for geographic and gender balance while maintaining technical expertise. The Secretariat’s approximately eight thousand employees work across headquarters, regional offices, and country offices, though this staff size is modest relative to the organization’s global mandate. The relatively small staff reflects both budgetary constraints and the WHO’s role as primarily a normative and coordinating agency rather than an implementing organization.\nCountry offices represent the WHO’s presence in most member states, serving as the primary interface between the organization and national health authorities. Country offices support ministries of health in developing health policies, strengthening health systems, implementing disease control programs, and responding to emergencies. The WHO Representatives who lead country offices play important diplomatic and technical roles, advising governments while ensuring that WHO programs align with country priorities and capacities. The effectiveness of country offices varies considerably depending on the country context, the skills and experience of WHO staff, and the strength of relationships with national counterparts."

    "text": "The WHO’s financing structure significantly shapes its capacity to fulfill its mandate and has been subject to ongoing debate and concern. The organization’s budget comprises assessed contributions from member states and voluntary contributions from member states, philanthropic foundations, and other donors. Assessed contributions are calculated based on countries’ capacity to pay, similar to the United Nations regular budget. However, assessed contributions have remained essentially frozen since the early 1990s and currently represent only about twenty percent of the WHO’s total budget. This means the organization depends heavily on voluntary contributions for approximately eighty percent of its funding, a situation that creates significant challenges for strategic planning and autonomy.\nVoluntary contributions are often earmarked for specific programs, diseases, or geographic areas according to donor preferences rather than WHO priorities determined through its governing bodies. This creates a fragmented funding structure where some programs are well-resourced while others struggle with inadequate funding. For example, polio eradication and vaccine-preventable diseases have received substantial voluntary funding, while programs addressing chronic diseases or health systems strengthening often face resource constraints. The dependence on voluntary funding also means that economic downturns or shifts in donor priorities can rapidly affect program implementation. Furthermore, the influence of major donors, whether governments or private foundations, raises questions about the extent to which the WHO can maintain independence in setting health priorities versus responding to donor interests.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has emerged as one of the largest voluntary contributors to the WHO, sometimes providing more funding than major governments. While this philanthropic support has enabled important programs, particularly in infectious disease control and immunization, it has also generated concerns about the influence of private actors on global health priority-setting and the extent to which the WHO’s agenda reflects the preferences of wealthy donors rather than the collective decisions of member states. These concerns intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic when questions arose about the influence of various stakeholders on the WHO’s decision-making processes.\nBudget cycles follow a biennial pattern, with the World Health Assembly approving a Programme Budget for two-year periods. The budget is divided between base programs that address the WHO’s core normative and technical work and outbreak and crisis response that provides flexible resources for emergencies. Recent budgets have exceeded six billion US dollars for the biennium, though actual expenditures depend on the mobilization of voluntary contributions. Efforts to reform the WHO’s financing have included proposals to gradually increase assessed contributions to provide a more stable and flexible resource base, but progress has been slow due to member state resistance to increasing their mandatory financial obligations."

    "text": "The WHO’s Constitution establishes broad functions that encompass providing leadership on health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring health trends. These functions are operationalized through various mechanisms that generate global public goods and support country-level action.\nNormative work represents a core WHO function that distinguishes it from implementation-focused organizations. The WHO develops international standards, guidelines, and recommendations that shape health practices worldwide. The International Classification of Diseases, maintained by the WHO since 1948, provides a systematic framework for coding diseases and health conditions used globally for epidemiological analysis, health management, and clinical purposes. The current eleventh revision, ICD-11, reflects advances in medical science and changes in understanding of health conditions. Similarly, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health provides a framework for measuring health and disability at individual and population levels.\nThe WHO’s essential medicines program develops the Model List of Essential Medicines, updated biennially, which identifies medicines that satisfy the priority health needs of populations. This list, first published in 1977, has influenced national medicine policies worldwide and focuses attention on ensuring availability of cost-effective, quality-assured medicines. The selection criteria emphasize evidence of efficacy, safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness. Many countries base their national essential medicines lists on the WHO model, and the list influences procurement decisions by international organizations and programs. The WHO also establishes standards for pharmaceutical quality through its prequalification program, which assesses the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines and vaccines produced by manufacturers worldwide, particularly benefiting low- and middle-income countries that may lack robust national regulatory capacity.\nThe development of clinical practice guidelines constitutes another important normative function. The WHO produces evidence-based recommendations on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and health conditions. These guidelines synthesize scientific evidence through systematic reviews and expert consultations, using standardized methodologies such as the GRADING approach to assess quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Guidelines cover diverse topics including management of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, treatment of noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health interventions, and mental health services. While countries adapt these guidelines to local contexts, they provide authoritative technical guidance particularly valuable for settings with limited capacity for independent guideline development.\nThe International Health Regulations constitute a legally binding instrument that governs how countries respond to public health emergencies with potential for international spread. The current regulations, adopted in 2005 following the SARS outbreak, require countries to develop core capacities for disease surveillance and response, notify the WHO of events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern, and implement measures to prevent disease spread while minimizing interference with international traffic and trade. The regulations represent a balance between protecting global health security and respecting national sovereignty. The WHO Director-General has authority to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern based on advice from an Emergency Committee, triggering temporary recommendations for countries. Such declarations were made for H1N1 influenza in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014 and 2018, Zika in 2016, COVID-19 in 2020, and mpox in 2022 and 2024. The implementation of the International Health Regulations remains uneven across countries, with many low- and middle-income countries lacking the resources to fully develop required core capacities.\nHealth statistics and monitoring constitute essential WHO functions that enable evidence-based policy making. The organization collects, validates, and disseminates health data from countries, producing flagship publications including the World Health Statistics annual report and the Global Health Observatory data repository. The WHO also coordinates health measurement efforts such as the Global Burden of Disease estimates developed with partners, which quantify mortality and morbidity from diseases, injuries, and risk factors. These data products inform priority-setting, resource allocation, and monitoring of progress toward health goals. The WHO has worked to strengthen country capacity for health information systems through frameworks such as the Health Metrics Network and support for civil registration and vital statistics systems."

    "text": "The WHO’s communicable disease programs reflect both historical priorities and ongoing challenges from infectious diseases that continue to cause substantial mortality and morbidity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, launched in 1988, represents one of the WHO’s most ambitious disease control efforts. The initiative brought together the WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in a partnership to eradicate polio through mass immunization campaigns supplemented by surveillance and outbreak response. The program has reduced polio cases by more than ninety-nine percent, with wild poliovirus transmission now limited to Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, final eradication has proven challenging due to insecurity in affected areas, vaccine hesitancy, and the problem of vaccine-derived poliovirus that can emerge in areas with low immunization coverage.\nThe Global Tuberculosis Programme addresses a disease that kills approximately 1.3 million people annually despite being preventable and curable. The WHO’s End TB Strategy, launched in 2015, aims for a ninety percent reduction in tuberculosis deaths and an eighty percent reduction in tuberculosis incidence by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. The program promotes the DOTS strategy (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) to ensure treatment completion, addresses drug-resistant tuberculosis through expanded access to rapid diagnostic tests and second-line medicines, and works to integrate tuberculosis services with HIV programs since tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV. The program also addresses social determinants of tuberculosis including poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate housing, recognizing that biomedical interventions alone cannot eliminate the disease.\nThe Global Malaria Programme coordinates efforts against a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes over 600,000 deaths annually, predominantly among children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO’s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria aims for a ninety percent reduction in malaria incidence and mortality by 2030 compared to 2015. The program promotes proven interventions including insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnostic testing, and artemisinin-based combination therapies for treatment. The program also coordinates efforts to address emerging challenges including insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites. Recent innovations include the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, which the WHO recommended in 2021 for children in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission.\nHIV/AIDS programs have evolved significantly since the WHO established the Global Programme on AIDS in 1987. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), created in 1996, assumed leadership for coordinating the UN system response to HIV, though the WHO retains important technical functions including developing treatment guidelines, supporting country programs, and providing strategic information. The WHO’s HIV program promotes the “treat all” approach whereby all people diagnosed with HIV should immediately start antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 count. The program also addresses prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision in high-prevalence settings, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Integration of HIV services with tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, and other programs seeks to improve efficiency and access.\nNeglected tropical diseases constitute a group of diverse infectious diseases that disproportionately affect poor populations in tropical areas. The WHO’s program on neglected tropical diseases coordinates efforts against twenty conditions including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, rabies, and leishmaniasis among others. Many neglected tropical diseases can be prevented or controlled through cost-effective interventions including mass drug administration, vector control, improved water and sanitation, and case management. The WHO’s 2021-2030 road map aims to eliminate at least one neglected tropical disease in one hundred countries and reduce by ninety percent the number of people requiring interventions. The program works through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that donate medicines, endemic countries that implement control programs, and international organizations that provide funding and technical support.\nVaccine-preventable diseases remain a focus through the Expanded Programme on Immunization and work on vaccine introduction and coverage. The WHO develops recommendations on vaccine use through the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, which reviews evidence on vaccines and provides guidance on immunization policies. The organization supports countries in introducing new vaccines, strengthening cold chain systems, improving coverage with existing vaccines, and addressing vaccine hesitancy. The COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in routine immunization services, with millions of children missing vaccines, requiring catch-up campaigns to restore coverage and prevent outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.\nEmerging infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness have received increased attention following SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. The WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, established in 2016, consolidates the organization’s capacity to detect, assess, and respond to disease outbreaks and humanitarian emergencies. The program operates emergency operations centers, deploys rapid response teams, coordinates international assistance, and provides technical guidance during outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, tested the organization’s emergency response capacity at unprecedented scale. The WHO provided technical guidance on case detection, clinical management, and infection prevention and control; coordinated research efforts; and launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) partnership to accelerate development, production, and equitable distribution of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines."

    "text": "Noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes have emerged as the leading causes of mortality globally, responsible for approximately seventy percent of deaths. The WHO’s response to noncommunicable diseases evolved more slowly than its communicable disease programs, reflecting historical emphasis on infectious diseases and the perception that chronic diseases were primarily problems of wealthy countries. The political declaration on noncommunicable diseases adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011 represented a turning point, recognizing that these diseases impede social and economic development and require coordinated international action.\nThe WHO’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2030 established voluntary global targets including a twenty-five percent relative reduction in premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases by 2025, later extended to a thirty percent reduction by 2030. The action plan identifies cost-effective interventions termed “best buys” that provide high return on investment and are feasible for all countries. These interventions address risk factors including tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which entered into force in 2005, represents the organization’s first treaty and establishes comprehensive tobacco control measures including taxation, smoke-free policies, health warnings, bans on advertising and promotion, and support for cessation.\nThe WHO’s efforts to address unhealthy diet and physical inactivity include recommendations on sugar, salt, and saturated fat intake; guidelines on physical activity for different age groups; and support for countries implementing policies such as sugar-sweetened beverage taxes, front-of-package labeling, restrictions on marketing unhealthy foods to children, and urban design that promotes active transportation. The global strategy on diet, physical activity, and health, adopted in 2004, called for multisectoral action engaging not only health sectors but also agriculture, education, trade, and urban planning. Implementation has faced challenges including opposition from food and beverage industries and limited political will in some countries to adopt regulatory measures.\nMental health, neurological disorders, and substance use disorders collectively affect hundreds of millions of people globally yet have historically received inadequate attention and resources, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The WHO’s Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 aims to promote mental wellbeing, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights, and reduce mortality and morbidity. The mhGAP (Mental Health Gap Action Programme) provides evidence-based guidelines and tools for delivering mental health interventions in non-specialized health settings, addressing the shortage of mental health specialists in many countries. The program covers priority conditions including depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, developmental disorders in children, behavioral disorders, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, and self-harm and suicide.\nCancer control efforts address a group of diseases that kill approximately ten million people annually. The WHO’s cancer programs promote comprehensive cancer control including prevention through reduction of risk factors such as tobacco use, vaccination against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B which cause cervical and liver cancers respectively, early detection through screening programs for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers, treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and palliative care for advanced disease. The organization’s work on access to pain relief medications addresses the global imbalance where most controlled medicines are available in high-income countries while patients in many low- and middle-income countries lack access to essential pain control, particularly morphine for cancer pain."

    "text": "The WHO’s work on health systems addresses the foundational structures and functions that enable delivery of health services. The health systems framework identifies six building blocks: service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership and governance. Strengthening health systems requires attention to each component and their interactions, recognizing that weakness in one area can undermine overall system performance. The Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care, adopted at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 1978, established primary health care as the key to achieving health for all. The declaration emphasized comprehensive primary health care encompassing promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services as close as possible to where people live and work, delivered through participatory approaches engaging communities in health decisions.\nUniversal health coverage has emerged as a central organizing principle for health systems development, embodied in Sustainable Development Goal target 3.8 which aims to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, ensuring that all people have access to needed health services without financial hardship. The WHO defines universal health coverage as requiring that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. This requires sufficiently strong health systems, financing arrangements that prevent impoverishment from health expenses, and prioritization of essential services based on evidence and ethics.\nThe WHO’s work on health financing promotes domestic resource mobilization, efficient allocation and use of resources, and financial protection mechanisms such as health insurance and other prepayment schemes that pool risks across populations. The organization analyzes health expenditure patterns, tracks out-of-pocket payments that cause financial hardship, and provides technical support for countries designing or reforming health financing systems. The emphasis has shifted from focusing solely on increasing overall health spending to ensuring that resources are used effectively and equitably, reaching underserved populations and addressing priority health needs.\nHuman resources for health constitute a critical constraint for many health systems. The global health workforce shortage, particularly of doctors, nurses, and midwives in low- and middle-income countries, limits capacity to expand service coverage. The WHO’s Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health provides a framework for addressing workforce challenges through improving production of health workers, retaining workers particularly in underserved areas, and ensuring supportive work environments with adequate remuneration, career development opportunities, and decent working conditions. The organization also addresses health worker migration through the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, which establishes ethical principles for recruitment while recognizing the rights of health workers to migrate.\nQuality of care has received increased attention as evidence accumulated that even when services are available and accessible, poor quality can prevent achievement of health outcomes. The WHO defines quality of care as health care that is effective, safe, people-centered, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. The organization develops technical standards and guidelines for quality improvement, supports countries in implementing quality assurance programs, and promotes patient safety initiatives addressing adverse events, medication errors, health care-associated infections, and other threats to safety."

    "text": "The WHO’s programs addressing reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health aim to reduce preventable deaths and ensure healthy development throughout the life course. Despite substantial progress over recent decades, approximately 287,000 women still die annually from pregnancy and childbirth complications, 2.4 million newborns die in their first month of life, and 5.2 million children under age five die, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries and being preventable with known interventions.\nThe Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health provides a framework for action across three objectives: survive by ending preventable deaths, thrive by ensuring health and wellbeing, and transform by expanding enabling environments. The strategy promotes evidence-based interventions delivered across the continuum of care from pre-pregnancy through pregnancy, childbirth, the postnatal period, and childhood. Key interventions include antenatal care, skilled attendance at delivery, emergency obstetric care, postnatal care, exclusive breastfeeding, immunization, management of childhood illnesses, and adolescent health services addressing sexual and reproductive health, mental health, nutrition, and prevention of injuries and violence.\nThe WHO’s work on sexual and reproductive health addresses family planning, maternal health, prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, prevention of unsafe abortion, and management of reproductive health problems such as infertility and reproductive tract cancers. The organization advocates for a human rights-based approach that respects reproductive autonomy and ensures access to information and services without discrimination. The program emphasizes that sexual and reproductive health and rights are integral to health systems and essential for achieving universal health coverage.\nNutrition programs address both undernutrition including stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. The WHO’s nutrition guidance covers infant and young child feeding including promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and appropriate complementary feeding; micronutrient supplementation and food fortification; management of severe acute malnutrition; and prevention and management of overweight and obesity. The organization works with countries to develop nutrition policies and programs, improve nutrition surveillance, and strengthen capacity for nutrition action across sectors including health, agriculture, education, and social protection."

The WHO estimates that environmental risk factors contribute to approximately one quarter of the global disease burden. The organization’s environmental health programs address air pollution, both outdoor air pollution from industry, transportation, and energy production, and household air pollution from use of polluting fuels for cooking and heating. Air pollution causes approximately seven million premature deaths annually through cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. The WHO’s air quality guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations on pollutant levels to protect health and serve as reference for national standards and policy development.\nWater, sanitation, and hygiene remain fundamental health determinants, with inadequate services causing diarrheal disease, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, and contributing to malnutrition and stunting. Despite progress, billions of people still lack safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The WHO collaborates with governments and partners to strengthen water quality surveillance, promote safe sanitation technologies, and integrate water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions into health programs addressing maternal and child health, nutrition, and neglected tropical diseases.\nChemical safety programs address occupational and environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals including pesticides, industrial chemicals, and chemicals in consumer products. The WHO conducts health risk assessments for chemicals, develops guidance on chemical exposure limits, and supports countries in strengthening chemical safety management. Lead poisoning, mercury exposure, pesticide poisoning, and asbestos-related diseases represent significant but often preventable health burdens.\nClimate change poses mounting threats to health through multiple pathways including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, changing patterns of vector-borne diseases as geographic ranges of mosquitoes and other vectors expand, impacts on food security and nutrition, water scarcity, and population displacement. The WHO’s climate and health program aims to strengthen health sector capacity to protect populations from climate risks through climate-resilient health systems, surveillance for climate-sensitive health outcomes, promotion of mitigation measures that also improve health such as active transportation and clean energy, and incorporation of health considerations into climate change adaptation plans."

The International Health Regulations provide the legal framework for health security, but implementation requires substantial national capacity for surveillance, laboratory confirmation, risk assessment, and response coordination. The WHO supports countries in building core capacities through the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and joint external evaluations that assess preparedness levels and identify gaps requiring investment.\nThe Research and Development Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, launched in 2015, aims to accelerate development of medical countermeasures for diseases with epidemic potential that lack adequate tools. The blueprint identifies priority diseases based on epidemic potential and absence of effective interventions, and works to accelerate research and development through coordinated action among researchers, funders, and developers. Target disease profile development, clinical trial networks, and regulatory pathway guidance seek to reduce time from pathogen identification to deployment of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed both strengths and weaknesses in global health security architecture. The WHO’s early risk assessments, technical guidance development, and coordination of scientific research demonstrated its technical capacity and convening power. However, delays in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, variable quality of guidance on mask use and other interventions as evidence evolved, and challenges in the ACT-Accelerator particularly regarding vaccine equity attracted criticism. The pandemic exposed fundamental tensions between national sovereignty and global solidarity, with countries prioritizing domestic populations over equitable international distribution of scarce vaccines and other countermeasures. Proposals for reform include strengthening the WHO’s investigative authority during disease outbreaks, creating sustainable financing for pandemic preparedness, and developing binding mechanisms to ensure equitable access to medical countermeasures during health emergencies."

The Health Cluster coordination mechanism brings together humanitarian organizations to ensure comprehensive health response avoiding gaps and duplication.\nEmergencies create particular vulnerabilities for women, children, persons with disabilities, and older people who may face barriers to accessing services and increased risks of violence, exploitation, and neglect. Emergency health response must address both injuries and trauma directly caused by crises and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions when routine care is disrupted. Mental health and psychosocial support constitute essential components of humanitarian health response, addressing traumatic stress, grief, family separation, and threats to safety and dignity.\nThe Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) collects and disseminates information on health facilities and services in countries affected by emergencies, enabling response actors to identify functional health facilities, gaps in service coverage, and priority needs for health system recovery. The WHO’s Emergency Medical Teams initiative establishes standards for clinical teams deployed internationally to provide surgical, trauma, and critical care during emergencies, ensuring quality and accountability of foreign medical teams."

    "text": "The WHO faces significant challenges in fulfilling its mandate in the contemporary global health landscape. Geopolitical tensions affect the organization’s functioning, with member states sometimes prioritizing national interests over collective action and using the WHO as an arena for broader political conflicts. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified such tensions, with the United States temporarily withdrawing from the WHO in 2020 over allegations of Chinese influence and mishandling of the pandemic response. Although the United States rejoined in 2021, the episode highlighted the organization’s vulnerability to great power politics.\nFunding constraints limit the WHO’s ability to adequately address the breadth of health challenges within its mandate. The dependence on voluntary contributions and their earmarking for donor priorities rather than WHO priorities as determined through its governance structures raises questions about whether the organization can maintain strategic coherence and independence. Proposals for funding reform including increasing assessed contributions have made limited progress due to member state reluctance to increase mandatory financial obligations without assurances of improved efficiency and results.\nThe proliferation of global health actors including vertical disease programs, public-private partnerships, philanthropic foundations, and civil society organizations has created a crowded and fragmented global health architecture. While this pluralism brings resources and innovation, it also creates coordination challenges and potential for duplication or gaps. The WHO’s role as coordinator is complicated when it depends financially on some of the same actors it is meant to coordinate. Questions arise about whether the WHO should prioritize normative work, providing global public goods through standard-setting and technical guidance, or whether it should also maintain significant operational capacity for country support and emergency response.\nCriticisms of the WHO’s performance have come from various directions. Some argue the organization is too bureaucratic and slow to respond to emerging challenges, citing delays in declaring public health emergencies and updating guidance as evidence evolves. Others contend the WHO has been captured by pharmaceutical interests or wealthy donors who shape the agenda toward interventions that benefit industry rather than addressing social determinants of health. The organization has also faced criticism for insufficient attention to equity and human rights, with some pointing to gaps between the values espoused in WHO documents and the accessibility of services and technologies in practice.\nThe tension between the WHO’s technical and political functions creates inherent challenges. As a technical agency, the WHO should provide objective scientific guidance based on evidence. As an intergovernmental organization, it must operate through consensus among member states with diverse perspectives and interests. When scientific evidence points toward recommendations that some member states oppose for political, economic, or cultural reasons, the WHO must navigate between scientific integrity and political feasibility. This tension appears in debates over sexual and reproductive health, harm reduction approaches to drug use, health consequences of conflict and occupation, and numerous other issues where evidence and politics may diverge."

    "text": "Ongoing discussions about the future of global health governance and the WHO’s role within it address several key themes. Strengthening pandemic preparedness and response capacity includes proposals for a new international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response that would establish binding commitments on surveillance, information sharing, equitable access to medical countermeasures, and financing. Negotiations on this pandemic accord have proven contentious, with divisions over intellectual property provisions, financing obligations, and the balance between national sovereignty and international solidarity.\nSustainable financing reform seeks to increase the proportion of the WHO’s budget from assessed contributions, which would provide more flexible and predictable resources and reduce dependence on earmarked voluntary contributions. The WHO has proposed gradually increasing assessed contributions and replenishing the reserves for health emergencies. However, meaningful reform requires member state agreement to increase their financial commitments, which faces political resistance in many countries.\nDigital health technologies offer opportunities for expanding service reach, improving data collection and use, and enabling new models of care delivery. The WHO has developed strategies and guidance on digital health, addressing topics including mobile health interventions, telemedicine, artificial intelligence in health care, and digital health data governance. Ensuring that digital health technologies reduce rather than exacerbate inequalities requires attention to digital literacy, connectivity infrastructure, and policies that protect privacy and prevent misuse of health data.\nThe shift toward multisectoral action to address health determinants beyond the health sector reflects recognition that many health outcomes are shaped by factors including education, housing, employment, food systems, and environmental conditions. The Health in All Policies approach promotes consideration of health implications in policy decisions across government sectors. However, implementing multisectoral action faces challenges including competing sector priorities, lack of mechanisms for cross-sector coordination, and difficulties attributing health outcomes to specific policy actions.\nAddressing health inequalities within and between countries remains a central challenge requiring attention to the social, economic, and political determinants that create systematic differences in health opportunities and outcomes. The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health documented how inequitable distribution of power, income, goods, and services shapes health and produced the 2008 report “Closing the Gap in a Generation” with recommendations for action on health equity. Implementation requires political will to address structural inequalities and power dynamics that maintain health disparities."

    "text": "The World Health Organization stands at a critical juncture after more than seventy-five years of existence. The COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously demonstrated the indispensable value of global health coordination and exposed significant limitations in the current architecture. The WHO’s technical expertise, normative authority, and convening power remain essential assets for addressing health challenges that transcend borders and exceed the capacity of any single nation to solve. Yet the organization’s ability to fulfill its constitutional mandate of helping all peoples attain the highest possible level of health depends on resolving fundamental tensions around financing, governance, and the balance between national sovereignty and collective action.\nThe epidemiological transition, whereby noncommunicable diseases have become leading causes of death globally while new infectious diseases continue to emerge and established infections remain major problems in many settings, requires the WHO to maintain broad programmatic scope. Climate change, demographic aging, urbanization, and globalization create new health challenges requiring innovative approaches. Advances in biomedical science offer unprecedented opportunities for disease prevention and treatment but also raise complex ethical questions about equity, access, and appropriate use of new technologies.\nThe health impacts of conflict, forced migration, environmental degradation, and economic inequality demonstrate that health security and health equity are intertwined and that neither can be achieved without addressing fundamental political and economic structures. The WHO operates within a global system characterized by deep power asymmetries and competing interests, limiting what any international organization can accomplish without sustained political commitment from member states.\nNevertheless, the WHO’s history demonstrates the potential for international cooperation to achieve significant health gains. The eradication of smallpox, expansion of immunization coverage saving millions of lives, development of clinical guidelines improving care worldwide, and coordinated responses to disease outbreaks represent meaningful accomplishments. The Sustainable Development Goals’ aspiration for universal health coverage by 2030, while unlikely to be fully achieved on that timeline, provides a vision and framework for action toward health systems that serve all people without financial hardship.\nStrengthening the WHO and global health governance more broadly requires confronting difficult questions about priorities, resources, accountability, and the distribution of benefits and burdens in global health cooperation. It requires moving beyond narrow biomedical approaches to address the social, environmental, and political determinants that fundamentally shape population health. It requires building trust through transparency, inclusion of diverse perspectives and knowledge systems, and demonstrated commitment to equity. Most fundamentally, it requires recognition that in an interconnected world, health anywhere depends on health everywhere, and that effective responses to shared health threats require collective action grounded in solidarity, not merely enlightened self-interest.\nThe next chapter in the WHO’s evolution will be written through the choices that member states, civil society, and other stakeholders make about the kind of global health system they wish to create and the resources and political commitment they are willing to invest in that vision. The technical knowledge and tools exist to dramatically improve health outcomes worldwide, but translating that potential into reality requires confronting the political and economic barriers that perpetuate health inequalities and limit collective action. The WHO’s future effectiveness depends not only on internal reforms but on fundamental changes in how the international community approaches global health as a shared responsibility and public good requiring sustained cooperation and mutual accountability."

    "text": "The Foundation Period: From Rome to Maastricht (1957-1992)\nThe Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community in 1957 contained no explicit provisions for health policy. The founding member states conceived of European integration primarily in economic terms, focused on creating a common market and customs union. Health systems, deeply rooted in national traditions and political systems, remained firmly under national control. The early decades of European integration saw health issues addressed only indirectly through provisions related to the free movement of workers and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.\nThe primary health-related activities during this period concerned occupational health and safety. The treaty provisions on working conditions provided a legal basis for directives addressing workplace hazards, exposure to dangerous substances, and health protection for specific categories of workers. Additionally, the recognition that healthcare professionals must be able to move freely within the common market led to directives on the mutual recognition of medical, nursing, and other health professional qualifications. These measures, while important, represented a narrow conception of health policy focused on removing barriers to economic integration rather than pursuing health as an intrinsic policy goal.\nThe Single European Act of 1986 marked a modest expansion of health-related provisions, introducing specific requirements for health and safety protection in the workplace and laying the groundwork for more systematic attention to health matters. However, the act maintained the fundamentally national character of health policy, with Community action limited to supporting and complementing member state initiatives."

    "text": "The Maastricht Treaty and the Establishment of Health Competence (1992)\nThe Treaty on European Union, signed at Maastricht in 1992, represented a watershed moment for EU health policy. Article 129 of the treaty, subsequently renumbered as Article 168 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, established for the first time an explicit legal basis for Community action in public health. The article stated that the Community should contribute to ensuring a high level of human health protection by encouraging cooperation between member states and, if necessary, lending support to their action. Crucially, the treaty specified that Community action should be directed toward improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness, and obviating sources of danger to human health.\nThe Maastricht provisions incorporated two fundamental principles that continue to shape EU health policy. First, the principle of subsidiarity was explicitly enshrined, establishing that the EU should act only where objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states acting alone and can be better achieved at Union level. This principle reflects the recognition that healthcare organization and delivery remain essentially national responsibilities, shaped by distinct historical traditions, financing mechanisms, and political choices. Second, the treaty explicitly excluded the harmonization of laws and regulations of member states in the health field, meaning that the EU cannot impose uniform health policies or require member states to standardize their health systems.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the Maastricht Treaty opened new possibilities for EU action in public health. The establishment of health programs, the collection and analysis of health data, the promotion of research, and the encouragement of cooperation in addressing common health challenges all became legitimate EU activities. The treaty thus created a framework for meaningful EU involvement in health while respecting national prerogatives over healthcare systems."

    "text": "From Amsterdam to Lisbon: Strengthening Health Protection (1997-2009)\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force in 1999, built upon the Maastricht foundations by introducing the principle of health protection into all Community policies. The treaty stipulated that a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities, thereby establishing what came to be known as the Health in All Policies approach. This principle recognizes that health outcomes are determined not only by health services but also by social determinants including education, employment, environment, agriculture, transport, and other policy domains. By requiring health considerations to be integrated across all EU policy areas, the Amsterdam Treaty acknowledged the multifaceted nature of health and the need for policy coherence.\nSubsequent years saw the gradual expansion of EU health activities within this constitutional framework. Public health programs addressing specific issues such as cancer, AIDS, drug dependence, and health promotion were established and provided funding for collaborative projects between member states. The EU also began to develop regulatory frameworks for cross-border health issues, including standards for blood and blood products, human tissues and cells, and organ transplantation. These measures reflected growing recognition that certain health risks require coordinated action beyond national borders.\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009, consolidated and strengthened EU health provisions. The treaty maintained the core principles established at Maastricht while adding new dimensions to EU health competence. Importantly, Lisbon enhanced provisions related to cross-border health threats, authorizing the Union to adopt measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and medical devices, and measures concerning monitoring, early warning, and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The treaty thus provided a stronger legal foundation for EU action on health security and emergency preparedness, though these provisions would not be fully utilized until the COVID-19 pandemic more than a decade later."

    "text": "The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Push for a European Health Union (2020-Present)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in early 2020 exposed both the strengths and limitations of existing EU health collaboration mechanisms. The initial months of the pandemic saw uncoordinated national responses, including border closures, competition for scarce medical supplies, and varying public health measures that sometimes worked at cross-purposes. The crisis demonstrated that health threats of such magnitude cannot be adequately addressed through voluntary cooperation alone, and that stronger coordination mechanisms and greater EU-level capacity are needed to respond effectively to health emergencies.\nIn response to these challenges, the EU undertook its most significant expansion of health activities since the Maastricht Treaty. In 2021, the European Commission established the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, known as HERA, to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to health emergencies. HERA’s mandate includes threat assessment, intelligence gathering, development and procurement of medical countermeasures, and coordination of emergency response. The establishment of HERA represents a qualitative shift toward greater EU capacity in health security, moving beyond purely coordinating functions to include operational responsibilities for stockpiling, procurement, and ensuring the availability of critical medical supplies.\nThe pandemic also led to a substantial strengthening of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Previously limited to providing scientific advice and conducting surveillance, ECDC received an enhanced mandate including the authority to activate the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan, conduct epidemiological investigations in member states, and support the development and deployment of medical countermeasures. These changes reflect lessons learned about the need for strong, authoritative scientific guidance during health emergencies.\nPerhaps most significantly, the pandemic catalyzed political momentum for what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen termed a “European Health Union.” This concept envisions a more integrated approach to health policy while maintaining respect for national competences over healthcare organization. The Health Union framework includes not only enhanced emergency preparedness and response mechanisms but also ambitious initiatives in areas such as cancer control, mental health, pharmaceutical policy, and digital health infrastructure. While the legal foundations of this Health Union rest on existing treaty provisions, the political commitment and financial resources dedicated to health have increased dramatically compared to the pre-pandemic era."

    "text": "Nature and Structure of the European Union\nTo understand EU health policy, it is essential to grasp the broader constitutional framework within which health collaboration occurs. The European Union is a unique political entity that combines supranational and intergovernmental elements. It is neither a traditional international organization where states retain full sovereignty nor a federal state where sovereignty is definitively transferred to central institutions. Rather, the EU represents a novel form of political organization in which member states have pooled sovereignty in specific policy areas while retaining autonomy in others.\nAs of 2025, the European Union comprises twenty-seven member states with a combined population of approximately 450 million citizens. The Union operates on the basis of the treaties voluntarily agreed by member states, which function as a constitutional framework defining the scope and limits of EU competence. The principle of conferral stipulates that the EU can act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by member states through the treaties. Any competences not conferred on the Union remain with member states.\nThe EU constitutional framework distinguishes between three types of competence. Exclusive competences are policy areas where only the EU may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, with member states able to do so only if empowered by the EU or for the implementation of EU acts. These areas include the customs union, competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market, monetary policy for euro area member states, and conservation of marine biological resources. Shared competences are areas where both the EU and member states may legislate and adopt legally binding acts. Member states exercise their competence to the extent that the EU has not exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence. Shared competences include the internal market, social policy, economic and social cohesion, agriculture and fisheries, environment, consumer protection, and transport. Supporting competences are areas where the EU may carry out actions to support, coordinate, or supplement member state actions, but cannot harmonize member state laws. Health, along with education, culture, tourism, vocational training, youth, sport, and civil protection, falls into this third category."

    "section": "The Subsidiarity Principle in Health Policy",
    "text": "The Subsidiarity Principle in Health Policy\nThe classification of health as a supporting competence reflects the principle of subsidiarity, which is particularly important in understanding EU health policy. Subsidiarity holds that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen, and that action at Union level should only be undertaken when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states acting alone and can be better achieved at Union level. In the health context, this means that the organization, financing, and delivery of healthcare services remain national responsibilities, while the EU may act in areas where coordinated action yields benefits that individual member states cannot achieve independently.\nThe application of subsidiarity in health manifests in several ways. The EU may facilitate cooperation between member states, provide platforms for exchanging best practices, fund collaborative projects, and establish common frameworks for addressing issues with inherent cross-border dimensions. However, the EU cannot require member states to organize their health systems in particular ways, set binding standards for healthcare quality beyond specific technical areas, or dictate how national health budgets should be allocated. This constraint means that EU health policy operates primarily through soft coordination mechanisms, financial incentives, and regulatory standards in areas with clear cross-border implications."

The Treaty stipulates that a high level of human health protection must be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. This requirement reflects the understanding that policies in areas such as agriculture, environment, transport, employment, and trade all have significant health implications.\nImplementing Health in All Policies requires mechanisms for assessing health impacts of proposed policies, integrating health considerations into decision-making processes across sectors, and building partnerships between health and non-health actors. At the EU level, this includes health impact assessments of major legislative proposals, inter-service consultation processes within the European Commission, and dedicated efforts to address health in specific policy areas such as environmental regulation, food safety standards, and chemical legislation. The effectiveness of Health in All Policies depends not only on formal procedures but also on institutional culture, political commitment, and the capacity to identify and articulate health implications of policies that may not have obvious health connections."

    "text": "Primary Legal Basis: Article 168 TFEU\nThe primary legal foundation for EU health policy is Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This article, originally introduced by the Maastricht Treaty as Article 129 and subsequently renumbered, establishes both the scope and the limits of EU competence in health matters. Understanding this article is essential for grasping what the EU can and cannot do in the health field.\nArticle 168 begins by establishing that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, is to be directed toward improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. The article specifies several mechanisms through which the Union and member states should foster cooperation, including initiatives to set high standards of quality and safety, measures in veterinary and phytosanitary fields with health protection as a direct objective, and measures concerning monitoring, early warning of, and combating serious cross-border threats to health.\nCritically, Article 168 explicitly states that Union action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of member states for the definition of their health policy and for the organization and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of member states include the management of health services and medical care, and the allocation of resources assigned to health services and medical care. The paragraph further specifies that measures adopted pursuant to Article 168 shall not prevent member states from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures compatible with the treaties.\nThe article authorizes the European Parliament and Council to adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health, and in particular to combat major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of, and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use. However, the article explicitly excludes any harmonization of laws and regulations of member states in these areas. The Council may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in Article 168, though such recommendations are not legally binding.\nThis legal framework creates a nuanced space for EU action. The EU can establish common standards in specific technical areas such as pharmaceutical regulation and medical device safety, coordinate responses to cross-border health threats, fund health projects and programs, facilitate information exchange and best practice sharing, and promote health considerations across all policy domains. What the EU cannot do is harmonize national health laws, impose uniform health system structures, dictate national healthcare budgets or priorities, or interfere with member states’ fundamental choices about healthcare organization and financing."

    "text": "Cross-Border Healthcare Legislation\nOne of the most significant pieces of EU health legislation is Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. This directive, adopted after years of negotiation and building on case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union, establishes a framework for patients seeking healthcare in member states other than their country of affiliation. The directive recognizes that while healthcare remains a national competence, the principles of free movement require that patients have the right to access healthcare in other member states under certain conditions.\nThe directive establishes that patients have the right to receive healthcare in another member state and to be reimbursed for that care up to the level that would have been provided by their home member state. Patients are not required to seek prior authorization for most types of care, though member states may maintain prior authorization requirements for hospital care or highly specialized treatments that meet certain criteria. The directive also establishes that the healthcare provider is responsible for the quality and safety of care provided, while the patient’s home member state is responsible for reimbursement.\nBeyond individual patient mobility, Directive 2011/24/EU also established frameworks for cooperation between member states on healthcare issues. These include provisions for European Reference Networks, which are virtual networks connecting healthcare providers across Europe to share expertise on rare and complex conditions. The directive also addresses mutual recognition of prescriptions issued in other member states, cooperation on health technology assessment, and mechanisms for sharing information about healthcare providers and patient rights. While the directive has been criticized for complexity and limited impact on actual patient mobility, it represents an important recognition of the cross-border dimensions of healthcare in an integrated Europe."

    "text": "Pharmaceutical Regulation\nThe EU has developed extensive regulatory frameworks for medicinal products, reflecting the recognition that the safety, quality, and efficacy of medicines are matters of common interest that benefit from coordinated approaches. The regulatory system operates through two complementary mechanisms: a centralized authorization procedure managed by the European Medicines Agency, and decentralized and mutual recognition procedures coordinated between national medicines agencies.\nRegulation 726/2004 establishes the centralized procedure, which is mandatory for certain categories of medicines including those derived from biotechnology processes, orphan medicinal products for rare diseases, advanced therapy medicinal products, and medicines for human use containing new active substances for specific therapeutic areas. For these products, a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission based on EMA assessment is valid throughout the European Union. This centralized system ensures uniform scientific standards, avoids duplication of assessment efforts, and facilitates access to innovative medicines across the EU.\nThe Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, codified in Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, establishes comprehensive requirements for the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines, manufacturing standards, labeling and packaging requirements, advertising restrictions, and pharmacovigilance obligations. The directive has been amended numerous times to address emerging issues such as falsified medicines, the regulation of herbal medicinal products, and enhanced pharmacovigilance requirements following safety scandals.\nClinical trials of medicinal products are governed by Regulation 536/2014, which replaced the previous Clinical Trials Directive. The regulation aims to simplify procedures, harmonize assessment processes across member states, and increase transparency through a publicly accessible EU database of clinical trials. The regulation establishes a coordinated assessment procedure whereby sponsors submit a single application through an EU portal, with one member state serving as reporting member state coordinating the assessment. This system is designed to facilitate multinational clinical trials while maintaining high ethical and safety standards.\nPharmaceutical regulation represents an area where the EU has successfully balanced the need for coordinated action with respect for national competences. While authorization, safety monitoring, and quality standards are significantly harmonized, pricing and reimbursement decisions remain national competences. Member states retain the authority to decide which medicines to include in their national health insurance systems and at what price, though the EU facilitates voluntary cooperation on health technology assessment to support these decisions."

These regulations, which replaced earlier directives, established significantly more stringent requirements for medical devices based on lessons learned from safety scandals and recognition of gaps in the previous system.\nThe medical devices regulations introduce more rigorous clinical evidence requirements, particularly for high-risk devices. Manufacturers must provide more extensive clinical data demonstrating safety and performance, and the regulations strengthen requirements for post-market surveillance and vigilance. The regulations establish a Unique Device Identification system to improve traceability of devices throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing through distribution to use in clinical settings. The regulations also introduced more stringent requirements for notified bodies, the independent organizations that assess device conformity, including more intensive oversight and mandatory unannounced audits.\nThe medical devices regulations exemplify the EU’s approach to balancing innovation with patient safety. While the regulations are more demanding than their predecessors, they maintain a risk-based approach that avoids unnecessarily burdening lower-risk devices with requirements designed for high-risk implantable devices. The regulations also include provisions to support innovation, such as innovation offices within notified bodies and provisions for custom-made devices and devices manufactured in health institutions."

The system enables rapid exchange of information and coordination of response measures. The decision also provides for risk assessment by relevant EU agencies, development of preparedness and response plans, and coordination of risk communication. While member states retain primary responsibility for protecting public health on their territories, the decision creates obligations for notification and cooperation that strengthen collective capacity to address threats that transcend borders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to further strengthening of health security provisions. Regulations adopted in 2022 expanded the mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to include enhanced surveillance capabilities, authority to conduct epidemiological investigations in member states in coordination with national authorities, and responsibilities for supporting preparedness planning and response coordination. These regulations also established the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan, providing a framework for coordinated EU-level action during health crises while respecting member state competences."

The directive aims to ensure high standards of protection for blood donors and recipients while facilitating exchange of blood and blood components between member states where necessary to meet clinical needs.\nSimilarly, Directive 2004/23/EC establishes standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells. The directive covers a wide range of applications from reproductive medicine to bone and skin grafting, establishing requirements for tissue establishments, donor selection, testing protocols, and traceability systems. Directive 2010/53/EU extends similar frameworks to organ transplantation, establishing quality and safety standards for organs intended for transplantation.\nThese directives reflect the recognition that substances of human origin present unique regulatory challenges, combining medical device and pharmaceutical characteristics with ethical considerations specific to human-derived materials. The EU framework aims to ensure safety and quality while respecting principles such as voluntary unpaid donation, anonymity of donors and recipients, and solidarity in the allocation of scarce organs."

The directive prohibits misleading descriptors such as “light” or “mild” and restricts characterizing flavors that make tobacco products more attractive, particularly to young people. The directive also establishes regulatory frameworks for electronic cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations, safety and quality requirements, and restrictions on advertising.\nMember states have implemented the directive’s minimum standards while some have adopted more stringent measures permitted under EU law, including plain packaging requirements and display bans at point of sale. The EU framework on tobacco control demonstrates how public health considerations can justify significant regulatory intervention in a commercial sector, though always within the bounds of treaty provisions and subject to scrutiny regarding proportionality and evidence basis."

ENVI examines legislative proposals in the health field, drafts reports with proposed amendments, holds hearings with experts and stakeholders, and votes on whether to recommend adoption of legislation to the full Parliament.\nThe Parliament has gradually expanded its role in health policy as successive treaty reforms have extended the co-decision procedure to more policy areas. Under the ordinary legislative procedure now applied to most health legislation, the Parliament and Council must agree on identical texts for legislation to be adopted. This gives the Parliament significant influence over the content and direction of EU health policy, though always within the framework of Commission proposals and in negotiation with member states through the Council.\nMembers of the European Parliament from different member states and political groups bring diverse perspectives to health policy debates. While the Parliament generally supports ambitious health initiatives and often pushes for stronger provisions than proposed by the Commission or sought by the Council, MEPs must also be attentive to concerns about subsidiarity and national competences.

The technical expertise of working party members, combined with their understanding of national contexts, shapes the practical implementation of EU health initiatives.\nDecision-making in the Council on health matters generally uses qualified majority voting, meaning that proposals can be adopted without unanimous support if they receive support from member states representing at least 55% of member states and 65% of the EU population. However, particularly sensitive health issues may require consensus, and member states that object strongly to particular provisions can seek to protect national interests.

The agency operates through scientific committees that assess medicines based on quality, safety, and efficacy data provided by applicants.\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use evaluates medicines for human use, while the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee assesses safety issues, and the Committee for Advanced Therapies evaluates novel therapies based on genes, tissues, or cells. Additional committees address orphan medicines, pediatric medicines, and herbal medicinal products. These committees comprise experts nominated by member states, ensuring that authorization decisions benefit from the best available scientific expertise across Europe.\nEMA’s role extends beyond initial authorization to include monitoring medicines throughout their lifecycle. Post-authorization safety monitoring through the European pharmacovigilance system collects and analyzes adverse reaction reports from healthcare professionals, patients, and pharmaceutical companies. When new safety concerns arise, EMA can require label changes, impose restrictions on use, or in serious cases recommend suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization. This comprehensive approach to medicine regulation aims to ensure that medicines available in Europe meet consistently high standards.\nThe agency also plays an important role in facilitating access to medicines. Scientific advice programs provide guidance to developers on clinical trial design and data requirements, potentially accelerating development of promising therapies. Accelerated assessment procedures allow faster evaluation of medicines addressing unmet medical needs, while conditional authorizations enable early access to promising medicines when comprehensive data are not yet available. These mechanisms reflect efforts to balance rapid access to innovation with maintenance of high safety and efficacy standards."

During outbreaks, ECDC can deploy rapid assistance teams to support affected member states with field epidemiology, laboratory investigation, and control measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to significant expansion of ECDC’s mandate and resources. Regulations adopted in 2022 enhanced ECDC’s capacity to coordinate surveillance, strengthened its role in preparedness planning including reviews of national preparedness plans, and provided authority to activate the EU Health Crisis and Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan during emergencies. These changes reflect recognition that stronger central scientific capacity is needed to support coordinated responses to major health threats while respecting member state authority over public health measures.\nECDC also supports training of public health professionals through the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, which provides practical training in outbreak investigation and applied epidemiology. This fellowship program helps build capacity across Europe while creating networks of professionals who can collaborate effectively during cross-border health threats. The centre additionally provides guidance on prevention measures, publishes technical documents on disease-specific topics, and conducts research on emerging public health challenges."

    "text": "Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority\nThe Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, known as HERA, was established in 2021 as part of the EU response to lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike traditional EU agencies, HERA is established within the European Commission structure but operates with significant autonomy and dedicated resources for health emergency preparedness and response.\nHERA’s mandate encompasses the full cycle of health emergency management from prevention and preparedness through response and recovery. In preparedness mode, which represents its normal operating state, HERA conducts threat assessments, gathers intelligence on potential health threats, supports research and development of medical countermeasures, addresses potential supply chain vulnerabilities, and maintains strategic stockpiles of critical medical supplies. The authority works with member states, EU agencies, industry, and international partners to strengthen Europe’s collective preparedness for health emergencies.\nA key innovation of HERA is its focus on medical countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and personal protective equipment. HERA aims to avoid the supply shortages, competition between member states, and dependence on external suppliers that characterized early pandemic response. The authority facilitates advance purchase agreements with manufacturers to secure supplies, supports development of novel countermeasures through research funding, and works to maintain European manufacturing capacity for critical medical products through the EU FAB network concept.\nWhen the Commission activates emergency mode in response to a recognized health crisis, HERA shifts to emergency operations with enhanced authority and resources. In emergency mode, HERA can trigger rapid procurement procedures, activate emergency medical countermeasure development, coordinate distribution of supplies, and mobilize additional financing. This dual-mode structure aims to ensure sustained attention to preparedness while enabling rapid response when emergencies occur.\nHERA’s establishment represents a significant evolution in EU health policy, moving beyond purely coordinating functions to include operational capacity for ensuring medical supply security. This reflects recognition that effective pandemic preparedness requires not only coordination but also concrete measures to maintain manufacturing capacity, secure supplies, and support innovation. The authority’s success will depend on sustained political and financial commitment beyond the immediate post-pandemic period."

With €5.3 billion allocated for 2021-2027, EU4Health commands resources more than tenfold greater than the previous health programme. This dramatic increase reflects the political momentum generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed vulnerabilities in health systems and prompted recognition that stronger EU-level capacity is needed to address cross-border health challenges.\nThe programme emerged from the Commission’s proposal in May 2020 for a €9.4 billion health programme as part of the recovery from COVID-19. After negotiations between the Parliament, Council, and Commission, the final budget was set at €5.3 billion, still representing unprecedented investment in EU health activities. The increase reflects both the urgent need to strengthen health security following pandemic experiences and political will to develop a stronger health dimension to European integration.\nEU4Health establishes four general objectives that structure all programme activities. First, protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination between member states to address such threats. Second, improving the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices, and other crisis-relevant products and contributing to their accessibility and affordability. Third, strengthening health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency, including through supporting digital transformation, integrated work between care sectors, primary care, disease prevention, and health promotion. Fourth, contributing to protecting people from serious cross-border threats to health and supporting actions in third countries and international health organizations."

The Health Union concept encompasses several dimensions including enhanced capacity for health emergency preparedness and response, stronger EU agencies with clearer mandates, more systematic cooperation on health challenges transcending borders, and greater investment in health innovation and research.\nThe practical development of the Health Union proceeds through incremental steps rather than dramatic treaty changes. Strengthened mandates for ECDC and EMA, the establishment of HERA, increased budgets for health programs, and new legislative proposals on issues such as health data and pharmaceutical regulation all contribute to building the Health Union in practice. However, tensions persist between ambitions for stronger EU health capacity and concerns about preserving national autonomy in healthcare decisions.\nFuture evolution of the Health Union may include further strengthening of emergency response mechanisms, potentially including binding EU decisions during serious cross-border health crises. Some envision development of EU health system benchmarking and performance assessment, though this raises sensitivity about implicit comparisons and potential pressure on healthcare organization. Enhanced financing mechanisms for health, potentially including EU health bonds or expanded health budgets, could provide resources for more ambitious initiatives. However, all such developments must navigate the tension between perceived need for stronger EU action and member state insistence on preserving national competences."

The proposed regulation, published in 2022 and under legislative negotiation as of 2025, aims to create a comprehensive framework for health data use supporting both healthcare delivery and research while ensuring robust data protection.\nThe EHDS distinguishes between primary use of health data for healthcare provision and secondary use for research, innovation, policymaking, and regulatory purposes. For primary use, the regulation would establish rights for individuals to access and control their electronic health records, requirements for health data interoperability enabling records to be shared across borders, and frameworks for electronic prescriptions and patient summaries that work throughout the EU. These provisions aim to support patient mobility, enable cross-border healthcare, and improve care coordination.\nSecondary use provisions establish frameworks for researchers, innovators, policymakers, and regulators to access health data in privacy-preserving ways. Health data access bodies in each member state would provide secure access to health datasets for approved uses, applying consistent criteria for access and implementing technical and organizational safeguards. A permit system would authorize data users, and a catalogue would enable discovery of available datasets across the EU.\nThe EHDS proposal addresses multiple challenges. Interoperability standards would enable different health information systems to exchange data effectively, overcoming current fragmentation where health data is locked in incompatible systems. Data quality requirements would ensure that data used for secondary purposes meets standards for completeness, accuracy, and documentation. Governance frameworks would balance access for legitimate uses against privacy protection, preventing unauthorized use or breaches.\nImplementation of the EHDS will require substantial technical, organizational, and cultural changes. Health information systems must adopt common standards and incorporate interfaces enabling data portability. Health data access bodies must be established with appropriate expertise and resources. Healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers must adapt to new frameworks for data access and use. Most fundamentally, trust must be built that health data will be used responsibly, with benefits flowing back to individuals and society while risks of misuse or privacy violations are mitigated.\nThe timeline for EHDS implementation anticipates adoption of the regulation in 2024-2025, with gradual implementation over several years as technical standards are developed, national infrastructures are built, and stakeholders adapt to new requirements. The EHDS represents an ambitious vision of health data as a resource supporting better healthcare and research while respecting individual rights and privacy."

The reform addresses multiple objectives that sometimes tension with each other including ensuring availability of medicines across the EU, supporting innovation particularly for unmet medical needs, reducing regulatory burden, addressing medicine shortages, and promoting environmental sustainability.\nKey elements of the proposed reform include revised incentive structures for medicines. Currently, medicines receive regulatory data protection and market exclusivity periods protecting against generic competition. The reform proposes making exclusivity periods conditional, with additional protection awarded for medicines addressing unmet needs, medicines made available in all member states, or medicines for which clinical trials included sufficient diversity of participants. This conditionality aims to incentivize industry behavior aligned with public health priorities.\nAccelerated pathways for medicines addressing high unmet needs would be expanded, potentially including adaptive pathways where initial authorizations based on limited data are confirmed through post-authorization evidence generation. Provisions addressing medicine shortages include requirements for early notification of discontinuations, shortage monitoring obligations, and potentially requirements to maintain supply in all markets where authorization is held.\nRegulatory burden reduction for generic and biosimilar medicines could accelerate entry of lower-cost competitors after patent expiration, improving affordability and access. Streamlined procedures for medicines authorized in comparable regulatory systems could reduce duplication while maintaining high safety standards. However, proposals must balance efficiency with ensuring robust safety and efficacy assessment.\nEnvironmental sustainability provisions would require pharmaceutical companies to assess environmental risks, implement measures minimizing pharmaceutical pollution, and report on sustainability indicators. Given growing evidence of pharmaceutical contamination of water systems and potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems and antimicrobial resistance, integrating environmental considerations into pharmaceutical regulation represents an important evolution.\nThe pharmaceutical reform proposals have generated intense debate among stakeholders. Industry raises concerns about reduced intellectual property protection affecting innovation incentives, while health systems and payers emphasize affordability and access imperatives. Patient organizations seek to ensure that reform does not compromise medicine availability or slow access to innovations. Balancing these competing concerns while maintaining high safety standards represents the central challenge for the ongoing legislative process."

The mission emphasizes translational research bridging from laboratory discoveries to clinical application, recognizing that many scientific advances do not reach patients due to barriers in translation and implementation.\nSpecific initiatives under the cancer mission include development of cancer diagnostic tools enabling earlier and more accurate detection, creation of a European Cancer Imaging Initiative providing training datasets for AI-based diagnostic tools, and research on cancer prevention addressing modifiable risk factors. The mission also funds research on rare cancers where small patient populations impede traditional research approaches, and on childhood cancers where distinct biology requires specialized research efforts.\nLooking beyond the current mission, future cancer initiatives may include expanded screening programs as new technologies enable effective screening for additional cancer types. Immunotherapy approaches continue to evolve, with research on combinations, biomarkers predicting response, and mechanisms of resistance. Cancer survivorship receives growing attention, addressing long-term effects of cancer and treatment, psychosocial support needs, and prevention of recurrence.\nIntegration of cancer care with other health priorities also emerges as important.

Implementation of this ambitious agenda requires sustained commitment, adequate resources, and coordination across multiple sectors given that mental health is influenced by factors far beyond healthcare.\nKey implementation challenges include integration of mental health into primary care and general healthcare settings, addressing fragmentation that often results in people with mental health needs falling through gaps in services. Training of primary care providers in mental health assessment and basic interventions can improve access while reducing pressure on specialized services. Integration of mental health and physical health care is particularly important given high rates of comorbidity.\nWorkforce development represents a critical need, with shortages of mental health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers in many member states. Expanding training capacity, improving working conditions to enhance retention, and developing new professional roles such as peer support workers and mental health coaches can help address workforce gaps.\nSuicide prevention requires comprehensive approaches including primary prevention addressing risk factors, training of healthcare and other professionals in suicide risk assessment, ensuring access to crisis services, implementing means restriction, and supporting those bereaved by suicide. Evidence-based interventions exist but implementation remains inconsistent across Europe.\nDigital mental health tools offer potential to improve access particularly in areas with provider shortages, but quality assurance is essential. Regulatory frameworks must ensure that apps and online services meet evidence standards, protect user data, and integrate appropriately with traditional services. Questions about reimbursement for digital mental health interventions and their place in treatment pathways require attention.\nAddressing mental health stigma and discrimination remains foundational, as stigma deters help-seeking and contributes to social exclusion of people with mental health conditions. Public campaigns, contact-based interventions bringing people into direct contact with those who have experienced mental health challenges, and anti-discrimination legislation all contribute to stigma reduction."

An EU cardiovascular disease plan is in development, expected to establish priorities and actions analogous to those in the Beating Cancer Plan.\nAnticipated priorities include prevention of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Population-level interventions addressing social determinants of cardiovascular health, including urban environments, food systems, and economic factors, complement individual-level risk factor management.\nEarly detection and screening for cardiovascular disease receives attention, with consideration of systematic screening for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol in defined populations. Atrial fibrillation screening could prevent strokes through early anticoagulation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in older men demonstrates cost-effectiveness. However, questions persist about optimal screening strategies, age ranges, and integration with existing healthcare services.\nImproving acute cardiovascular care includes ensuring timely access to reperfusion for heart attacks and strokes, as outcomes are highly time-dependent. Networks ensuring rapid transport to centers capable of providing advanced interventions can save lives and reduce disability. Cardiac rehabilitation following heart attacks improves outcomes but remains underutilized, suggesting need for expanded capacity and access.\nChronic disease management for people with established cardiovascular disease aims to prevent complications, optimize quality of life, and reduce healthcare utilization. Integrated care models coordinating across primary and specialist care, including nurses and other professionals in care teams, and using digital tools for monitoring can improve outcomes while controlling costs.\nAddressing cardiovascular inequalities between countries, regions, and population groups requires research on determinants and interventions to reduce gaps.

A proposed Council Recommendation on strengthening EU action against AMR through a One Health approach, published in 2023, aims to enhance coordination and ambition across member states.\nThe recommendation proposes national targets for reduction of antimicrobial consumption in human and veterinary medicine, recognizing that reduced consumption slows resistance development. Targets would be differentiated based on current consumption levels, with high-consuming countries expected to achieve larger reductions. Implementation of targets requires monitoring systems tracking consumption, stewardship programs promoting appropriate use, and policy measures such as restrictions on antibiotic prescribing and use.\nInfection prevention and control receives emphasis as a means to reduce need for antimicrobials by preventing infections. Healthcare-associated infections represent a significant source of antibiotic-resistant infections. Strengthening IPC programs, ensuring adequate staffing and resources, implementing evidence-based practices, and monitoring IPC performance can reduce infection rates and consequently antimicrobial use.\nThe pull incentive question for new antimicrobials remains contested. Without new mechanisms, market failure will persist as the commercial returns on antimicrobials do not justify development costs, particularly given that new antibiotics should be reserved for resistant infections. Proposed approaches include subscription models where health systems pay fixed fees for access to antibiotics regardless of volumes used, transferable exclusivity vouchers providing market exclusivity for other products as reward for antibiotic development, and direct grants supporting clinical development.\nEnvironmental dimensions of AMR receive growing attention, as antimicrobial contamination of water systems from pharmaceutical manufacturing and agriculture contributes to resistance development. Standards for wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturing, regulations on veterinary antimicrobial use, and treatment of agricultural runoff can reduce environmental antimicrobial concentrations.\nInternational cooperation remains essential given that AMR spreads globally. The EU supports capacity building in partner countries for surveillance, laboratory capacity, stewardship programs, and infection control. Global governance mechanisms through WHO, FAO, and OIE provide frameworks for coordinated action. Access to antibiotics in low-income countries must be balanced against stewardship imperatives, requiring nuanced approaches that ensure access to essential antibiotics while promoting appropriate use."

Better forecasting enables proactive training adjustments, reducing cycles of shortage and oversupply. Cooperation on workforce planning can help anticipate cross-border movements of healthcare professionals.\nTraining and education initiatives address both quantity and quality of healthcare workforce preparation. Expanding training capacity where shortages persist, ensuring curricula prepare professionals for evolving practice including digital health competencies, and developing continuing education systems maintaining competence throughout careers all require attention. Interprofessional education preparing professionals to work effectively in teams can improve care coordination.\nRetention of healthcare professionals requires addressing working conditions contributing to burnout and attrition. High workloads, inadequate staffing, difficult working conditions, lack of professional development opportunities, and insufficient recognition all contribute to healthcare professionals leaving the profession or migrating to other countries. Improving working conditions, ensuring adequate compensation, providing professional development, and creating supportive work environments can enhance retention.\nEthical recruitment practices are essential given that many EU member states recruit healthcare professionals from third countries. WHO Global Code of Practice on International Recruitment of Health Personnel establishes principles for ethical recruitment, including discouraging active recruitment from countries with critical shortages, ensuring transparent employment contracts, and supporting source countries in building their health workforce capacity.\nDeployment of healthcare professionals during emergencies, highlighted by COVID-19, requires mechanisms for rapid mobilization, clear legal frameworks for cross-border deployment, and systems supporting deployed professionals.

Effective plans include early warning systems triggering protective actions when dangerous heat is forecast, guidance for vulnerable populations, cool spaces where people can escape heat, and monitoring of heat-related morbidity and mortality. Urban planning incorporating green space and water features can reduce urban heat island effects.\nVector-borne diseases including those transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks may expand their geographic range as climate change shifts species distributions. Enhanced surveillance for vectors and diseases, control programs targeting vector populations, and clinical capacity to recognize and treat vector-borne diseases can mitigate risks. Invasive mosquito species already established in southern Europe could spread northward with climate warming.\nAir pollution, closely linked to climate change through shared sources in fossil fuel combustion, causes significant mortality and morbidity. Policies reducing greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously improve air quality and health. EU air quality standards set limits on pollutants, though evidence suggests that health effects occur at levels below current standards, suggesting need for stricter standards over time.\nClimate resilience of health systems requires attention to both physical infrastructure and operational preparedness. Healthcare facilities must be able to maintain operations during extreme weather events, which may require backup power, water storage, structural resilience to flooding or storms, and cool facilities during heat waves. Supply chains for medicines and medical supplies require redundancy given vulnerability to climate impacts on production and transport.\nThe health co-benefits of climate action represent an important framing, as policies to mitigate climate change often yield immediate health benefits. Active transport infrastructure promoting walking and cycling reduces both emissions and chronic diseases. Plant-rich diets have lower environmental impact while reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Energy-efficient housing reduces both emissions and respiratory disease from indoor air pollution. Emphasizing health co-benefits can strengthen political support for climate action."

    "text": "Digital Health Transformation\nDigital technologies offer potential to transform healthcare delivery, but realizing this potential while avoiding harms requires thoughtful governance. Beyond the European Health Data Space, multiple digital health initiatives advance.\nArtificial intelligence applications in healthcare span diagnosis support, treatment planning, drug discovery, and health system management. AI diagnostic tools for radiology, pathology, and other specialties show promise for improving accuracy and efficiency. Treatment recommendation systems can support clinical decision-making by synthesizing evidence and patient-specific factors. However, AI also raises concerns about algorithmic bias, lack of transparency in decision-making, unclear liability when AI contributes to adverse outcomes, and potential deskilling of healthcare professionals.\nRegulation of AI in healthcare is addressed through the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which classifies most healthcare AI as high-risk requiring conformity assessment before market introduction. Requirements include data quality standards, transparency and explainability, human oversight, and robustness. Healthcare-specific AI guidance may provide additional detail on appropriate development, validation, and deployment of AI in clinical settings.\nTelemedicine expanded dramatically during COVID-19 and much of this expansion is likely to persist. Telemedicine offers convenience for patients, improves access in underserved areas, and can reduce healthcare costs. However, telemedicine also raises questions about quality of care when physical examination is not possible, data protection for consultations conducted remotely, and reimbursement policies. Ensuring telemedicine complements rather than replaces in-person care where the latter is clinically indicated remains important.\nRemote patient monitoring using wearables and sensors enables continuous monitoring of chronic conditions, potentially enabling earlier intervention and reducing hospitalizations. Digital therapeutics providing evidence-based interventions through apps or software are emerging for conditions including mental health disorders, diabetes, and substance use. However, evidence standards for digital health interventions, reimbursement frameworks, and integration with traditional care all require development.\nCybersecurity for health systems is increasingly critical as digitalization creates new vulnerabilities. Ransomware attacks on healthcare facilities disrupt care delivery and compromise patient data. Medical devices connected to networks may be vulnerable to hacking with potentially life-threatening consequences. Building cybersecurity capacity, implementing security standards, and planning for cyber incidents all require attention and resources.\nDigital inclusion must be considered to ensure that digital transformation does not widen health inequalities. Older adults, people with disabilities, those with limited digital literacy, and populations with poor internet access risk being left behind by digital health. Maintaining non-digital alternatives, designing inclusive digital interfaces, and providing support for digital health use can promote equity."

    "text": "Planning in Healthcare\nStrategic management represents a comprehensive philosophy and approach to organizational governance within healthcare systems. The term “strategy” finds its origins in Greek military terminology, where it denoted the “general of the army” and encompassed the planning of victory through effective resource deployment. Contemporary experts, including Duncan and colleagues, have identified several critical areas of knowledge that significantly enhance the quality of strategic management in healthcare contexts.\nThe first essential area involves generalized evidence, which serves to control and limit contextual variability while testing hypotheses through systematic investigation. Complementing this is the study of specific contexts, characterized by the unique social, physical, and cultural characteristics of individual healthcare institutions, with particular attention to ongoing processes, established habits, and organizational traditions. The third critical area focuses on measuring healthcare system functioning through the evaluation of change effects using rigorous research methods for analysis, assessment, and perspective ranking. Finally, the change plan articulates methods for linking evidence to specific contexts, while the implementation of planned changes ensures the availability of necessary strategic, operational, and human resources.\nStrategic thinking forms the fundamental intellectual foundation underlying all strategic management activities. This cognitive process manifests through orientation within the system’s external environment, comprehensive data analysis, assumption discussion, and the generation of innovative ideas. Strategic planning builds upon this foundation by constructing algorithmic sequences of steps designed to execute the healthcare system’s mission, ultimately producing a developed plan and comprehensive strategy. This process encompasses situational analysis, both external and internal examination, the development of various strategic frameworks including adaptive, market, and competitive approaches, strategy formulation, and the planning of implementation through detailed action plans.\nThe implementation phase involves consecutive actions through which strategy management achieves the organization’s strategic goals, incorporating managerial actions, evaluation processes, and new initiatives. Overall, strategic management serves multiple vital functions within healthcare organizations. It connects system members through shared values while fostering a sense of community and organizational identity. In many cases, it improves financial outcomes while providing clear concepts, specific goals, strong leadership, and decision-making consistency. The approach enhances overall coordination across organizational units and stimulates innovation to meet the demands of dynamically changing healthcare environments.\nAs experts Swain and Duncan indicate, strategic management fundamentally seeks to identify questions that will prove important for future organizational success. These crucial questions include whether the organization will continue providing current health activities in the future, what new health activities will be needed to meet emerging demands, and which currently provided health activities will become obsolete or unnecessary as healthcare needs evolve.\n\n\nHealth Economics\nEconomics represents a social science dedicated to studying the choices people make when utilizing available resources to satisfy their diverse needs. More broadly, it encompasses the science of production, distribution, and consumption of both material and immaterial goods within society. Health economics applies these economic principles and methodologies to problems and phenomena specifically related to health and healthcare delivery. The public health system, viewed as an organized entity, pursues the ideal goal of most effectively utilizing its resources while achieving high health efficiency in providing medical services to the population.\nThe field divides into two primary branches, each addressing different scales of economic analysis. Microeconomic health science serves both public health and private healthcare sectors, with the latter representing an activity pursuing real economic goals including sustainability and profitability. All economic considerations applicable to profit-seeking enterprises naturally apply to the private healthcare sector. Meanwhile, macroeconomic health science examines healthcare’s economic problems at the national level, addressing fundamental questions about what type of healthcare system a nation requires, how to provide adequate resources, how to subsidize and finance healthcare institution activities, and how to structure the healthcare system by specialty, territory, and quantity to achieve optimal results. These constitute short-term challenges, while strategic considerations explore the connections between material and spiritual wealth and healthcare outcomes, examining how economic development affects both the healthcare system and national health. This branch interprets various forms and methods of financing medical activities while evaluating their effects, creates specific economic methods for healthcare work, seeks arguments for improving medical services and national healthcare policy, and evaluates potential innovations in healthcare delivery.\nThe primary goal of health economics centers on generating maximum health benefits for the widest possible range of users while operating within budgetary constraints. Central to economic thinking is the concept of opportunity cost, which recognizes that every opportunity we choose to pursue necessarily means foregoing another alternative opportunity. Every choice carries a cost, and the true cost extends beyond mere monetary payment. The genuine cost of utilizing one opportunity lies in foregoing other alternative opportunities, specifically representing the expense of the best but unused alternative when selecting a particular type of activity.\nHealth economics exhibits several distinctive features that differentiate it from other economic sectors. The high degree of differentiation of health products presents the first major characteristic. Healthcare functions as a public service characterized by substantial heterogeneity and the impossibility of repeatedly offering identical services. Like any service, healthcare can only be purchased directly from the provider and cannot be traded among potential service recipients. Individual patients may harbor different preferences regarding treatment type, duration, location, specific health risks, and even the personality of their treating physician. This heterogeneity of health products combines with the heterogeneity of consumer preferences, creating a complex market dynamic. Consumers naturally gravitate toward healthcare providers who best satisfy their preferences, thereby reinforcing these preferred providers’ market positions. However, this market behavior simultaneously reduces market positions for other providers, ultimately affecting consumers of their offered health products.\nThe low level of substitution between different healthcare providers generates high levels of market presence and influence resembling monopolistic conditions, which consequently manifests in low demand elasticity for health products. Therefore, the healthcare market can be characterized as monopolistically competitive. From the hospital medical care market perspective, relatively few providers operate consistently over extended periods while maintaining high quality levels of health products. This situation creates an oligopolistic supply of well-differentiated health products, allowing healthcare providers to exert significant influence on price setting within this market. In this regard, the healthcare products market does not differ substantially from other markets featuring significant product differentiation. Economic theory provides limited general guidance for appropriate antitrust policies in markets with considerable product differentiation, though it bears noting that strong state regulation and price fixing of health products contribute to decreased social welfare.\nAsymmetric information and moral hazard constitute the second major distinctive feature of health economics. Moral hazard, as an economic category, represents situations wherein one party engages in high-risk actions while knowing it enjoys protection from risk, even as another party bears at least the financial costs. The structure of information proves crucial for understanding and analyzing healthcare product markets. Asymmetric information leads to moral hazard in healthcare, increasing demand and consequently expenses without achieving adequate improvements in health products or actual consumer health improvements. Information asymmetry, also termed information insufficiency, arises when the healthcare product provider, typically a physician, possesses substantially greater knowledge than the buyer or patient.\nAsymmetric information in healthcare manifests both in physician-patient relationships and in relationships between patients and insurance or institutional payers. In every case of illness and treatment, the physician possesses superior information about the patient’s condition compared to the patient themselves. This disparity raises fundamental questions about the extent to which physicians will represent patient interests and act as their agents. The problem encompasses how to verify and confirm accurate illness diagnosis and appropriate treatment selection. Additional problems arise when consumer uncertainty about health outcomes prompts searches for additional health products that are not always justified, ultimately inducing unnecessary additional demand within the healthcare system.\nThe presence of asymmetric information also manifests between insured individuals and financing institutions, as consumers possess more intimate knowledge of their own health conditions compared to payers. Consumers often pay a smaller portion or no portion of the price for received health products, while the main portion or entire price falls to the payer. In the presence of insurance coverage, consumers may lack sufficient motivation to act responsibly regarding their health maintenance and prevention activities.\nEnhanced state regulation represents the third distinctive feature, arising from the peculiarities of the healthcare sector and the specific characteristics discussed previously. These unique features necessitate mandatory intervention by the state through regulatory mechanisms in every healthcare subsector.\nThe assessment of economic decisions in healthcare primarily occurs through Health Technology Assessment, commonly abbreviated as HTA. This approach represents a form of policy in scientific research that investigates both short-term and long-term results associated with health technology applications. Its fundamental aim involves providing comprehensive information about alternative health strategies. HTA functions as a multidisciplinary activity that systematically evaluates the technical characteristics, safety, clinical effectiveness and efficiency, costs, value, and the organizational, social, legal, and ethical consequences of applying health technologies in healthcare settings. The focus centers on both clinical and economic value, with analysis being comparative to existing or best-available alternatives.\nMeasuring the ratio between costs and therapeutic outcomes finds application in economic evaluations of health technologies through Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, abbreviated as CEA. Economic analyses of the Cost-Utility Analysis type, known as CUA, pay particular attention to the quality of health outcomes. CUA utilizes Quality-Adjusted Life Years, or QALYs, as a health measure that incorporates a combination of life expectancy and health-related quality of life. The primary outcome in CUA analysis becomes the cost per gained QALY, providing a standardized metric for comparing different interventions. Cost-Benefit Analysis, or CBA, requires expressing health technology outcomes in monetary terms, thereby enabling direct comparison of gradually increasing costs and outcomes.\n\n\nMarketing in Healthcare\nManaging marketing in healthcare represents both an art and a science dedicated to selecting target markets, attracting, retaining, and increasing patient numbers through the creation, offering, and selling of higher health value. The term marketing inherently connects society’s two main functions of production and consumption. By its fundamental nature, marketing operates as a managerial process responsible for identifying, predicting, and satisfying customer or consumer needs and requirements within market conditions. Marketing can be understood as a comprehensive set of activities designed to align producer resources with market requirements. Within this framework, marketing must solve two interconnected problems: the first addresses consumer needs and their satisfaction, while the second concerns producer profit generation. The combined solution to these problems operates through the mechanism of competition, which involves providing higher quality, desired, and differentiated goods and services compared to competitors.\nSeveral key concepts form the foundation of healthcare marketing. Target markets and segments represent the first crucial concept, recognizing that no healthcare products can meet the health demands of all patients universally. Therefore, the primary criterion for healthcare market segmentation relies on demographic characteristics and patient diseases. Healthcare marketing requires fundamental research on morbidity patterns and causes of mortality and disability. For each selected target market segment, comprising patients with similar or identical disease conditions, the provider must develop a valuable health product positioned in patients’ minds as carrying essential health benefits.\nHealth needs and demand for health products constitute the initial stage of any marketing cycle, requiring establishment of health needs and demand within the target market. Unlike other economic sectors where the real market includes only solvent demand, healthcare presents a unique situation. Due to the presence of a payer other than the patient, the total demand for health products is considered solvent regardless of individual patient financial capacity. Health value and patient satisfaction represent critical factors in successful health product delivery. Successful health products inherently bring value and satisfaction to patients. Using the structure of health value, defined as the ratio of health benefits to costs, every manager can increase value through several possible approaches: increasing health benefits while maintaining costs, maintaining benefits while reducing costs, increasing benefits more than increasing costs, or reducing benefits less than reducing costs. The latter approach finds limited acceptance among patients and consequently sees minimal application in healthcare marketing.\nThe transaction concept represents the exchange of values and forms a fundamental part of the marketing process. Within this framework, consumers receive health while paying health contributions, payers receive health contributions while paying for health products, and providers receive money while offering health products. Marketing relationships aim to establish long-term mutually beneficial relationships between healthcare facilities and their patients, staff, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Relationship marketing builds strong economic, technical, and social connections between parties, which evolve into what are termed “marketing networks.” The public benefits of such marketing networks in healthcare can be substantial, aimed again at improving prevention, quality, and accessibility. However, healthcare managers and society must carefully control the balance between the desire for higher incomes and the quality of health products.\nMarketing channels enable healthcare facilities to reach their specialized target markets through two primary channel types. The communication channel facilitates the conveyance of messages and reception of information from patients and referring physicians. The sales channel facilitates the purchase of health products, enabling transaction completion. The supply system represents a chain of suppliers through which each healthcare facility obtains services and goods necessary for health product production. Through the supply system, healthcare facilities must gain value while maintaining cost efficiency.\nCompetition represents a critically important issue in healthcare marketing management, encompassing all existing and potentially competing health products. Competition can be analyzed at several levels: individual, industry, sectoral, and generic competition. The marketing environment in which a healthcare facility operates divides into two interconnected parts. The target environment includes patients, staff, suppliers, and other direct stakeholders. The surrounding environment encompasses demographic, economic, natural, technological, political, and sociocultural factors. The surrounding environment can strongly influence processes and participants in the target environment, creating both opportunities and challenges for healthcare marketing efforts.\nThe marketing mix, also referred to as marketing structure, represents a comprehensive set of activities that health product providers use to achieve their market goals. The fundamental marketing tools include product development, price setting, place or distribution management, and promotion activities. Managing the marketing cycle primarily consists of three types of activities that work in concert. Strategic activities encompass market research, segmentation, and positioning decisions. Tactical activities involve product manufacturing, pricing strategies, promotion campaigns, and placement organization. Administrative activities include control mechanisms, evaluation of results, and improvement of marketing tactics and strategy based on performance data.\nSeveral factors critically influence the effectiveness of healthcare marketing strategies. Continuous interpersonal relationships with customers or patients based on trust and morality form the foundation of successful healthcare marketing. Professional competence and established prestige of physicians significantly influence patient choices and satisfaction. Easy and accessible access to healthcare services with minimal bureaucratic procedures before contacting physicians proves particularly important since healthcare service users almost invariably experience stress when seeking care. Careful selection of healthcare personnel requires special qualities including tolerance, empathy, communicativeness, discretion, and self-discipline. Training healthcare personnel in standardized workplace behavioral patterns ensures consistency in service delivery and patient experience. Continuous monitoring and control of patient satisfaction with medical service quality provides essential feedback for improvement. Finally, carefully considered and long-term-oriented policies for material stimulation of personnel help maintain high-quality service delivery and staff motivation.\nMarketing for healthcare services requires the existence of a functioning market in healthcare, though with important qualifications. The healthcare market should not be viewed as an end in itself but rather as a means to achieve better health outcomes. The market does not pursue profit as its primary objective but seeks more effective use of resources and fairer remuneration for medical work. Market mechanisms appropriately find their place in both private and public sectors of healthcare, though their implementation requires careful consideration of healthcare’s unique characteristics.\nHealthcare marketing faces numerous distinctive challenges that require specialized approaches. The presence of negative demand for offered services or products represents the first significant challenge. A market exists in a state of negative demand when the majority of customers disapprove of or dislike the products or services of a given organization, with some patients even spending additional funds to avoid using them. For example, certain individuals harbor negative attitudes toward vaccinations, dental maintenance, or psychiatric assistance, sometimes paying expensive transportation costs and consultation fees with specialists from larger centers specifically to avoid local specialist services. The marketing task in such cases involves analyzing why current and potential clients dislike offered products or services, and whether future marketing programs can change client beliefs and attitudes through quality improvements, price reductions, access modifications, positive advertising, and other appropriate marketing conditions.\nThe absence of demand for products and services presents another challenge, where target consumers or markets remain disinterested or indifferent to offered products and services. The marketing task here involves finding ways to connect the benefits customers will receive from offered products and services with natural human needs and interests, thereby creating awareness and demand. Latent needs or demand represent situations where significant portions of medical service consumers would eagerly share offered medical assistance and treatment, but for certain diseases lacking satisfactory treatment, they do not seek services to the necessary extent or avoid certain healthcare facilities entirely. Enormous latent needs exist for treatment and servicing of cancer patients, aging and elderly population problems, various cardiovascular diseases, treatment and care for patients with disabling conditions, and other difficult or incurable diseases and conditions. The near future will likely bring methods and means to satisfy these latent needs and other healthcare-related needs.\nDecreasing demand or needs affect every organization eventually, as demand decreases for one or more services or products. One reason for demand decrease involves the reduction in needs for some diseases due to effective treatment and prevention availability. Another reason stems from increasing preferences and opportunities for treating patients at home or in daily care units, which reduces hospital base utilization. Marketers need to analyze reasons for demand decrease and clarify whether demand can be stimulated again by finding new target markets, changing product or service qualities, expanding or modifying service ranges, improving distribution and changing production volumes, or developing new, broader, and more effective communication to popularize products or services. The marketing task involves changing the decreasing market and remarketing offered products or services to restore the market. If restoration proves impossible, stopping product production or closing facilities becomes necessary to prevent resource waste.\nUnregulated demand presents challenges when many healthcare organizations encounter demand variations for certain products or services across different seasons, days of the week, or hours of the day, causing either underutilization or overloading of capabilities and capacities. For example, emergency medical centers experience higher demand for medical assistance in evenings and on Saturdays and Sundays when doctor’s offices are closed or healthcare facilities near major cities close. Pediatricians face significantly greater burdens at the beginning and end of school years. Hospital paraclinical services primarily experience heavy utilization during weekdays while remaining underutilized on weekends and afternoons. The marketing task in these cases involves finding ways to change the timing to meet needs and demand through flexible advertising, access modifications, pricing strategies, or other initiatives.\nDemand according to capabilities, representing full utilization, occurs when organizations find themselves meeting needs and demand that correspond precisely to their capacity capabilities. The marketing task in these cases involves maintaining demand according to current levels while preparing to meet possible everyday or future market changes, evolving preferences, or emerging stronger competition. Organizations must maintain quality and continuously measure customer satisfaction to ensure high-quality production continues.\nExcessive demand, exceeding service capabilities, affects some healthcare organizations facing demand levels that surpass their service capacities. This situation often occurs with home healthcare services where calls exceed service capabilities. The marketing task in these cases, called demarketing, involves finding ways to reduce demand or needs by discouraging demand temporarily or permanently if deemed necessary. Generally, demarketing consists of several activities including increasing prices, reducing advertising, and reducing or restricting access to services or products. Selective demarketing seeks ways to reduce total needs while attempting to reduce demand coming from market segments that are less profitable or less in need of the organization’s services or products. Demarketing in this context aims not to destroy needs and demand entirely but only to reduce their level to manageable proportions.\nUnhealthy demand, representing demand for unhealthy products or services, requires special attention. Products considered unhealthy or detrimental to health that are used by some population segments require attracting forces to discourage or limit their consumption. Demarketing in this context, or the demarketing campaigns themselves, represent campaigns against sales. Such campaigns are organized against cigarette sales, alcohol consumption, drugs and narcotics use, against large families in some countries through family planning, against abortions, and other harmful practices. Demarketing or antimarketing against harmful products uses almost identical means and activities in the same direction, seeking to reduce consumption through corresponding anti-advertising and adequate emotional communication that emphasizes health risks and promotes healthier alternatives."
