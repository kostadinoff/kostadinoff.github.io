    "text": "Non-Communicable Disease and Healthcare System Developments\n\nBreakthrough Gene Therapy for Fatal Neurodegenerative Disease\nPhase 1-2 trial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrate preliminary efficacy of AAV9-delivered gene therapy for type II GM1 gangliosidosis, a fatal lysosomal storage disorder caused by β-galactosidase deficiency. GM1 gangliosidosis results from biallelic pathogenic variants in the GLB1 gene and leads to progressive neurodegeneration with accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in lysosomes. The disease manifests in three clinical forms based on age of onset, with type II presenting in late infancy or early childhood and characterized by progressive motor and cognitive decline, typically proving fatal within the first decade of life.\nThe trial enrolled nine children with type II GM1 gangliosidosis who received a single intravenous infusion of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 encoding human β-galactosidase along with immunosuppression. Over a three-year observation period, all participants demonstrated increased cerebrospinal fluid β-galactosidase activity and decreased GM1 ganglioside concentrations, suggesting biological target engagement. Neuroimaging revealed patterns consistent with reduced cerebral atrophy rates and favorable myelination changes compared to baseline. Clinical assessments showed stabilization of expressive communication and gross motor function, though fine motor and receptive communication scores declined. The median Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score was 3 (minimal improvement) at two years and 4 (no change) at three years, comparing favorably to historical controls who show progressive deterioration.\nSafety concerns emerged during the trial, with 124 adverse events recorded over three years, 30 of which were deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to gene therapy. All nine participants experienced elevated serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels that returned to baseline by 18 months. One participant required hospitalization for severe vomiting attributed to the therapy. The findings suggest that AAV9-mediated gene delivery can achieve biochemical correction and may slow disease progression in some domains, though significant adverse events and incomplete clinical benefit indicate the need for further optimization. This represents the first demonstration of potential therapeutic benefit in this universally fatal condition and establishes proof-of-concept for gene therapy approaches to lysosomal storage disorders affecting the central nervous system.\n\n\nNovel Dengue Vector Control Technology Demonstrates High Efficacy\nA cluster-randomized trial conducted in Singapore has validated a novel approach to dengue control using repeated release of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia pipientis bacteria. The intervention exploits cytoplasmic incompatibility whereby wild-type female mosquitoes that mate with Wolbachia-infected males produce nonviable offspring, potentially suppressing mosquito populations and reducing dengue virus transmission. Dengue represents a major public health threat across tropical and subtropical regions, with Aedes aegypti serving as the primary vector. Singapore, despite intensive traditional vector control efforts, experiences recurrent dengue outbreaks with substantial morbidity.\nThe trial divided 15 geographic population clusters into intervention clusters (393,236 residents) receiving deployments of Wolbachia-infected males and control clusters (331,192 residents) receiving no deployments. Adult wild-type Aedes aegypti populations were suppressed across intervention clusters, with average mosquito abundance decreasing from 0.18 at baseline to 0.041 from three months post-intervention through the 24-month trial period, compared to 0.277 in control clusters. In the intention-to-treat analysis examining outcomes at six months or more post-intervention, 6% of residents in intervention clusters tested positive for dengue (354 of 5,722 tests) compared to 21% in control clusters (1,519 of 7,080 tests). The protective efficacy of the intervention, calculated as (1 − odds ratio) × 100, ranged from 71% to 72% with three to twelve months or more of Wolbachia mosquito exposure, represented by odds ratios of 0.28 to 0.29.\nThis trial provides rigorous evidence that sterile insect technique using Wolbachia-infected males can achieve substantial suppression of Aedes aegypti populations and dramatic reductions in dengue infection risk in a real-world urban setting. The approach represents a fundamentally different paradigm from traditional vector control methods such as insecticide application or source reduction, offering potential advantages including species specificity, absence of chemical residues, and reduced likelihood of insecticide resistance development. The sustained effectiveness observed over 24 months suggests the method can provide durable protection when releases are maintained. These findings have significant implications for dengue control strategies globally, particularly in urban tropical settings where traditional methods have proven insufficient to prevent epidemic transmission."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Global Perspective\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nNipah Virus Disease Outbreak Among Healthcare Workers in India\nIndia reported two laboratory-confirmed cases of Nipah virus disease among healthcare workers in North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal State, representing the country’s first Nipah cases since 2025 when four cases (two fatal) were reported from Kerala. The confirmed cases are nurses aged 20-30 years, one male and one female, working at the same private hospital in Barasat. Both developed symptoms typical of severe Nipah infection in late December 2025 and were admitted to hospital in early January 2026. Diagnosis was confirmed at the National Institute for Virology in Pune on 13 January 2026 using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing. As of 21 January 2026, one patient showed clinical improvement while the other remained under critical care. Media reports suggest five total cases in the outbreak, though only two have been officially confirmed.\nNipah virus (Henipavirus nipahense) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and was first identified during a 1999 outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore. The virus maintains a natural reservoir in Pteropus fruit bats and can transmit to humans through direct contact with infected animals, consumption of food contaminated by bat excreta (particularly raw date palm sap), or person-to-person transmission through close contact with infected individuals or contaminated materials. The incubation period typically ranges from four to 14 days, with clinical manifestations varying from mild symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, and nausea to severe presentations with acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis. Case fatality rates in previous outbreaks have ranged from 40% to 75%, with survivors sometimes experiencing persistent neurological sequelae. West Bengal previously experienced Nipah outbreaks in 2001 (Siliguri) and 2007 (Nadia district).\nPublic health authorities in India implemented comprehensive response measures including enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing capacity expansion, field investigations, and contact tracing. A total of 196 contacts were identified and tested negative for Nipah virus as of 27 January 2026, with no additional cases reported to date according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Investigation into the source of exposure is ongoing, with media reporting that both nurses had attended to a patient with Nipah-like symptoms at their hospital, though this has not been confirmed through official sources. One nurse reportedly traveled to a village in Nadia district near the Bangladesh border and may have consumed raw date palm sap, a known transmission route when contaminated by bat saliva. Neighboring countries including Thailand, Nepal, and Cambodia initiated precautionary measures including information campaigns and screening for passengers arriving from India at airports, reflecting regional concern about potential cross-border transmission.\nThe likelihood of exposure to and infection with Nipah virus for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or residing in India remains very low given the limited number of infections and geographic containment of cases to date. However, the occurrence of healthcare-associated transmission demonstrates the continued risk Nipah poses as a high-consequence pathogen with pandemic potential. The virus’s high case fatality rate, capacity for person-to-person transmission in healthcare settings, absence of specific antiviral therapies or licensed vaccines, and wide geographic distribution of natural bat reservoirs across South and Southeast Asia necessitate sustained vigilance. Healthcare systems must maintain preparedness for potential imported cases, with emphasis on early recognition, appropriate infection prevention and control measures including respiratory precautions, and prompt notification to public health authorities.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nCritical Multi-Country Food-Borne Incident: Cereulide Toxin in Infant Formula\nA multi-country food safety crisis emerged following detection of cereulide, the emetic toxin produced by Bacillus cereus, in infant nutrition products manufactured by multiple companies and distributed globally. The contamination was traced to arachidonic acid oil, an omega-6 fatty acid supplement routinely added to infant formula, which became contaminated during production. Cereulide is a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide toxin notable for extreme heat stability, acid resistance, and protease resistance, enabling it to survive standard food processing conditions including pasteurization and sterilization. Following ingestion, the toxin acts on mitochondria causing cellular dysfunction and manifests clinically with rapid-onset nausea and vomiting, typically within one to five hours post-consumption.\nThe precautionary recall was initiated in December 2025 and expanded in January 2026 as the scope of contamination became apparent, affecting numerous batches, products, and brands distributed across EU/EEA Member States and countries worldwide. Multiple European food safety authorities issued recalls reported under RASFF notifications 2025.9962, 2026.0027, 2026.0173, 2026.0179, 2026.0196, 2026.0509, 2026.0347, 2026.0407, 2026.0663, 2026.0542, 2026.0598, 2026.0177, and 2026.0647. Belgium reported five infants with cereulide-positive faecal samples, representing the only laboratory-confirmed cases to date as cereulide toxin analysis in biological specimens is not routinely available in clinical microbiology laboratories. All five Belgian cases had consumed recalled infant formula and experienced favorable clinical outcomes. Of the infant formula products consumed by these cases, three of five samples tested positive for cereulide; the remaining two samples may not undergo testing.\nFrance reported 11 hospitalized infants investigated by Regional Health Agencies, all of whom recovered and returned home. Of these 11 cases, five consumed recalled infant formula while six could not be confirmed as having consumed implicated products. Notably, winter-related gastroenteritis is currently active in France, and five of the 11 hospitalized children received differential diagnoses explaining their gastrointestinal symptoms. Two unexplained infant deaths were notified in France and are under medicolegal investigation per routine protocols; approximately 300 unexplained infant deaths occur annually in France. Both deceased infants had consumed recalled infant formula, though no causal link has been established between formula consumption and these deaths. Spain reported eight cases with vomiting, five requiring hospitalization, all with history of consumption of potentially affected products, though none were laboratory-confirmed. Denmark’s food safety authority received reports of infants developing diarrhea following consumption of recalled products, but no confirmed or probable cases have been identified as samples were not investigated for toxin presence. The United Kingdom reported 36 cases with gastrointestinal symptoms following consumption of implicated batches distributed across England (24 cases), Scotland (7), Wales (3), Northern Ireland (1), and Crown Dependencies (1), with testing of recalled formula confirming cereulide presence.\nThe recalled products’ wide distribution creates moderate to high likelihood of exposure for infants consuming formula in affected regions. Impact of exposure and symptom development is low to moderate depending on infant age, with neonates and young infants less than six months potentially more vulnerable to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. The overall risk to children under one year in the EU/EEA is assessed as moderate for this incident. However, as contaminated products have been identified and recalled, current exposure likelihood is decreasing, correspondingly reducing overall risk. The European Food Safety Authority, upon request from the European Commission, established an acute reference dose for cereulide in infants and estimated cereulide concentrations in infant formula of potential safety concern on 2 February 2026, providing guidance to risk managers for determining when products should be withdrawn as precautionary public health measures.\nECDC and EFSA are jointly developing a Rapid Outbreak Assessment to support Member States in managing this incident, with publication planned for 19 February 2026. Member States are encouraged to share case information and investigation details through the EpiPulse event system and to collaborate closely with national food safety authorities when suspected cases are identified to investigate potential links to recalled formula batches. Consumers are advised to follow instructions from national food safety authorities, and parents, guardians, and caregivers possessing affected products should not feed them to infants and young children. This incident highlights vulnerabilities in global infant nutrition supply chains and the challenges of detecting and responding to contamination with unusual toxins not routinely screened in food safety testing programs.\n\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\n\nChikungunya Case Without Travel History in Bulgaria\nBulgaria reported one confirmed case of chikungunya during Week 6, representing an increase of one case compared to the previous week and bringing the year-to-date total to three cases compared to zero during the same period in 2025. The case was laboratory confirmed though clinical and epidemiological details were not provided in surveillance reports. Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, causing acute febrile illness characterized by high fever and severe, often debilitating polyarthralgia. Joint pain may persist for weeks to months, occasionally progressing to chronic arthritis. The virus is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, with Aedes albopictus established in multiple European countries including Bulgaria, creating theoretical potential for autochthonous transmission during warmer months.\nThe occurrence of a chikungunya case in February, outside the typical mosquito activity season in Bulgaria, strongly suggests travel-associated acquisition rather than local transmission. The absence of epidemiological details in the surveillance report precludes definitive determination of exposure source. However, the detection underscores the importance of considering arboviral infections in travelers returning from endemic regions presenting with acute febrile illness and arthralgia, even during winter months. Healthcare providers should maintain awareness of travel-associated arboviral diseases and ensure appropriate diagnostic testing. The presence of competent vectors in Bulgaria and other European countries necessitates continued surveillance for potential autochthonous transmission during mosquito activity seasons, though the risk remains low under current climatic and vectorial conditions."

    "section": "Infectious Diseases: European Union/European Economic Area",
    "text": "Infectious Diseases: European Union/European Economic Area\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nRespiratory Virus Epidemiology: Influenza Season Progression and RSV Surge\nRespiratory virus circulation across the EU/EEA remains elevated during Week 6, with the number of people experiencing respiratory illness symptoms continuing to increase since the start of 2026, indicating widespread transmission. The 2025-26 influenza season, which began unusually early in November 2025, shows heterogeneous progression across the region, with some countries reporting peaked activity while others appear to be approaching their epidemic peaks. This seasonal timing represents the earliest sustained influenza activity observed in recent years.\nInfluenza virus detection rates remain high across sentinel surveillance networks, with influenza A continuing to dominate. Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses are co-circulating, though relative proportions vary by country and week. Influenza B detections remain sporadic and at low levels. Age-stratified surveillance data indicate that children aged 5-14 years represent the primary demographic group driving community transmission, with increases observed both in mild illness presentations in primary care settings and more severe disease requiring hospitalization. Despite overall hospitalization rates decreasing compared to early January 2026, adults aged 65 years and over continue to account for the majority of hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths attributable to influenza. This age-stratified disease burden pattern is consistent with historical influenza epidemiology, wherein infection rates are highest among school-age children while severe outcomes concentrate among elderly adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions.\nEarly estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness for the 2025-26 season published by ECDC on 19 December 2025 show concordance with estimates for A(H3N2) viruses published by other countries, suggesting the vaccine formulation provides moderate protection against circulating strains. However, vaccine uptake remains suboptimal in many EU/EEA countries, particularly among high-risk populations who would benefit most from protection against severe outcomes. Given the early season onset and current high circulation levels, ECDC continues to urge eligible individuals to receive influenza vaccination without delay, as substantial seasonal activity persists and vaccination remains beneficial even after season onset.\nRespiratory syncytial virus circulation is elevated and continues to increase across the EU/EEA, representing a continuation of trends observed in recent weeks. The current RSV season began later than the previous two seasons, with activity typically peaking in late autumn or early winter. Children under five years of age are disproportionately affected by RSV infection and account for most hospitalizations. RSV characteristically causes bronchiolitis in infants, presenting with cough, wheezing, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. Young infants, particularly those under six months, premature infants, and children with underlying cardiac or pulmonary conditions face highest risk for severe disease requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. The concurrent elevation of both influenza and RSV activity places strain on pediatric healthcare services, with some countries reporting capacity challenges in pediatric wards and pediatric intensive care units.\nSARS-CoV-2 circulation remains low across all age groups throughout the EU/EEA. The number of hospitalisations attributable to COVID-19 is currently limited compared to influenza and RSV. Variant surveillance based on limited sequencing data from five EU/EEA countries for weeks 2-3 of 2026 shows XFG remains the dominant variant at 47.6% median proportion, with NB.1.8.1 at 23.1% and newly designated variant under monitoring BA.3.2 at 6.7%. The variant of interest BA.2.86 represents 0.0% of sequenced samples. Low overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission, reduced reporting, and limited testing volumes constrain accurate assessment of variant dynamics.\nEuroMOMO reports substantially elevated levels of all-cause mortality during Week 6, primarily driven by increased mortality in several countries in age groups above 65 years. This elevation is consistent with the combined burden of circulating respiratory viruses, particularly influenza, and seasonal factors affecting elderly populations during winter months. The mortality signal underscores the public health importance of interventions to protect vulnerable populations during periods of high respiratory virus transmission.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nNorovirus Outbreak at Winter Olympic Games\nThe organizing committee for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games reported a norovirus outbreak among the Finnish female ice hockey team at the Olympic Village on 4 February 2026. Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide and notorious for causing outbreaks in closed or semi-closed settings including cruise ships, hotels, hospitals, schools, and sporting event venues. The virus is extremely contagious, with very low infectious dose (10-100 viral particles), multiple transmission routes including person-to-person contact, contaminated food and water, and environmental surfaces, and environmental stability allowing prolonged survival on surfaces. Clinical illness typically begins 12-48 hours post-exposure with sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, generally self-limiting within 24-72 hours though dehydration may occur, particularly in young children and elderly adults.\nThe source of infection remains under investigation. Finnish health authorities confirmed that disease control measures are in place including isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and physical distancing protocols. These interventions align with established norovirus outbreak management principles emphasizing rapid case identification and isolation, thorough environmental disinfection with appropriate agents (quaternary ammonium compounds are ineffective; chlorine-based disinfectants or other EPA-registered products with demonstrated norovirus efficacy are required), exclusion of ill individuals from food handling and competition for at least 48 hours after symptom resolution, and emphasis on hand hygiene, though alcohol-based hand sanitizers have limited efficacy against norovirus and handwashing with soap and water is preferable.\nECDC initiated monitoring of communicable disease events associated with the Winter Olympic Games on 2 February 2026 and continues surveillance through close collaboration with Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità). The Games, taking place from 4-22 February 2026 with venues spanning Northern Italy including Milan, Cortina d’Ampezzo, Valtellina, Val di Fiemme, and Anterselva, are expected to attract more than one million cumulative attendees. Mass gathering events create elevated risk for communicable disease transmission due to crowding, international travel bringing together populations with varying immunity profiles and pathogen exposures, shared facilities, and potential strain on local public health and healthcare systems. The probability of EU/EEA citizens acquiring communicable diseases during the Winter Olympics remains low if general preventive measures are applied, including vaccination according to national schedules, hand and respiratory hygiene, appropriate food handling, self-isolation when symptomatic, and seeking prompt medical attention if needed.\n\n\n\nMpox: Evolution of Clade I Transmission Patterns\nThe global mpox epidemiological situation continues to evolve, with both clade I and clade II circulating. On the African continent, the five countries reporting most confirmed and suspected clade I cases in 2025 were Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, and Zambia. According to WHO, during the past six weeks ending 1 February 2026, most confirmed clade I cases were reported by DRC and Madagascar (253 and 196 cases, respectively). Madagascar reported confirmed mpox clade Ib cases for the first time in December 2025, with confirmed cases subsequently reported from eight regions and suspected cases from 20 of 24 regions. Comoros reported four clade Ib cases imported from Madagascar in January 2026. Overall, a decreasing trend in clade I mpox cases has been reported from Africa since May 2025, though week-to-week fluctuations occur.\nIn the EU/EEA, travel-associated or locally-acquired clade I cases have been reported by Sweden (2024), Germany (2024-2025), Belgium (2024-2025), France, Ireland, Italy, and Spain (2025), Greece (October 2025), Romania (December 2025), and Czechia (January 2026). Since October 2025, a new transmission pattern has emerged with Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain reporting mpox clade I in men without travel history. In the Netherlands and Spain, these were men reporting sexual contact with other males. The United States reported three clade I cases in California without travel history, with phylogenetic analysis indicating the sequences cluster with a previously reported travel-associated case, and epidemiological investigation indicating possible ongoing transmission among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and their social networks.\nConfirmed limited secondary transmission of clade I within households has been reported in the EU/EEA primarily among household contacts since 2024 by Germany, Belgium, and Ireland. Outside the EU/EEA and Africa, secondary transmission has been reported in the United Kingdom, China, Qatar, and Australia, with the number of secondary cases remaining low (range 1-6 cases per event). Based on available information, all transmission events resulted from close contact with no deaths reported. ECDC updated its classification of transmission patterns on 3 February 2026, categorizing countries as having either “community transmission” or “travel-associated cases or limited transmission” based on epidemiological data adequacy and observed transmission patterns. Countries with community transmission include Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, and Zambia.\nECDC’s assessment considers the risk of clade Ib infection moderate for men who have sex with men and low for the general population in the EU/EEA, reflecting current evidence and considerable uncertainties around transmissibility and severity of clade Ib infection relative to clade IIb. The detection of autochthonous transmission among men who have sex with men indicates the virus is following transmission patterns similar to clade IIb, which has circulated at low levels in sexual networks in countries worldwide since 2022. Primary preventive vaccination strategies should prioritize gay, bisexual, and transgender people and men who have sex with men at higher risk of exposure based on epidemiological or behavioral criteria, alongside individuals at risk of occupational exposure. Post-exposure preventive vaccination should target close contacts of cases. Healthcare providers should maintain awareness of mpox as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with characteristic rash, particularly those with epidemiological risk factors."

Of the 143 cases, 57 were classified as possible, 77 as probable, and 9 as confirmed through laboratory testing.

Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered 793 gastroenteritis cases compared to 778 during the same period in 2025, representing a modest 1.9% increase that does not fully capture the sharp week-over-week acceleration observed in recent weeks.\nAcute gastroenteritis encompasses a spectrum of etiologies including viral pathogens (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus), bacterial agents (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia), and parasitic organisms (Giardia, Cryptosporidium). In temperate climates during winter months, viral etiologies predominate, with norovirus responsible for the majority of epidemic gastroenteritis in all age groups. Norovirus exhibits peak activity during cooler months, thrives in closed or semi-closed settings, demonstrates extreme contagiousness with infectious doses as low as 10-100 viral particles, and spreads through person-to-person contact, contaminated food and water, and environmental surfaces. Clinical presentation typically includes sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, with illness generally self-limiting within 24-72 hours, though dehydration may necessitate medical attention, particularly among young children, elderly adults, and immunocompromised individuals.\nThe 29.4% week-over-week increase likely reflects multiple contributing factors. Post-holiday transmission following increased social mixing during New Year celebrations and Orthodox Christmas (celebrated 7 January in Bulgaria) creates conditions for respiratory and enteric pathogen transmission. Return to school and workplace settings after holiday breaks facilitates introduction of pathogens into households and communities. Winter conditions favor persistence of enteric viruses in the environment and on surfaces. Additionally, reporting patterns may reflect healthcare-seeking behavior changes as routine medical services resume full capacity following holiday periods.\nPublic health authorities should emphasize prevention measures during periods of elevated gastroenteritis transmission. Hand hygiene with soap and water (alcohol-based sanitizers have limited efficacy against norovirus) represents the single most important preventive measure. Proper food handling and preparation, thorough cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces using chlorine-based or other appropriate disinfectants, exclusion of symptomatic individuals from food handling and childcare/healthcare settings for at least 48 hours after symptom resolution, and prompt medical attention for individuals developing signs of dehydration (decreased urine output, lethargy, dry mucous membranes) are critical. Healthcare facilities should maintain vigilance for potential norovirus outbreaks and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures including contact precautions for affected patients.\n\n\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nVaricella Remains Elevated; Scarlet Fever Activity Continues\nVaricella cases totaled 563 during Week 6, representing a minimal increase of 5 cases (0.9%) compared to Week 5. Of the 563 cases, 75 were classified as possible, 440 as probable, and 48 as confirmed. Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered 3,448 varicella cases compared to 3,970 during the same period in 2025, representing a 13.1% decrease (522 fewer cases). Despite this year-over-year reduction, current weekly case counts remain elevated and consistent with typical late-winter varicella transmission patterns. Varicella (chickenpox), caused by varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious with secondary attack rates exceeding 90% among susceptible household contacts. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and aerosols from respiratory secretions and through direct contact with vesicular fluid from skin lesions. The incubation period ranges from 10-21 days (typically 14-16 days), with infectivity beginning 1-2 days before rash onset and continuing until all lesions have crusted over, usually 5-7 days after rash appearance.\nScarlet fever, caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) producing erythrogenic toxins, was reported in 63 cases during Week 6, representing a slight decrease of 3 cases (4.5%) compared to Week 5. Of the 63 cases, 14 were classified as possible, 22 as probable, and 27 as confirmed. Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered 342 scarlet fever cases compared to 558 during the same period in 2025, representing a substantial 38.7% decrease (216 fewer cases). This marked reduction continues favorable trends observed throughout early 2026 and may reflect multiple factors including natural fluctuations in Group A Streptococcus strain circulation, possible effects of increased antibiotic use during the respiratory virus season treating bacterial complications or co-infections, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, or reporting variations.\nScarlet fever presents with sudden onset of fever, sore throat, headache, and characteristic sandpaper-textured erythematous rash that typically begins on the chest and abdomen before spreading to extremities, with circumoral pallor and strawberry tongue as distinctive features. The disease predominantly affects children aged 5-15 years and transmits through respiratory droplets and direct contact with respiratory secretions. While generally self-limiting with appropriate antibiotic therapy, Group A Streptococcus can cause suppurative complications including peritonsillar abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, otitis media, and sinusitis, as well as non-suppurative post-infectious complications including acute rheumatic fever (which can lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The decline in scarlet fever cases is epidemiologically favorable, though continued surveillance remains important given the potential for serious complications and the periodicity of invasive Group A Streptococcus infections.\n\n\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nCOVID-19 Activity Declines; Pertussis Remains Suppressed\nCOVID-19 cases decreased substantially during Week 6, with 22 confirmed cases reported representing a 38.9% decline (14 fewer cases) compared to the 36 cases reported in Week 5. All reported cases were laboratory-confirmed through PCR or rapid antigen testing. Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered 237 COVID-19 cases compared to 192 during the same period in 2025, representing a 23.4% increase (45 additional cases). However, this year-over-year comparison should be interpreted cautiously given dramatically reduced testing volumes, changes in testing indications focusing primarily on hospitalized patients and high-risk individuals, and evolution of surveillance systems from comprehensive case detection toward sentinel monitoring during the endemic phase of SARS-CoV-2 circulation.\nThe 38.9% week-over-week decrease likely reflects multiple factors including genuine reduction in transmission intensity, decreased healthcare-seeking behavior for mild respiratory illness as the post-holiday period progresses, and possible shifts in testing practices. Current SARS-CoV-2 circulation across the EU/EEA remains low relative to influenza and RSV, with limited hospitalizations attributable to COVID-19. Variant surveillance data from limited sequencing across Europe shows XFG as the dominant circulating variant, with emerging variant BA.3.2 detected at low but increasing proportions in some countries. While population-level hybrid immunity (from prior infections and vaccination) provides substantial protection against severe disease, older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with underlying conditions remain at risk for severe outcomes and should be prioritized for vaccination, particularly with updated formulations targeting currently circulating variants.\nPertussis (whooping cough) surveillance reported zero cases during Week 6, unchanged from Week 5. Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered only 3 pertussis cases compared to 23 during the same period in 2025, representing an 87.0% decrease (20 fewer cases). This dramatic reduction continues the favorable trend observed throughout early 2026 and contrasts sharply with several other EU/EEA countries reporting elevated or increasing pertussis activity. Pertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, manifests with paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and post-tussive vomiting, with the catarrhal stage (when patients are most contagious but symptoms are mild and nonspecific) preceding the characteristic paroxysmal stage by 1-2 weeks. Infants, particularly those too young to have received complete primary vaccination series, face highest risk for severe disease including apnea, pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, and death.\nThe sustained low pertussis activity in Bulgaria may reflect multiple factors including maintenance of high routine vaccination coverage preventing sustained transmission, favorable epidemiological phase in natural pertussis cycles (which demonstrate 3-5 year periodicity), possible under-recognition or under-reporting of cases given nonspecific presentation during catarrhal stage, or reduced testing. Despite current low activity, pertussis represents an important vaccine-preventable disease requiring continued surveillance vigilance. Healthcare providers should maintain clinical suspicion for pertussis in patients presenting with prolonged cough (&gt;2 weeks) particularly if paroxysmal, and should ensure testing of suspected cases to enable appropriate treatment, contact management, and surveillance. Vaccination programs must sustain high coverage with primary infant series and recommended booster doses during adolescence and adulthood to maintain population immunity.\n\n\n\nBloodborne Transmission\n\nAcute Viral Hepatitis Increase Continues with Sustained Year-Over-Year Elevation\nAcute viral hepatitis ABCDEN cases totaled 34 during Week 6, representing a 20.9% decrease (9 fewer cases) compared to the 43 cases reported in Week 5. All 34 cases were laboratory-confirmed. Despite the week-over-week decline, year-to-date surveillance through Week 6 reveals a dramatic and sustained increase, with Bulgaria registering 219 acute viral hepatitis cases compared to 89 during the same period in 2025, representing a 146.1% increase (130 additional cases). This substantial year-over-year elevation continues the concerning trend documented in previous surveillance reports and warrants urgent public health investigation to determine specific etiologies driving the increase, affected populations, risk factors, and potential links to contaminated exposures or source patients.\nAcute viral hepatitis encompasses infections with hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV, which requires concurrent HBV infection), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). These viruses differ markedly in transmission routes, at-risk populations, clinical severity, and potential for chronic infection. HAV and HEV transmit primarily through fecal-oral routes via contaminated food and water, cause only acute infection without chronic sequelae (though HEV can cause chronic infection in immunocompromised individuals), and present particular risk from inadequately cooked shellfish, contaminated produce, and travel to endemic regions. HBV, HCV, and HDV transmit through percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infectious blood and body fluids, including sharing of injection drug equipment, unprotected sexual contact (particularly for HBV), healthcare-associated exposures with inadequate infection control, vertical transmission from infected mother to infant during delivery, and, historically, transfusion of contaminated blood products (though this route has been virtually eliminated in countries with modern blood safety systems).\nThe 146.1% year-over-year increase demands urgent etiologic clarification. Detailed case investigation should determine specific viral etiologies (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV), demographic characteristics of affected individuals, geographic distribution, temporal clustering, risk factor profiles, and potential epidemiological links. Key investigative questions include: Is the increase attributable to a single viral etiology or multiple? Are cases concentrated in particular risk groups (people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, healthcare workers)? Is there evidence of a common source exposure (contaminated food or water for HAV/HEV, infected source patient for HBV/HCV/HDV)? Have testing practices or case definitions changed? Are there reporting artifacts?\nIf the increase predominantly reflects HAV, investigation should focus on food-borne or water-borne sources, person-to-person transmission in high-risk settings (households with young children, daycare centers), and travel-associated cases. If HBV predominates, focus should include vaccination coverage assessment, screening and management of pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission, risk behaviors including unprotected sexual contact and injection drug use, and healthcare-associated transmission. If HCV drives the increase, particular attention to people who inject drugs, screening of high-risk populations, and linkage to curative direct-acting antiviral therapy is essential. Regardless of etiology, enhanced surveillance, targeted public health interventions, and monitoring of trends in subsequent weeks will be critical to characterizing and controlling this outbreak.\n\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\n\nGonorrhea Shows Substantial Year-Over-Year Increase\nGonorrhea cases totaled 7 during Week 6, representing an increase of 3 cases (75.0%) compared to the 4 cases reported in Week 5. All 7 cases were laboratory-confirmed through nucleic acid amplification testing or culture. Year-to-date through Week 6, Bulgaria has registered 23 gonorrhea cases compared to 7 during the same period in 2025, representing a 228.6% increase (16 additional cases). This substantial year-over-year elevation raises concern about potential increases in unprotected sexual activity, gaps in sexually transmitted infection prevention services, or changes in screening practices that may be detecting previously undiagnosed infections.\nGonorrhea, caused by the Gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ranks among the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections globally. Transmission occurs through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sexual contact with an infected partner, with infectivity risk per exposure depending on anatomical site (urethral, cervical, rectal, pharyngeal), sexual practices, and possibly bacterial strain characteristics. Infection manifests differently by anatomical site and sex. In males, urethral infection typically causes purulent urethral discharge and dysuria within 2-7 days post-exposure, though asymptomatic urethral infection occurs in approximately 10% of cases. In females, cervical infection frequently remains asymptomatic (up to 50% of cases) or causes nonspecific symptoms including vaginal discharge, dysuria, intermenstrual bleeding, or lower abdominal discomfort, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Rectal infection, which can occur through receptive anal intercourse or autoinoculation, often remains asymptomatic though may cause anorectal discomfort, discharge, or bleeding. Pharyngeal infection, transmitted through oral sexual contact, typically remains asymptomatic and may serve as an important reservoir for ongoing transmission.\nUntreated gonorrhea can lead to serious complications. In females, ascending infection causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in approximately 10-20% of untreated cervical infections, manifesting with lower abdominal pain, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharge. PID can result in chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility. In males, epididymitis represents the most common local complication, presenting with testicular pain and swelling. Disseminated gonococcal infection, occurring in 0.5-3% of untreated cases, manifests as arthritis-dermatitis syndrome with migratory polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, dermatitis with pustular skin lesions, and occasionally septic arthritis or, rarely, endocarditis or meningitis. Neonates born to mothers with untreated gonorrhea face risk of ophthalmia neonatorum, which can cause blindness without prompt treatment.\nThe 228.6% year-over-year increase in gonorrhea warrants enhanced surveillance and public health response. Detailed case investigation should characterize demographic profiles of affected individuals, geographic distribution, sexual networks, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolated strains. Particular attention should focus on antimicrobial resistance, as N. gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to successive classes of antimicrobials including sulfonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and, most recently, extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Current treatment recommendations in most settings rely on dual therapy combining ceftriaxone (250-500 mg intramuscularly) with azithromycin (1-2 grams orally), though resistance patterns continue to evolve. Public health interventions should emphasize sexually transmitted infection screening particularly for high-risk populations including individuals with multiple sexual partners, men who have sex with men, and young adults; promotion of consistent and correct condom use; partner notification and treatment; and linkage to comprehensive sexual health services including HIV and other STI testing."

    "text": "The Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak in Ethiopia, first confirmed on 14 November 2025, appears to be approaching its conclusion. As of 5 January 2026, no new cases have been reported since 12 December 2025, and no contacts remain under active monitoring — a period of 21 consecutive days without identified transmission. The outbreak has now entered the final observation period; per WHO and Ethiopian guidelines, official termination will be declared 42 days after the last patient tests negative and is discharged.\nMarburg virus belongs to the family Filoviridae and causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever with case fatality ratios historically approaching 88% in some outbreaks. Transmission occurs through direct contact with blood, secretions, or other bodily fluids of infected persons or animals, particularly fruit bats of the Rousettus genus, which serve as the natural reservoir. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 21 days, most commonly 5 to 10 days. Clinical presentation includes sudden onset fever, severe headache, myalgia, diarrhoea, vomiting, and in advanced stages, unexplained bleeding from mucosal surfaces.\nThe final outbreak toll stands at 17 cases (14 laboratory-confirmed, three probable) with 12 deaths, yielding a case fatality rate of 64.3% among confirmed cases. Geographic distribution was limited to two areas: Jinka town in South Ethiopia Regional State (the epicentre) and Hawassa City in Sidama Region, the latter affected by a single imported case. A total of 886 contacts were monitored, and five patients have recovered. Ethiopian authorities initiated vaccine trials using the cAd3-Marburg vaccine in the affected regions, with 2,500 doses distributed to healthcare workers and case contacts. Neighbouring countries including South Sudan, Kenya, and Somalia have intensified preparedness activities.\nThe ECDC risk assessment for EU/EEA citizens visiting or residing in Ethiopia remains low, with the likelihood of onward transmission within the EU/EEA assessed as very low given stringent infection prevention measures in European healthcare settings.\n\n\n\nMERS-CoV transmission continues at low levels on the Arabian Peninsula. Since the previous update on 10 December 2025, five new cases including one fatality have been reported in Saudi Arabia, with symptom onset between September and December 2025. Cases were distributed across Makkah (two), Riyadh (two), and Najran (one) regions. All patients were adults, with three aged over 65 years. Two cases reported direct camel contact, while the remaining three had no identified exposure to camels or camel products. No secondary transmission has been detected.\nMERS-CoV is a zoonotic betacoronavirus with dromedary camels serving as the intermediate host and primary source of human infection. The virus causes severe respiratory illness with a crude case fatality rate of approximately 36% among reported cases globally. Since 2012, a total of 2,647 cases including 959 deaths have been reported worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in Saudi Arabia. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily in healthcare settings but is limited in community contexts.\nFor 2025, Saudi Arabia has reported 17 cases with four fatalities, with an additional two imported cases identified in France. The probability of sustained human-to-human transmission in Europe remains very low, and the ECDC assessment characterises the current risk to the EU/EEA as low.\n\n\n\nChina reported seven new human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) infection since early November 2025, according to WHO’s monthly assessment published 19 December 2025. Cases were identified in Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, and Hubei provinces with symptom onset spanning September through November 2025. Five cases occurred in children and two in adults. Clinical presentation was mild in five individuals; two elderly patients required hospitalisation, one of whom had severe pneumonia complicated by underlying conditions.\nExposure assessment identified contact with backyard poultry in four cases and live poultry market attendance in two cases, with investigation ongoing for one case. No secondary transmission has been documented among contacts.\nA(H9N2) viruses circulate widely among poultry in Asia and pose intermittent zoonotic risk. Since 1998, 190 human cases including two deaths have been reported globally from ten countries. China has contributed 149 cases since 2015, with a case fatality rate of 1.4%. The virus typically causes mild respiratory illness without evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission capability. The ECDC assessment indicates very low risk to human health in the EU/EEA.\n\n\n\nWHO reported a single human case of Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) variant infection in Yunnan Province, China. The patient, a male farmer in his sixties, developed symptoms on 2 November 2025 following exposure to backyard pigs. Despite hospitalisation from 6 to 10 November, clinical course was mild. No secondary cases have been identified.\nSporadic human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses occur globally, typically following direct pig contact. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission has been documented rarely. Novel influenza viruses require thorough characterisation and reporting through International Health Regulations mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal cholera transmission persists at substantial levels. Between 24 November and 24 December 2025, 30,611 new cases and 275 deaths were reported worldwide. Year-to-date, 601,845 cases including 7,671 deaths have been documented in 2025, compared with 733,355 cases and 4,834 deaths during the equivalent period in 2024.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo leads current reporting with 8,374 new cases and 192 deaths in the past month, followed by Afghanistan (7,942 cases), Yemen (7,820 cases), South Sudan (1,599 cases), and Angola (1,398 cases). Cholera is a severe diarrhoeal disease caused by toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 and O139, characterised by profuse watery diarrhoea that can lead to rapid dehydration and death within hours if untreated. Case fatality rates below 1% are achievable with adequate rehydration therapy but exceed 50% when treatment access is limited.\nAfrica bears the greatest burden, with active transmission reported in 21 countries during the reporting period. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has accumulated 67,124 cases and 1,939 deaths in 2025, representing a substantial increase over 2024 figures. South Sudan’s outbreak is particularly severe, with 79,633 cumulative cases and 1,277 deaths — a dramatic escalation from 114 cases in the same period of 2024. Sudan’s protracted conflict continues to drive transmission, with 72,057 cases and 2,077 deaths reported in 2025.\nAngola’s outbreak, which commenced in 2025, has now reached 36,077 cases with 892 deaths. Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe continue reporting new cases, while Chad’s outbreak has largely subsided.\nThe risk of cholera infection for travellers remains low, though sporadic importation to the EU/EEA is possible. In 2023, 12 confirmed cases were reported by five EU/EEA countries, all with travel history to affected regions. Vaccination is recommended only for emergency and relief workers at elevated exposure risk; travellers should observe standard food and water hygiene precautions."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: European Union/European Economic Area\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nSeasonal Respiratory Virus Surveillance\nThe EU/EEA respiratory virus season remains at elevated intensity as of Week 1, 2026. Syndromic surveillance demonstrates elevated consultation rates for acute respiratory illness in most reporting countries, indicating substantial circulating respiratory pathogen activity.\nInfluenza virus circulation continues to increase across the region, though some countries appear to have passed peak activity. Influenza A(H3N2) dominates at the EU/EEA level, accounting for 76% of subtyped specimens in primary care surveillance (170 A(H3N2) versus 46 A(H1N1)pdm09 in Week 1). Cumulatively since Week 40, 2025, 5,120 A(H3N2) and 1,601 A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been reported. Genetic characterisation reveals that 91% of A(H3N2) viruses belong to subclade 2a.3a.1(K), while 99% of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses fall within subclade 5a.2a.1(D.3.1). Influenza B circulation remains minimal, with only 30 detections season-to-date, predominantly B/Victoria lineage.\nTest positivity in primary care reached 39% (pooled) with a country median of 37% (IQR: 30–48%). Hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection surveillance shows influenza positivity of 35% (pooled, 41% median), reflecting continued disease severity. Of 22 countries reporting intensity, five reported high activity, nine medium, four low, and two baseline. Geographic spread was classified as widespread in 17 of 21 reporting countries, regional in one, and sporadic in three.\nHospitalisation rates are elevated, particularly among adults aged 65 years and above. Early estimates of 2025-2026 seasonal vaccine effectiveness published by ECDC in December 2025 align with assessments from the United Kingdom and Canada for A(H3N2) protection.\nRespiratory syncytial virus activity continues its gradual seasonal increase, with pooled test positivity of 8.8% in primary care (median 6%, IQR: 4.1–11%) and 8.5% in hospitals (median 6.3%, IQR: 2.9–15%). RSV-A predominates, accounting for 60% of subtyped specimens. Hospital admissions are concentrated among children under five years, though EU/EEA-level hospitalisations remain below the four-season baseline for this time of year.\nSARS-CoV-2 circulation continues to decline across all age groups, with pooled test positivity of 3.3% in primary care and 3.0% in hospitals. The XFG variant under monitoring accounts for the majority of sequenced specimens in the single reporting country.\nAll surveillance data remain provisional and subject to reporting delays, incomplete country coverage, and variable testing practices. Countries with high testing volumes may disproportionately influence pooled estimates."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Bulgaria\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 notifications increased by 68% week-over-week, with 57 cases reported in Week 2 compared to 34 in Week 1. Year-to-date, 91 cases have been recorded versus 69 in the same period of 2025, representing a 32% increase. All reported cases were laboratory-confirmed. This uptick aligns with broader European patterns of continued low-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission, though absolute numbers remain modest compared to previous years.\n\n\nVaricella\nVaricella notifications surged in Week 2, with 1,001 cases reported representing an increase of 723 cases (260%) from the 278 cases registered in Week 1. This post-holiday acceleration reflects the typical epidemiological pattern of increased transmission following school reconvening and family gatherings. Case classification included 121 possible, 789 probable, and 91 confirmed cases. Year-to-date cumulative incidence stands at 1,279 cases, down 21% from 1,621 cases during the same period in 2025.\nVaricella-zoster virus is highly transmissible via respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular fluid, with secondary attack rates approaching 90% in susceptible household contacts. The incubation period is typically 14 to 16 days. While generally mild in immunocompetent children, complications including bacterial superinfection, pneumonia, and neurological involvement occur more frequently in adolescents, adults, and immunocompromised individuals.\nThe geographic distribution shows Sofia-grad reporting the highest burden (282 cases), followed by Varna (109 cases), Plovdiv (66 cases), Burgas (57 cases), and Veliko Tarnovo (45 cases). The Sofia-grad concentration likely reflects population density and institutional transmission settings.\n\n\nScarlet Fever\nScarlet fever notifications increased by 133% week-over-week, from 15 cases in Week 1 to 35 cases in Week 2. Case classification included 10 possible, 17 probable, and eight confirmed cases. Despite the sharp weekly increase, year-to-date totals (50 cases) remain 38% below the 81 cases reported in the same period of 2025.\nScarlet fever is caused by group A Streptococcus pyogenes producing erythrogenic exotoxins. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, with an incubation period of two to five days. The characteristic presentation includes pharyngitis, fever, and a diffuse erythematous sandpaper-like rash, followed by desquamation. School-aged children (5-15 years) are most commonly affected. The observed week-over-week increase coincides with school return following winter holidays.\n\n\nPertussis\nTwo confirmed pertussis cases were reported in Week 2, after no cases in Week 1. Year-to-date notifications (two cases) remain below the seven cases recorded in the same period of 2025. Pertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, remains a vaccine-preventable disease of ongoing concern, particularly given observed multi-year epidemic cycling and potential waning immunity in adolescents and adults who can serve as transmission sources to vulnerable infants.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nAcute Viral Hepatitis\nAcute viral hepatitis represents the most epidemiologically concerning signal in Week 2 Bulgarian surveillance. A total of 44 cases were reported, representing a 120% increase from 20 cases in Week 1. Year-to-date cumulative notifications reach 64 cases, compared with only 18 during the same period in 2025 — a 256% increase.\nCase classification included 40 confirmed, two probable, and two possible cases. The predominance of confirmed cases suggests robust diagnostic ascertainment. Geographic distribution shows concentration in Plovdiv (one case), Pleven (11 cases), and Haskovo (four cases), with cases distributed across multiple additional regions.\nThe magnitude of year-over-year increase warrants urgent epidemiological investigation to determine the predominant viral aetiology, identify transmission settings, and characterise affected populations. Common source outbreaks of hepatitis A linked to contaminated food products or person-to-person transmission in specific communities require distinct public health responses.\n\n\nGastroenteritis and Enterocolitis\nGastroenteritis and enterocolitis notifications nearly doubled, with 205 cases in Week 2 compared to 109 in Week 1 (88% increase). Case classification included 74 possible, 122 probable, and nine confirmed cases. Year-to-date cumulative notifications (314 cases) exceed the 2025 baseline (271 cases) by 16%.\nThis syndromic category encompasses multiple enteric pathogens. The post-holiday increase likely reflects multiple factors including delayed healthcare-seeking during holiday periods, increased social mixing, and potential foodborne exposures associated with festive gatherings. Sofia-grad (42 cases), Plovdiv (66 cases), Varna (27 cases), and Lovech (12 cases) reported the highest burdens.\n\n\nSalmonellosis\nSalmonellosis notifications doubled week-over-week, with 18 cases in Week 2 versus nine in Week 1. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Year-to-date cumulative notifications (27 cases) exceed the 2025 baseline (eight cases) by 238%, representing a substantial and concerning increase.\nNon-typhoidal Salmonella species cause acute gastroenteritis characterised by diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal cramping, typically 12 to 72 hours after consumption of contaminated food — most commonly poultry, eggs, or products containing raw eggs. Person-to-person transmission can occur. The pronounced year-over-year increase warrants investigation for potential common source outbreaks or detection of emerging serotypes.\n\n\nCampylobacteriosis\nNine campylobacteriosis cases were reported in Week 2, up from seven in Week 1 (29% increase). All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Year-to-date notifications (16 cases) represent a 300% increase compared to four cases in the same period of 2025.\nCampylobacter species, predominantly C. jejuni and C. coli, represent the leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in many industrialised countries. Transmission typically occurs through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk, or contaminated water, with an incubation period of two to five days. While usually self-limited, complications include reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The substantial year-over-year increase parallels salmonellosis trends and may indicate common epidemiological drivers.\n\n\nRotavirus Gastroenteritis\nRotavirus gastroenteritis notifications increased from three cases in Week 1 to 11 cases in Week 2 (267% increase). All cases were laboratory-confirmed. However, year-to-date totals (14 cases) remain substantially below the 59 cases recorded in the same period of 2025, representing a 76% decrease.\nRotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoeal disease among young children globally. Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route with high secondary attack rates. The week-over-week increase following low holiday-period detection is typical surveillance behaviour; the year-over-year decrease may reflect ongoing impact of rotavirus vaccination programmes.\n\n\nEscherichiosis (Coliform Enteritis)\nThree cases of coliform enteritis were reported in Week 2, up from two in Week 1. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Year-to-date notifications (five cases) exceed the two cases reported in the same period of 2025.\n\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nMarked week-over-week increases were observed across multiple sexually transmitted infection categories. Urogenital chlamydia infections increased from one case in Week 1 to 11 cases in Week 2, with year-to-date totals (12 cases) exceeding the 2025 baseline (five cases) by 140%. Gonorrhoea similarly increased from one to seven cases week-over-week, with year-to-date notifications (eight cases) above the three reported in the same period of 2025.\nSyphilis notifications declined from four cases in Week 1 to two cases in Week 2, with year-to-date totals (six cases) below the 2025 baseline (12 cases). HIV diagnoses numbered three in Week 2 (none in Week 1), with year-to-date notifications (three cases) below the ten recorded in the same period of 2025.\nChlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are bacterial sexually transmitted infections frequently presenting as urethritis, cervicitis, or asymptomatic infection. Both can ascend to cause pelvic inflammatory disease with potential for tubal scarring and infertility. The substantial week-over-week increases likely reflect post-holiday diagnostic testing patterns rather than acute transmission surges, though sustained elevated reporting warrants monitoring.\n\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\n\nLyme Borreliosis\nTwo Lyme borreliosis cases were reported in Week 2, down from three in Week 1. Year-to-date notifications (five cases) are slightly below the six cases reported in the same period of 2025. Winter detection reflects the prolonged incubation and diagnostic workup timeline rather than active tick exposure during January."

    "text": "Key Surveillance Observations\nThe Week 2 Bulgarian surveillance data demonstrate several patterns warranting public health attention. The acute viral hepatitis surge (+256% year-over-year) constitutes the most significant signal and requires rapid epidemiological assessment to characterise the outbreak by viral aetiology, transmission setting, and affected populations. Concurrent increases in salmonellosis (+238% YTD), campylobacteriosis (+300% YTD), and general gastroenteritis suggest either enhanced surveillance ascertainment, common environmental exposures, or genuine increases in enteric pathogen transmission during the post-holiday period.\nAt the European level, respiratory virus circulation remains elevated with influenza A(H3N2) dominant. Hospitalisation rates in adults aged 65 years and above underscore the continued importance of vaccination for this population. The approaching conclusion of the Ethiopian Marburg outbreak represents a positive development, while ongoing global cholera transmission and sporadic zoonotic influenza cases maintain the need for international health surveillance vigilance."

    "text": "The European Medicines Agency’s December 2025 meeting yielded several clinically significant regulatory decisions that will impact patient care across the EU/EEA. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended conditional marketing authorization for Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept) for treatment of high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, addressing a significant unmet need given that bladder cancer affects over 200,000 people annually in the European Union, with most cases being this non-muscle invasive subtype. The conditional approval pathway reflects urgent therapeutic needs while additional confirmatory data are collected.\nThe committee recommended marketing authorization for Aumseqa (aumolertinib) for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, Exdensur (depemokimab) for severe eosinophilic asthma and severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and Myqorzo (aficamten) for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For COVID-19 prevention, Mnexspike (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) received positive opinion for individuals aged 12 years and above, expanding the vaccine portfolio available during the current winter season.\nTwo biosimilar medicines received positive opinions: Gotenfia (golimumab) for inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and Ranluspec (ranibizumab) for retinopathies. Biosimilars continue to improve access to biological therapies while reducing healthcare costs.\nParticularly noteworthy was the extension of Mounjaro (tirzepatide) indication to include adolescents and children from 10 years of age for treatment of type 2 diabetes that is not satisfactorily controlled. This expansion addresses growing concerns about pediatric type 2 diabetes linked to rising childhood obesity rates. The committee also recommended 11 other indication extensions for previously authorized medicines.\nThe CHMP issued a negative opinion for Blarcamesine Anavex (blarcamesine) intended for Alzheimer’s disease treatment, concluding that the main study failed to demonstrate effectiveness and safety in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease who do not have mutations in the SIGMAR1 gene. This decision underscores continued challenges in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and rigorous evidence standards maintained by regulatory authorities."

    "text": "Healthcare-Associated and Respiratory Transmission\nThe Marburg virus disease outbreak in Ethiopia showed no new confirmed cases during Week 50, with the last confirmed case reported on December 5. As of December 11, the outbreak totals 16 cases (13 laboratory-confirmed and three probable) with 11 deaths, yielding a case fatality rate of 61.5%. Contact tracing continues with 349 identified contacts, of whom 119 (34.1%) have completed their 21-day monitoring period without developing illness as of November 26.\nA significant development during the reporting period was the December 8 initiation of vaccine trials using the cAd3-Marburg vaccine in the two affected regions (South Ethiopia Regional State and Sidama Region). According to Africa CDC briefings on December 11, 2,500 doses have been provided and are being offered to healthcare professionals and contacts of cases. The implementation of monoclonal antibody treatment for cases represents another therapeutic advancement during this outbreak. Cases have been reported in Jinka city, Omo Zone (the epicenter) and Hawassa City, Sidama Region.\nThe Ethiopian Ministry of Health continues intensified response efforts including community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding. International partners including Africa CDC and WHO are supporting the response. The viral strain shows similarities to those previously identified in East Africa, and no cases have been detected outside Ethiopia.\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus surveillance detected two imported MERS cases in France during the reporting period, representing the first MERS cases in the EU/EEA since 2014. Both patients were part of the same travel group that visited the Arabian Peninsula. Crucially, no secondary transmission has been detected, demonstrating effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in EU/EEA healthcare settings."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\nInfluenza activity escalated during Week 50, with most EU/EEA countries now reporting widespread geographic spread at low-to-medium intensity. This represents the continuation of a season that began three to four weeks earlier than the previous two years, creating particular concern as peak transmission may coincide with the December holiday period when healthcare systems operate with reduced staffing and increased travel facilitates viral spread.\nIn Week 49 (the most recent week with complete virological data), 934 influenza-positive specimens were detected in primary care settings, with influenza A accounting for 99% of detections. Among typed specimens, A(H3N2) comprised 82% (587 cases) while A(H1N1)pdm09 represented 18% (128 cases). Only one influenza B detection was reported. Hospital surveillance revealed 398 influenza-positive samples, with A(H3N2) accounting for 63% and A(H1N1)pdm09 for 37% of typed specimens.\nGenetic characterization from Week 40-49 shows A(H3N2) subclade 2a.3a.1(K) predominating at 91% (277 of 305 characterized viruses), with smaller proportions of subclade 2a.3a.1(J.2) at 4%. The dominance of H3N2 is concerning as H3N2-predominant seasons historically result in higher morbidity and mortality, especially among older adults. Hospitalization increases are being observed across all age groups but primarily affecting adults aged 65 years and above.\nThe number of patients presenting to primary care with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection symptoms is elevated in approximately half of reporting countries. For Week 49, intensity data showed seven countries at baseline, two at low, and one at medium. Geographic spread data revealed seven countries with sporadic activity, two with regional spread, and 14 with widespread influenza transmission. Circulation is highest among children aged 5-14 years, though severe disease disproportionately affects older adults.\nECDC published a Threat Assessment Brief during this period assessing the risk of influenza for the EU/EEA in the context of increasing A(H3N2) subclade K circulation. Key recommendations include vaccination of all eligible populations particularly those at high risk, appropriate use of antivirals for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, use of face masks in healthcare and long-term care facilities, and healthcare system preparedness including surge capacity planning. These recommendations require urgent implementation given the current epidemiological situation and approaching festive period.\nRespiratory syncytial virus circulation is increasing slowly from low levels, though a slight decrease was observed in Week 49. In that week, 87 RSV-positive specimens were detected in primary care (3% positivity rate) with RSV-A and RSV-B each accounting for 50% of typed specimens. Hospital data showed 88 RSV-positive samples (6.2% positivity rate) with RSV-B accounting for 62% of typed specimens. Rising RSV-related hospital admissions are occurring primarily among children under five years in a few countries. Overall RSV circulation remains below levels observed at this time in the past four seasons.\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate but is decreasing across all age groups with currently limited impact on hospitalizations. In Week 49, 180 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were detected in primary care (6.2% positivity rate) and 65 positive samples in hospitals (4.5% positivity rate). Limited recent variant data shows XFG variant detected in one country (19 detections, 68% distribution) and NB.1.8.1 detected in one country (5 detections, 18% distribution).\nMeasles surveillance for October 2025 (the most recent month with complete data) shows 83 cases reported by nine EU/EEA countries, with 19 countries reporting zero cases. This represents a decrease compared with previous months, consistent with measles seasonality.\nSupplementary epidemic intelligence surveillance conducted December 9-10 detected one active outbreak in Poland with 26 cases in Podkarpacie region as of December 3. Local health authorities are performing active contact tracing, offering free vaccination, and limiting hospital visitations. Several EU/EEA countries reported sporadic cases: Ireland reported three cases in Week 48, all in the Dublin and North East region, with no other cases in the preceding 12 weeks. Germany reported 11 new cases between November 13 and December 9, bringing the 2025 total to 278 cases. The Netherlands reported 12 new cases between November 5 and December 3."

Varicella (chickenpox) cases totaled 583, representing an 18% increase from Week 49’s 494 cases (89 additional cases). The geographic distribution shows highest case counts in Sofia city (113 cases), Varna (68 cases), Stara Zagora (45 cases), and Plovdiv (40 cases), reflecting typical urban concentration of this highly transmissible infection during winter months.\nScarlet fever showed 102 cases in Week 50, a 27% increase from Week 49’s 74 cases (28 additional cases). The most affected regions were Sofia city (22 cases), Plovdiv (19 cases), Pleven (19 cases), and Sofia district (18 cases). This increase is consistent with winter seasonal patterns for group A streptococcal infections, though notably lower than 2024 levels during the same period.\nPertussis surveillance detected three confirmed cases in Week 50 compared to zero cases in Week 49, distributed in Blagoevgrad, Burgas, and Varna regions. These sporadic cases reflect endemic transmission at much lower levels than the 2024 pertussis resurgence that affected multiple European countries.\nCOVID-19 activity declined with 54 confirmed cases in Week 50, a 24% decrease from Week 49’s 71 cases (17 fewer cases). Cases were distributed across 17 regions with highest numbers in Sofia city (10 cases), Varna (6 cases), Burgas (3 cases), and Veliko Tarnovo (3 cases). This declining trend reflects continued high population immunity from vaccination and prior infection.\nViral meningitis and meningoencephalitis showed four cases in Week 50, doubling from two cases in Week 49. All four cases were classified as probable based on clinical presentation. One case of bacterial meningitis and meningoencephalitis was reported from Veliko Tarnovo."

The geographic distribution included Plovdiv (10 cases), Pleven (10 cases), Shumen (8 cases), Haskovo (7 cases), and Smolyan (4 cases). The continued elevated hepatitis activity compared to historical baselines warrants ongoing investigation to determine causative pathogens and transmission sources.\nGastroenteritis and enterocolitis cases numbered 181 in Week 50, a 21% increase from Week 49’s 149 cases (32 additional cases). The largest case numbers were reported from Plovdiv (35 cases), Sofia city (32 cases), Varna (26 cases), and Burgas (8 cases). This increase reflects typical winter gastroenteritis season onset with multiple viral and bacterial pathogens contributing to overall disease burden.\nSalmonellosis showed nine confirmed cases in Week 50, a decrease from 11 cases in Week 49. Cases were distributed across Burgas (2 cases), Plovdiv (1 case), Shumen (1 case), Sofia city (3 cases), Sofia district (1 case), and Yambol (1 case). The sporadic distribution suggests foodborne transmission from diverse sources rather than a common-source outbreak.\nCampylobacteriosis detected 10 confirmed cases in Week 50, increasing from six cases in Week 49 (67% increase). Cases were reported from Varna (2 cases), Pernik (1 case), Plovdiv (4 cases), Ruse (2 cases), and Sofia city (1 case). This increase may reflect enhanced laboratory detection or genuine increases in exposure to contaminated poultry or other sources.\nE. coli infections (coliform enteritis/escherichiosis) numbered 13 cases in Week 50, more than doubling from six cases in Week 49. Geographic distribution included Blagoevgrad (1 case), Burgas (1 case), Varna (1 case), Sofia city (3 cases), Plovdiv (5 cases), Ruse (1 case), and Stara Zagora (1 case). One shigellosis case was confirmed in Veliko Tarnovo, while nine rotavirus gastroenteritis cases were detected across six regions including Burgas, Varna, Gabrovo, Pernik, Plovdiv, and Sofia city."

Cases were reported from Varna (2 cases) and Pleven (1 case), consistent with endemic tick-borne disease transmission. One dengue case was confirmed in Week 50 (compared to zero in Week 49), likely representing a travel-associated infection given that sustained autochthonous dengue transmission has not been established in Bulgaria.\nQ fever showed one confirmed case in Week 50 from Plovdiv, compared to zero cases in Week 49. Q fever, caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii, is a zoonotic infection primarily transmitted through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from infected livestock, particularly sheep, goats, and cattle during parturition when the organism is shed in high concentrations in birth fluids and products. The infection can also occur through consumption of unpasteurized dairy products or direct contact with contaminated materials. In humans, Q fever presents with a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute disease with high fever, severe headache, myalgia, and atypical pneumonia, with chronic Q fever manifesting as endocarditis or vascular infections in approximately 1-5% of cases, particularly in individuals with pre-existing cardiac valve disease or immunocompromise. The single case detected in Plovdiv during Week 50 likely represents occupational or rural exposure to livestock, and warrants assessment of potential source farms and implementation of appropriate control measures. Bulgaria maintains endemic Q fever transmission in agricultural regions where small ruminant farming is common, and sporadic human cases occur throughout the year with some seasonal variation related to lambing and kidding seasons. No cases of other vector-borne diseases including West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis, or Mediterranean spotted fever were reported during Week 50."

Both cases were part of the same group trip. Contact tracing and monitoring are ongoing, with laboratory testing of symptomatic and paucisymptomatic contacts in progress. No secondary cases have been identified to date.\nMERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The virus is transmitted primarily through close contact with infected dromedary camels or their products (particularly raw milk), with limited human-to-human transmission occurring mainly in healthcare settings. The incubation period ranges from 2–14 days, with illness typically presenting as severe acute respiratory infection, though asymptomatic and mild cases occur. Case fatality rates historically exceed 30%, with higher mortality among individuals with underlying conditions. The Arabian Peninsula remains the epicenter, with 12 cases including 3 deaths reported in Saudi Arabia during 2025. Since 2012, a cumulative 2,640 cases and 958 deaths have been documented globally.\nThe probability of sustained human-to-human transmission in Europe remains very low, and the overall risk to the EU/EEA population is assessed as low. However, these cases serve as a reminder that sporadic importation of MERS-CoV can occur and European surveillance systems must maintain vigilance for travel-associated respiratory illness."

    "text": "Avian Influenza A(H5N2) – Genetic Analysis Update\nAdditional genetic analysis has been completed for the second human case of avian influenza A(H5N2) in Mexico, confirmed on 24 November 2025. The sequenced strain (A/Mexico City/INER INF1427/2025) belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b and, unlike the first case from 2024 which involved low pathogenic avian influenza, demonstrates a highly pathogenic avian influenza signature in the hemagglutinin segment.\nNotably, the strain appears to result from a reassortment event between an enzootic low pathogenic A(H5N2) virus ancestor from 2024 and A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.2 viruses, with a new genotype designation (B3.14) proposed. While no mutations known to increase zoonotic potential were identified in the consensus sequence, deeper analysis of sequencing reads revealed minor variants of K526R and E627K in PB2—markers associated with enhanced replication in mammalian cells. No human-to-human transmission has been detected. The risk of zoonotic influenza transmission to EU/EEA populations remains low."

    "text": "Vector-Borne, Contact and Sexual Transmission\n\nMarburg Virus Disease – Ethiopia (Update)\nThe Marburg virus disease outbreak in Ethiopia continues to evolve, with one additional confirmed case reported since 28 November 2025. As of 4 December, cumulative figures stand at 16 cases (13 laboratory-confirmed, 3 probable) with 11 deaths (8 confirmed, 3 probable), yielding a case fatality rate of 61.5% among confirmed cases—slightly lower than the 66.7% reported in week 48, likely reflecting improved supportive care and earlier case detection.\nGeographic expansion continues to be a concern. Cases have now been confirmed in two regions: Jinka city in Omo Zone, South Ethiopia Regional State (the outbreak epicenter), and Hawassa City in Sidama Region. The Hawassa case was confirmed in an individual who had returned from Jinka City, demonstrating inter-regional spread through population movement. Contact tracing has identified 349 individuals, with 119 (34.1%) having completed their 21-day monitoring period. Four cases have recovered and one patient remains under treatment.\nThe virus strain shows genetic similarities to previously identified East African Marburg variants. Response efforts continue under Ministry of Health leadership with WHO and international partner support, focusing on community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding. ECDC maintains its assessment of low overall risk for EU/EEA citizens visiting or living in Ethiopia, with very low likelihood of importation and secondary transmission.\n\n\nEbola Virus Disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo (Outbreak Concluded)\nOn 1 December 2025, WHO officially declared the end of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Kasai Province, DRC, following 42 days without new cases since the last patient’s discharge on 19 October 2025. This was the sixteenth Ebola outbreak recorded in DRC since 1976 and the eighth since 2018.\nThe final outbreak tally includes 64 cases (53 confirmed, 11 probable) and 45 deaths (34 confirmed, 11 probable), with an overall case fatality rate of 70.3%. All cases were confined to six health areas within Bulape health zone. A total of 19 patients recovered (29.7%), and all 1,735 contacts who were followed completed their monitoring. Vaccination efforts reached approximately 48,000 individuals, and 31 patients received monoclonal antibody therapy (mAb114).\nGenomic sequencing confirmed this outbreak represented a new zoonotic spillover event unrelated to previous outbreaks. The initial transmission was characterized by nosocomial spread and a superspreading event linked to the presumptive index case’s funeral. The DRC now enters a 90-day period of enhanced disease surveillance."

    "text": "Fecal-Oral Transmission\n\nShigellosis – Multi-Country Outbreak in Cape Verde Travelers (Resurgence)\nA recurrent multi-country outbreak of shigellosis among travelers returning from Cape Verde has resurged dramatically, with at least 193 cases reported across five EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom during 2025. This outbreak, which first emerged in September 2022, continues to demonstrate persistent transmission of the same Shigella sonnei strain, suggesting a common source or ongoing transmission route at specific tourist locations.\nShigella sonnei causes bacillary dysentery through fecal-oral transmission, with an incubation period of 1–3 days. Clinical presentation includes bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Transmission occurs through contaminated food or water or person-to-person spread. While typically self-limiting in healthy adults, severe disease can occur, particularly with antimicrobial-resistant strains. The outbreak strain demonstrates limited genetic antimicrobial resistance markers, though most isolates harbor dfrA1 predicting trimethoprim resistance.\nCountry-specific data reveal the outbreak’s scope: the UK has reported 137 confirmed cases since 1 October 2025, with 94% of those reporting travel indicating Cape Verde as their destination. Among cases with hotel information (n=75), 71 stayed at hotels in the Santa Maria and Boa Vista areas. Sweden reported 26 cases in 2025 (23 since late October), with co-infections of salmonellosis (4) and campylobacteriosis (1) also noted among returning travelers. France reported 21 cases (up from 5–6 annually in 2023–2024), the Netherlands reported 8 cases in September-October, and Ireland reported 1 case.\nAvailable case interviews consistently implicate a specific hotel/resort chain in the Santa Maria region of Sal island and on Boa Vista island—the same locations identified during the 2022 outbreak. The persistence of the same genomic strain over multiple years strongly suggests ongoing environmental contamination or systematic food safety failures at implicated accommodations. ECDC assesses the risk for EU/EEA citizens traveling to Cape Verde of contracting shigellosis as moderate."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nSeasonal Respiratory Virus Activity – Accelerating Influenza Season\nThe 2025–26 influenza season continues to accelerate across the EU/EEA, with approximately half of reporting countries now showing respiratory illness consultation rates above baseline. This represents significant ongoing respiratory virus circulation as winter progresses.\nInfluenza virus detection continues to increase, with most countries reporting widespread activity at low-to-medium intensity—a notable escalation from the previous week’s assessment. Influenza A remains dominant (99% of typed specimens), with A(H3N2) subclade 2a.3a.1(K) accounting for 88% of genetically characterized A(H3) specimens and driving the current increasing trend. In week 48, primary care sentinel surveillance detected 591 influenza specimens with 21% pooled positivity (median 13%; IQR 8.1–24%), while hospital SARI surveillance identified 305 influenza specimens with 19% pooled positivity. The week-on-week increase from 16% to 21% pooled positivity in primary care demonstrates the season’s rapid progression.\nGeographic spread has expanded considerably: 11 countries now report widespread activity (up from 5 the previous week), 3 report regional spread, 1 local, 5 sporadic, and only 1 reports no activity. Five countries report baseline intensity, 12 report low intensity, and 5 report medium intensity. Children aged 5–14 years continue to show the highest circulation rates, while hospitalization increases are primarily affecting adults aged 65 years and above.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) circulation is slowly increasing from low levels but remains below what was observed at this time in the past four seasons. Hospital data show rising RSV-related admissions in a few countries, primarily among children under five years. SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate but is decreasing across all age groups, with limited impact on hospitalizations.\nECDC’s Threat Assessment Brief published 20 November 2025, assessing the risk of influenza for the EU/EEA in the context of increasing A(H3N2) subclade K circulation, remains relevant as the season intensifies."

No new cases were reported in week 49, and eight previously reported cases were eliminated following epidemiological review.\nFinal 2025 season figures stand at 1,172 locally acquired cases across France (788) and Italy (384), distributed among 84 clusters. France’s cases occurred across 78 clusters (largest in Antibes), while Italy’s cases were distributed across 6 clusters (largest in the Emilia-Romagna region towns of Carpi, San Prospero, Soliera, and others). Three clusters in France and two in Italy remain technically active based on reporting windows, though transmission has likely ceased. The 2025 season represents significant local transmission, underscoring the importance of vector control and surveillance during favorable transmission periods.\n\n\nWest Nile Virus – Season Update\nSince the beginning of 2025 and as of 3 December, 14 European countries have reported human West Nile virus cases, with 157 affected areas identified. Bulgaria is among the reporting countries, along with Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and Türkiye. The vector transmission season has effectively concluded."

In 2024, 24,164 HIV diagnoses were reported across 30 EU/EEA countries (rate: 5.3 per 100,000), representing a 14.5% decrease from the 2015 rate of 6.2 per 100,000. However, this decline should be interpreted cautiously as standard reporting-delay adjustments were not applied.\nThe epidemic remains predominantly sexually transmitted (96%), with sex between men accounting for 48.3% (53.2% of known transmission routes) and heterosexual contact for 33.6% (45.7% of known routes). Migrants comprised 47.2% of all diagnoses; when excluding unknown origins, this proportion rises to 55.7%—a 45.4% increase from 2015’s 33.1%. Late diagnosis (CD4 &lt;350 cells/mm³) remains problematically high at 48.0%, indicating persistent gaps in testing access and awareness.\nAIDS diagnoses totaled 2,215 across 25 countries (rate: 0.7 per 100,000), with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (22.4%) and tuberculosis (11.7%) representing the most frequent AIDS-defining illnesses. These data underscore the continued need for expanded HIV testing, rapid linkage to care, pre-exposure prophylaxis programs, and harm reduction services."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nCOVID-19\nBulgaria recorded 71 COVID-19 cases during week 49, essentially unchanged from the previous week (69 cases, +2.9%). Year-to-date cases (3,030) represent an 80.0% reduction compared to 2024 (15,135), consistent with endemic circulation patterns and reduced surveillance intensity. All reported cases were laboratory confirmed.\n\nPertussis (Whooping Cough)\nNo pertussis cases were registered during week 49, representing a decrease of 3 cases from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (88) remain dramatically lower than 2024 (2,718), confirming the post-epidemic normalization following the 2024 surge that affected Bulgaria and much of Europe. The 96.8% year-to-date decrease demonstrates the cyclical nature of pertussis epidemiology following the disruption of childhood vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nLegionnaires’ Disease\nOne case of Legionnaires’ disease was confirmed during week 49, a decrease of 1 from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (16) exceed 2024 totals (11) by 45.5%, warranting continued environmental surveillance of water systems, particularly in healthcare facilities and hotels during the winter months when building water systems may be more susceptible to Legionella colonization.\n\n\nPneumococcal Bacterial Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis\nOne case of pneumococcal bacterial meningitis/meningoencephalitis was confirmed during week 49, following zero cases the previous week. Year-to-date cases (22) are unchanged from 2024 (22). Invasive pneumococcal disease remains an important cause of severe bacterial infection, particularly in young children and elderly adults.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\nSixty-three acute viral hepatitis cases were reported during week 49, representing a significant 43.2% increase from the previous week (44 cases). Of these, 57 were laboratory confirmed, 2 probable, and 4 possible. This week-to-week increase reverses the 48.8% decrease observed between weeks 47 and 48, demonstrating continued volatility in hepatitis transmission.\nYear-to-date cases (1,510) represent a 129.8% increase compared to 2024 (657), making viral hepatitis the most dramatically elevated disease category in Bulgarian surveillance this year. This substantial increase likely reflects the broader Central European hepatitis A outbreak affecting neighboring countries, though Bulgaria’s specific contribution by hepatitis type requires characterization. Given Bulgaria’s geographic proximity to heavily affected Hungary and Romania, enhanced surveillance for HAV among high-risk populations remains warranted.\nA total of 149 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis were recorded during week 49, a decrease of 20 cases (11.8%) from the previous week. Case classification included 62 possible, 84 probable, and 3 confirmed. Year-to-date cases (8,997) represent a 6.1% decrease compared to 2024 (9,577), consistent with secular trends.\nEleven salmonellosis cases were confirmed during week 49, representing a substantial 52.2% decrease from the previous week (23 cases). All cases were laboratory confirmed. Year-to-date cases (672) are 25.1% lower than 2024 (897). The marked week-to-week decrease suggests the previous week’s uptick may have represented a transient cluster rather than sustained transmission.\nSix campylobacteriosis cases were confirmed during week 49, a dramatic 68.4% decrease from the previous week (19 cases). Despite this weekly decrease, year-to-date cases (462) continue to exceed 2024 totals (322) by 43.5%. The persistent year-to-date increase throughout 2025 warrants continued investigation into potential sources and risk factors, even as weekly case counts fluctuate.\nSix escherichiosis cases were confirmed during week 49, a 200% increase from the previous week (2 cases). All cases were laboratory confirmed. Year-to-date cases (301) remain 14.2% below 2024 (351). The week-to-week variation likely reflects sporadic rather than outbreak-related transmission.\nTen rotavirus gastroenteritis cases were confirmed during week 49, unchanged from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (701) are 15.7% lower than 2024 (832), likely reflecting continued benefits of childhood rotavirus vaccination programs.\nOne confirmed shigellosis case was reported during week 49, unchanged from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (55) are 28.6% lower than 2024 (77). Given the multi-country S. sonnei outbreak affecting Cape Verde travelers, clinicians should maintain awareness of travel history in patients presenting with bloody diarrhea."

Year-to-date cases (381) are virtually unchanged from 2024 (383). The detection of cases in December is unusual given reduced tick activity during winter months and may represent delayed diagnosis of infections acquired during the transmission season.\n\n\nViral Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis\nTwo cases of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis were confirmed during week 49, following zero cases the previous week. Year-to-date cases (85) modestly exceed 2024 (78) by 9.0%.\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSexually transmitted infections in Bulgaria continue to demonstrate concerning upward trends across multiple pathogens.\nHIV recorded 7 cases during week 49, a notable 133% increase from the previous week (3 cases). Year-to-date cases (284) represent a 5.6% increase compared to 2024 (269). The week-to-week fluctuation likely reflects reporting variation rather than acute transmission changes, though the overall upward trend merits attention.\nSyphilis recorded 6 cases during week 49, a decrease of 4 from the previous week (10 cases). Year-to-date cases (348) represent a 10.5% increase compared to 2024 (315).\nCongenital syphilis recorded 1 additional case during week 49, bringing year-to-date totals to 35 cases compared to 16 in 2024—a 118.8% increase. This represents one of the most significant public health signals in Bulgarian surveillance, indicating systematic failures in prenatal syphilis screening and treatment programs. Each congenital syphilis case represents a preventable pediatric outcome requiring urgent programmatic attention.\nUrogenital chlamydia infection recorded 7 cases during week 49, an increase of 2 from the previous week (5 cases). Year-to-date cases (182) demonstrate a 75.0% increase compared to 2024 (104), the most pronounced increase among bacterial STIs.\nGonorrhea recorded 2 cases during week 49, a decrease of 3 from the previous week (5 cases). Year-to-date cases (116) represent a 28.9% increase compared to 2024 (90).\nThe consistent upward trends across all STI categories suggest systemic factors potentially including reduced prevention services, changing sexual behaviors, improved case detection, or some combination thereof."

    "text": "Потвърждаването на първата в света човешка инфекция с птичи грип A(H5N5) представлява сигнално събитие в надзора на зоонозните грипни вируси. Пациентът – възрастен човек със съпътстващи заболявания от окръг Грейс Харбър, щата Вашингтон – развива симптоми през 43-та седмица, е хоспитализиран през 45-та седмица и умира на 21 ноември 2025 г. Екологични проби от двора на пациента, където се отглеждат домашни птици, дават положителни резултати за птичи грип, което установява като най-вероятен източник на експозиция домашни птици, които са били в контакт с диви птици.\nВисокопатогенните вируси на птичи грип A(H5) причиняват тежко системно заболяване при птиците с леталитет, достигащ почти 100%, а човешките инфекции, макар и редки, могат да доведат до тежко респираторно заболяване с висок коефициент на леталитет. Инкубационният период обикновено варира между 2 и 8 дни. Най-висок риск от инфекция имат лица, които имат директен контакт със заразени птици, техните секрети или контаминирани повърхности в околната среда.\nСеквенираният изолат (A/Washington/2148/2025) принадлежи към клада 2.3.4.4b, генотип A6, която е установена при птици и бозайници в Северна Америка и е означена като EA-2021-I при европейските изолати. Критично важно е, че не са идентифицирани мутации, асоциирани с адаптация към бозайници, и не е установено предаване от човек на човек сред контактните лица на пациента. Този генетичен профил е в съответствие с щамовете, циркулиращи при диви птици в Северна Европа през текущата епидемиологична година, където седем страни от ЕС/ЕИП съобщават за детекции. Допълнително A(H5N5) е идентифициран и при диви бозайници, включително арктическа лисица, рис и американска норка в Исландия и Норвегия от началото на 2024 г.\nCDC на САЩ оценява риска за общото население като нисък, и тази оценка се пренася и за населението на ЕС/ЕИП. Въпреки това глобалната значимост на този първи човешки случай с A(H5N5) налага засилен надзор, особено за лица с професионална или рекреационна експозиция на домашни птици и диви птици.\n\n\n\nНа 24 ноември 2025 г. СЗО потвърждава втори глобален човешки случай на инфекция с птичи грип A(H5N2), регистриран при млада жена без съпътстващи заболявания в Мексико Сити. Пациентката е била експонирана на птици и куче, което дава положителен резултат за A(H5) в района, където живее. За разлика от първия човешки случай, съобщен през април 2024 г. (причинен от нископатогенен птичи грип), настоящият щам демонстрира високопатогенен профил в сегмента на хемаглутинина, но не носи мутации, известни като повишаващи зоонозния потенциал. Не е установено предаване от човек на човек, а рискът за населението на ЕС/ЕИП остава нисък.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЕтиопия преживява първото си в историята огнище на болест, причинена от вируса Марбург, потвърдено на 14 ноември 2025 г. след установяване на подозрителни случаи в град Джинка в региона на Южните нации, националности и народи. Към 27 ноември са съобщени 15 случая (12 лабораторно потвърдени и 3 вероятни) и 11 смъртни изхода, което съответства на коефициент на леталитет 66,7%.\nВирусът Марбург причинява тежка хеморагична треска с исторически регистрирани коефициенти на леталитет до 88% при някои огнища. Вирусът се предава чрез директен контакт с кръвта и други телесни течности на заразени хора или животни, като инкубационният период обичайно е 5–10 дни (диапазон 3–21 дни). Плодоядните прилепи от семейство Pteropodidae служат като естествен резервоар. Клиничната картина се характеризира с внезапно начало на фебрилитет, силно главоболие, мускулни болки и изразена умора, последвани от гастроинтестинални симптоми, а в по-късните стадии – от необясними кръвоизливи. Медицинските специалисти са изложени на особено висок професионален риск, като вече са съобщени два смъртни изхода сред здравни работници.\nТревожен аспект на текущото огнище е географското разширяване към град Хаваса в регион Сидама след завръщане на пътувал от Джинка, което показва потенциал за по-широка дисеминация. При проследяване на контактните лица са идентифицирани 349 души, като 119 от тях вече са завършили 21-дневния период на наблюдение. Цялогеномното секвениране установява сходство с по-рано идентифицирани източноафрикански щамове. СЗО и здравните власти на Етиопия координират мерки за отговор, включително засилен надзор, проследяване на контактните лица и ангажиране на общностите.\nECDC оценява риска за гражданите на ЕС/ЕИП, които посещават или живеят в Етиопия, като нисък, а вероятността от внос и вторична трансмисия в ЕС/ЕИП – като много ниска. Джинка е туристически център за региона, но остава относително отдалечен от Адис Абеба.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГлобалната трансмисия на холера продължава да се поддържа на повишени нива, с 577 843 случая и 7 395 смъртни изхода, съобщени от 1 януари 2025 г. насам – увеличение с 17% на случаите в сравнение със същия период на 2024 г. В последния отчетен период (29 октомври – 25 ноември) са регистрирани 15 394 нови случая и 194 смъртни изхода, като най-голям принос имат Афганистан (10 781 случая), Ангола (2 493), Судан (1 117), Бурунди (567) и Етиопия (413).\nСудан представлява най-сериозен проблем по отношение на смъртността, с 114 съобщени смъртни случая за този период – 59% от всички смъртни случаи от холера в света, което отразява комбинирания ефект от въоръжени конфликти, разселване на населението и колапс на здравната система. Южният Судан съобщава 78 034 кумулативни случая на холера през 2025 г. в сравнение само със 114 през същия период на 2024 г., което представлява катастрофален скок. В Ангола и Чад се наблюдава продължаваща трансмисия, а огнища персистират в множество региони в Азия (Афганистан, Мианмар, Непал) и Източна Африка (Бурунди, Етиопия, Кения, Мозамбик).\nРискът от инфекция с холера за пътуващи от ЕС/ЕИП остава нисък, макар че спорадичен внос е възможен. Ваксинацията следва да се разглежда като опция за служители в спешни и хуманитарни мисии, командировани в засегнатите региони.\n\n\n\nОгнището на Ебола в провинция Касаи, ДР Конго, изглежда е в затихваща фаза, като 42-дневният период за обявяване на официален край на огнището започна на 19 октомври 2025 г. след изписването на последния пациент. От момента на обявяване на огнището на 4 септември са регистрирани общо 64 случая (53 потвърдени и 11 вероятни) и 45 смъртни изхода (коефициент на леталитет 70,3%), всички от здравния район Булапе. Не са съобщени нови случаи след 26 септември и няма контактни лица под активно наблюдение. Общо 44 453 души са ваксинирани. Това е шестнадесетото огнище на Ебола в ДР Конго от 1976 г. насам и осмото от 2018 г. насам.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГрипният сезон 2025–2026 г. е започнал с 3–4 седмици по-рано в сравнение с предходните две години, като повече от половината страни от ЕС/ЕИП вече съобщават за активност над базовото ниво. Грип A доминира циркулацията (99% от типираните проби), като подкладецът A(H3N2) 2a.3a.1(K) представлява 85% от генетично охарактеризираните A(H3) проби и движи текущата нарастваща тенденция. Най-високи нива на циркулация се наблюдават при децата на възраст 5–14 години, докато ранното увеличение на хоспитализациите се концентрира предимно сред възрастните над 65 години.\nПрез седмица 48, чрез първичния доболничен сентинелен надзор са открити 256 грипни проби със съвкупна позитивност 16% (медиана 4,6%; IQR 2,9–8,3%), докато чрез болничния надзор на тежки остри респираторни инфекции (SARI) са установени 139 грипни проби с 14% съвкупна позитивност. Осем страни съобщават за базово ниво на активност, осем – за ниска интензивност и две – за средна интензивност. Географското разпространение варира от спорадично (5 страни) до широко (5 страни).\nECDC публикува Съкратена оценка на заплахата на 20 ноември 2025 г., оценяваща риска, свързан с увеличаващата се циркулация на подкладеца A(H3N2) K. Активността на респираторния синцитиален вирус (RSV) се увеличава бавно от ниски нива – приблизително с една седмица по-късно в сравнение с предходния сезон – и засяга предимно деца под 5-годишна възраст. SARS-CoV-2 продължава да циркулира, но активността намалява във всички възрастови групи.\n\n\n\nКоклюшната епидемия от 2024 г., която обхвана Европа, значително е затихнала. Макар това да не се отразява директно в седмица 48 в съвкупните данни за ЕС/ЕИП, българският надзор ясно илюстрира динамиката: случаите за 2025 г. до момента (88) представляват намаление с 96,8% в сравнение с 2024 г. (2 709). Този модел вероятно отразява сходни тенденции в други държави – членки на ЕС/ЕИП, където коклюшът рязко се е увеличил през 2024 г. след пандемичните нарушения в програмите за детска ваксинация.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nПродължаващото огнище на хепатит A, засягащо Австрия, Чехия, Унгария и Словакия, вече е надхвърлило 6 000 кумулативни случая през 2025 г. с 39 смъртни изхода, което го превръща в едно от най-големите огнища на HAV в историята на ЕС/ЕИП. Секвенирането установява два близкородствени клъстера на HAV подгенотип IB, различаващи се само по една нуклеотидна замяна. Клъстер А включва случаи от Австрия, Германия, Унгария и Швеция, а Клъстер B – случаи от Австрия, Чехия, Словакия, Швеция и Обединеното кралство.\nВирусът на хепатит A се предава лесно по фекално-орален път, с инкубационен период средно около 4 седмици (диапазон 2–6 седмици). Вирусът демонстрира забележителна устойчивост в околната среда, като издържа на кисела среда и замразяване. При децата инфекцията често протича леко или асимптомно, докато при възрастни – особено при лица с подлежащи чернодробни заболявания или злоупотреба с алкохол – може да протече като тежък остър хепатит с потенциал за фулминантна чернодробна недостатъчност.\nЕпидемиологичният профил се различава значително по държави: в Чехия са съобщени 2 310 случая и 27 смъртни изхода, като 16% от случаите са свързани с идентифицирани огнища, а 17% – с рискови фактори като венозна употреба на наркотици (178 случая), бездомност (188) или лишаване от свобода (27). Словакия съобщава 2 482 случая с продължаваща трансмисия сред ромски общности и хора, живеещи при лоши санитарни условия. В Унгария са съобщени 1 548 случая с най-високи нива на заболяемост сред деца на 3–9 години и в североизточните окръзи. Австрия регистрира 216 случая със значително представяне на хора, живеещи в бездомност, и хора, употребяващи наркотици, като Виена е епицентър на огнището.\nНе е идентифициран хранителен източник; човек-на-човек трансмисията сред групи с ограничен достъп до адекватни санитарни условия остава основният двигател на огнището. ECDC оценява риска като умерен до висок за засегнатите групи и нисък до умерен за общото население с достъп до санитарни и здравни услуги. В засегнатите страни се провеждат целенасочени ваксинационни кампании, но наличността на ваксини остава предизвикателство.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЛокалната трансмисия на вируса Чикунгуня продължава във Франция и Италия през сезон 2025 г., като към 26 ноември са съобщени съответно 795 и 385 местно придобити случая. Франция съобщава за 15 нови местно придобити случая през седмица 48, разпределени в 79 клъстера, от които 9 са все още активни. Италия не съобщава нови случаи през тази седмица.\nВирусът Чикунгуня се предава основно чрез комари Aedes albopictus в Европа. Заболяването протича с остро начало на висока температура и силна артралгия, обикновено 4–7 дни след експозиция. Макар смъртността да е ниска, инвалидизиращите ставни болки могат да персистират месеци до години, особено при възрастни хора. Персистирането на активни клъстери въпреки настъпващи неблагоприятни за векторите сезонни условия подсказва потенциал за късносезонна трансмисия и изисква бдителност за забавени диагнози в следващите седмици.\n\n\n\nЧетиринадесет държави съобщават за човешки случаи на инфекция с вируса на Западен Нил през 2025 г., включително България (сред страните от ЕС/ЕИП са още: Хърватия, Франция, Германия, Гърция, Унгария, Италия, Румъния, Испания) и съседни държави (Албания, Косово, Северна Македония, Сърбия, Турция). Идентифицирани са общо 157 засегнати географски района. Векторният сезон е към своя край, но забавеното докладване на случаи може да продължи още няколко седмици."

    "text": "Потвърждаването на първата в света човешка инфекция с птичи грип A(H5N5) представлява сигнално събитие в надзора на зоонозните грипни вируси. Пациентът – възрастен човек със съпътстващи заболявания от окръг Грейс Харбър, щата Вашингтон – развива симптоми през 43-та седмица, е хоспитализиран през 45-та седмица и умира на 21 ноември 2025 г. Екологични проби от двора на пациента, където се отглеждат домашни птици, дават положителни резултати за птичи грип, което установява като най-вероятен източник на експозиция домашни птици, които са били в контакт с диви птици.\nВисокопатогенните вируси на птичи грип A(H5) причиняват тежко системно заболяване при птиците с леталитет, достигащ почти 100%, а човешките инфекции, макар и редки, могат да доведат до тежко респираторно заболяване с висок коефициент на леталитет. Инкубационният период обикновено варира между 2 и 8 дни. Най-висок риск от инфекция имат лица, които имат директен контакт със заразени птици, техните секрети или контаминирани повърхности в околната среда.\nСеквенираният изолат (A/Washington/2148/2025) принадлежи към клада 2.3.4.4b, генотип A6, която е установена при птици и бозайници в Северна Америка и е означена като EA-2021-I при европейските изолати. Критично важно е, че не са идентифицирани мутации, асоциирани с адаптация към бозайници, и не е установено предаване от човек на човек сред контактните лица на пациента. Този генетичен профил е в съответствие с щамовете, циркулиращи при диви птици в Северна Европа през текущата епидемиологична година, където седем страни от ЕС/ЕИП съобщават за детекции. Допълнително A(H5N5) е идентифициран и при диви бозайници, включително арктическа лисица, рис и американска норка в Исландия и Норвегия от началото на 2024 г.\nCDC на САЩ оценява риска за общото население като нисък, и тази оценка се пренася и за населението на ЕС/ЕИП. Въпреки това глобалната значимост на този първи човешки случай с A(H5N5) налага засилен надзор, особено за лица с професионална или рекреационна експозиция на домашни птици и диви птици.\n\n\n\nНа 24 ноември 2025 г. СЗО потвърждава втори глобален човешки случай на инфекция с птичи грип A(H5N2), регистриран при млада жена без съпътстващи заболявания в Мексико Сити. Пациентката е била експонирана на птици и куче, което дава положителен резултат за A(H5) в района, където живее. За разлика от първия човешки случай, съобщен през април 2024 г. (причинен от нископатогенен птичи грип), настоящият щам демонстрира високопатогенен профил в сегмента на хемаглутинина, но не носи мутации, известни като повишаващи зоонозния потенциал. Не е установено предаване от човек на човек, а рискът за населението на ЕС/ЕИП остава нисък."

    "text": "Етиопия преживява първото си в историята огнище на болест, причинена от вируса Марбург, потвърдено на 14 ноември 2025 г. след установяване на подозрителни случаи в град Джинка в региона на Южните нации, националности и народи. Към 27 ноември са съобщени 15 случая (12 лабораторно потвърдени и 3 вероятни) и 11 смъртни изхода, което съответства на коефициент на леталитет 66,7%.\nВирусът Марбург причинява тежка хеморагична треска с исторически регистрирани коефициенти на леталитет до 88% при някои огнища. Вирусът се предава чрез директен контакт с кръвта и други телесни течности на заразени хора или животни, като инкубационният период обичайно е 5–10 дни (диапазон 3–21 дни). Плодоядните прилепи от семейство Pteropodidae служат като естествен резервоар. Клиничната картина се характеризира с внезапно начало на фебрилитет, силно главоболие, мускулни болки и изразена умора, последвани от гастроинтестинални симптоми, а в по-късните стадии – от необясними кръвоизливи. Медицинските специалисти са изложени на особено висок професионален риск, като вече са съобщени два смъртни изхода сред здравни работници.\nТревожен аспект на текущото огнище е географското разширяване към град Хаваса в регион Сидама след завръщане на пътувал от Джинка, което показва потенциал за по-широка дисеминация. При проследяване на контактните лица са идентифицирани 349 души, като 119 от тях вече са завършили 21-дневния период на наблюдение. Цялогеномното секвениране установява сходство с по-рано идентифицирани източноафрикански щамове.

    "text": "Въздушно-капкови\n\nCOVID-19\nВ България са регистрирани 69 случая на COVID-19 през седмица 48, което представлява намаление с 40,5% спрямо предходната седмица (116 случая) и продължава низходящата тенденция, наблюдавана през есента на 2025 г. Случаите от началото на годината (2 959) са с 80,3% по-малко в сравнение с 2024 г. (15 052), което отразява прехода към ендемичен модел на циркулация и намалена интензивност на тестване. Най-много случаи са съобщени в София-град (13), следвана от Бургас (10) и Варна (4). Всички случаи са лабораторно потвърдени.\n\n\nКоклюш (магарешка кашлица)\nПрез седмица 48 са потвърдени три случая на коклюш, увеличение с два случая спрямо предходната седмица. Случаите са съобщени от Пловдив (1), София-град (1) и Стара Загора (1). Случаите от началото на годината са общо 88 в сравнение с 2 709 за същия период на 2024 г., което представлява спад от 96,8% и отразява отшумяването на епидемичната вълна от 2024 г.\nКоклюшът, причинен от Bordetella pertussis, се предава по въздушно-капков път, с инкубационен период 7–10 дни. Класическата клинична картина включва пароксизмална кашлица, инспираторен „магарешки“ шум и повръщане след пристъпи на кашлица, макар че проявите значително варират според възрастта и ваксиналния статус. Кърмачетата, които са твърде малки, за да бъдат обхванати от имунизация, са с най-висок риск от усложнения, включително пневмония, гърчове, енцефалопатия и смърт. Европейската епидемия от 2024 г. подчерта значението на поддържането на високо ваксинално покритие и прилагането на стратегии за имунизация на бременни.\n\n\nЛегионерска болест\nПрез седмица 48 са потвърдени два случая на легионерска болест, което представлява удвояване спрямо предходната седмица. Случаите от началото на годината (15) надвишават тези за 2024 г. (10) с 50%, което налага засилен екологичен надзор върху водните системи.\nLegionella pneumophila, причинителят на заболяването, колонизира изкуствени водни системи и се предава чрез инхалиране на аерозоли, съдържащи бактерията, от източници като охладителни кули, системи за топла вода и спа басейни. Заболяването протича като тежка пневмония с инкубационен период 2–10 дни, като най-засегнати са възрастни хора, имунокомпрометирани лица и пациенти с хронични белодробни заболявания. Леталитетът може да надхвърли 10% при отсъствие на своевременно и адекватно антибиотично лечение."

От тях 40 са лабораторно потвърдени, 1 – вероятен, и 3 – възможни случаи. Географското разпределение показва случаи в множество региони, включително Пловдив (40), София-град (4), Хасково (7) и Шумен (7), наред с други.\nВъпреки седмичното намаление, случаите от началото на годината (1 447) са със 123% повече в сравнение с 2024 г. (648). Този съществен ръст е в съзвучие с по-широкото европейско огнище на хепатит A, засягащо съседни страни, макар че специфичният принос на отделните типове хепатит в България изисква допълнителна характеристика. С оглед на продължаващото многострано огнище на HAV, засягащо население в Централна Европа с ограничен достъп до санитарни условия, са необходими засилен надзор и целенасочени превантивни мерки."

Случаите са географски разпръснати в множество региони, включително София-град (5), Пловдив (1) и Плевен (4). От началото на годината са съобщени 661 случая, което е с 25,7% по-малко в сравнение с 2024 г. (890), въпреки че седмичното нарастване изисква внимание за потенциално клъстериране на случаи.\nСалмонелозата, най-често причинявана от нетифоидни серовари на Salmonella, се предава чрез контаминирани хранителни продукти, особено птиче месо, яйца и непастьоризирани млечни продукти. Инкубационният период е 6–72 часа, а клиничната картина варира от самоограничаващ се гастроентерит до инвазивно заболяване при уязвими групи. Антимикробната резистентност сред изолатите на Salmonella остава ключов приоритет за общественото здраве и надзора.\n\nКампилобактериоза\nДеветнадесет случая на кампилобактериоза са потвърдени през седмица 48, което представлява увеличение с 3 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Най-много случаи са регистрирани в София-град (9), следвана от Варна (5). Важно е да се отбележи, че случаите от началото на годината (456) надвишават тези за 2024 г. (316) с 44,3%, което представлява устойчиво нарастване през 2025 г. и налага оценка на потенциалните източници и рискови фактори.\nВидовете Campylobacter, предимно C. jejuni и C. coli, са водеща бактериална причина за гастроентерит в индустриализираните страни. Заразяването става най-често чрез консумация на недостатъчно термично обработено птиче месо, непастьоризирано мляко и контаминирана вода, с инкубационен период 1–10 дни. Постинфекциозни усложнения като синдром на Гилен–Баре и реактивен артрит възникват при малък процент от случаите.\n\n\nРотавирусни гастроентерити\nДесет случая на ротавирусен гастроентерит са потвърдени през седмица 48, което представлява намаление с 3 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Случаите са разпределени в София-град (4), Плевен (2) и няколко други региона. Случаите от началото на годината (691) са с 12,4% по-малко в сравнение с 2024 г. (789), което вероятно отразява продължаващата полза от програмите за детска ваксинация срещу ротавирус."

Случаите от началото на годината (342) представляват увеличение с 11,4% в сравнение с 2024 г. (307). Особено обезпокоително е, че случаите на вроден сифилис достигат 34 от началото на годината в сравнение с 14 през 2024 г. – ръст от 143%, което сигнализира за потенциални пропуски в програмите за скрининг и лечение по време на бременност.\nГонорея – регистрирани са 5 потвърдени случая през седмица 48, увеличение с 3 случая спрямо предходната седмица.

(258).\nПоследователните възходящи трендове във всички категории ППИ предполагат влияние на системни фактори, включително възможно намаляване на обхвата на профилактичните услуги, промени в сексуалното поведение или подобрено откриване и докладване. Драматичното увеличение на случаите на вроден сифилис – от 14 на 34 от началото на годината – е особено спешен проблем за общественото здраве, изискващ незабавно внимание към качеството и обхвата на пренаталните грижи."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Global and EU Perspective\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\nMeasles surveillance across Europe during September 2025 demonstrated an expected seasonal decrease, with 90 cases reported by 11 countries while 17 countries reported zero cases. However, the 12-month period from October 2024 through September 2025 saw 10,195 measles cases across 30 EU/EEA Member States, with 71.3% laboratory confirmed. The age distribution reveals vulnerability across the lifespan, with 40.5% of cases occurring in children under five years and 32.5% in individuals aged 15 years or above. Infants under one year experienced the highest notification rate at 336.4 cases per million population, followed by children aged one to four years at 174.6 per million. The overwhelming majority of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals, who represented 81.1% of cases, while those with two or more vaccine doses comprised only 7% of cases. Eight deaths were reported during this period, with Romania accounting for five, France for two, and the Netherlands for one, yielding a case fatality rate of 0.074%.\nRecent epidemic intelligence surveillance conducted on 13 and 14 November revealed an active outbreak in the Canary Islands with 21 cases across La Palma, Gran Canaria, and Tenerife. The outbreak, which began on 20 October with three cases including two children and a healthcare worker, has expanded to include seven new cases this week, five adults in La Palma and two cases in Gran Canaria. Epidemiological investigation traced the index case to contact with a case previously detected in Tenerife. The recent cases present with mild disease and are recovering without complications, though authorities continue active contact tracing. Spain overall reported 379 cases as of 9 November, representing an increase of 35 cases since 30 September, with 108 imported cases and 92 related to imported cases.\nBeyond Europe, Canada has lost its measles elimination status according to notification from the Pan American Health Organization, due to an ongoing multi-jurisdictional outbreak lasting more than 12 months. As of 10 November, Canada reported 5,162 cases including two deaths in congenitally infected pre-term infants. The United States reported 1,723 confirmed cases with three deaths across 43 jurisdictions, with 92% occurring in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Mexico’s situation remains severe with 5,257 confirmed cases and 23 deaths through week 43, predominantly concentrated in Chihuahua state with 4,440 confirmed cases and 21 deaths. Africa reported 129,680 cases with 1,110 deaths across 20 countries, yielding a case fatality rate of 0.79%.\nInfluenza surveillance indicates an earlier start to the 2025-2026 season compared to the previous two years, with circulation increasing three to four weeks ahead of typical patterns. During week 45, primary care surveillance detected 167 influenza cases, with the overwhelming predominance of influenza A accounting for 98.2% of detections. Among subtyped influenza A viruses, A(H3) represented 68% while A(H1)pdm09 comprised 32%, marking a shift in the dominant circulating subtype. Children aged five to fourteen years show the highest number of detections, consistent with typical epidemiological patterns. Genetic characterization of 83 viruses from weeks 40 through 45 revealed that A(H1)pdm09 viruses predominantly belonged to clade 5a.2a.1(D.3.1) representing 97% of characterized strains, while A(H3) viruses showed 86% belonging to clade 2a.3a.1(K). Despite increasing influenza activity, the impact on hospitalizations remains limited at this time, with 52 influenza detections in severe acute respiratory infection surveillance during week 45.\nSARS-CoV-2 indicators demonstrate stable or decreasing trends across Europe, with 155 detections in primary care and 23 in hospital settings during week 45. Variant surveillance for weeks 43-44 showed continued dominance of the XFG variant accounting for 78% of detections across five countries, classified as a variant under monitoring. The NB.1.8.1 variant represented 8% of detections, while BA.2.86, classified as a variant of interest, accounted for 4%. The current levels of COVID-19 circulation remain substantially below those observed in autumn 2024, consistent with the transition to endemic patterns.\nRespiratory syncytial virus circulation has increased in recent weeks but remains at low levels, with 17 detections in primary care and 21 in hospital settings during week 45. The cumulative data from weeks 40 through 45 shows 97 primary care detections and 111 hospital detections. RSV detections occur primarily in children under five years of age, and the temporal trends follow similar patterns to the previous season, suggesting a typical seasonal onset. Both RSV-A and RSV-B are circulating, with RSV-A representing between 33% and 75% of typed detections depending on surveillance setting.\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\nWest Nile virus transmission across Europe is concluding for the 2025 season, with the latest case onset date of 27 October reported among the cumulative 1,096 locally acquired human infections. Italy experienced the most intense circulation with 773 cases including 71 deaths, representing a case fatality rate of 9.2% within the expected range but marking the highest number of human infections Italy has reported at this time of year. The Lazio region served as the primary epicenter with 265 cases concentrated in Latina, Roma, and Frosinone provinces, while the Campania region reported 133 cases distributed across Napoli, Caserta, Salerno, and Avellino provinces. Other regions in Italy reported numbers similar to previous years, suggesting that the outbreak expansion primarily affected central regions.\nThe 2025 season introduced West Nile virus to 35 regions reporting human cases for the first time, including 17 Italian regions spanning from northern provinces like Genova and Sondrio to southern areas such as Reggio di Calabria and multiple Sicilian provinces. France reported first-time detections in 14 regions, notably including the Paris metropolitan area with cases in Paris proper and six surrounding departments, suggesting urban transmission. This urban detection pattern represents a significant epidemiological development, as West Nile virus has historically been associated with rural and wetland areas. Germany, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Kosovo, Romania, and Türkiye each reported first-time detections in one to three regions.\nFrom the veterinary perspective, 178 outbreaks among equids and 345 outbreaks among birds have been reported across Europe in 2025. The temporal distribution showed outbreak activity from mid-January through late October, with the earliest equid outbreak starting 15 January in Germany and the earliest bird outbreak beginning 16 February in Italy. Italy dominated both animal surveillance categories, accounting for 86 of 178 equid outbreaks and 318 of 345 bird outbreaks, reflecting intensive surveillance capacity alongside favorable ecological conditions for virus circulation. Belgium reported West Nile virus for the first time with three bird outbreaks in August 2025 involving Eurasian jackdaws and carrion crows in the Mechelen and Halle-Vilvoorde administrative units. The Netherlands also reported its first equid outbreak to the Animal Disease Information System in October 2025, though the virus had been previously detected in mosquitoes, birds, and humans since 2020.\nBird species surveillance identified carrion crows as associated with the highest number of outbreaks at 95, followed by common magpies with 59 outbreaks and common wood-pigeons with 30 outbreaks. These corvid species serve as particularly sensitive sentinels for West Nile virus circulation due to their high susceptibility and the visibility of mortality events. As temperatures decline across Europe and mosquito activity diminishes, only sporadic human cases are expected in the coming weeks, with the 2025 transmission season effectively concluded.\nDengue surveillance globally documented over 4.5 million cases and more than 3,000 deaths from 103 countries and territories since the beginning of 2025. The Americas region reported 3.9 million cases through week 40, representing a 68% decrease compared to the same period in 2024 but remaining 9% above the five-year average. Cases peaked during weeks 12-14 of 2025 before entering a declining trend. All four dengue virus serotypes continue to circulate with varying geographic distributions across countries. Brazil maintains the highest burden with cases reported across all regions, though a declining trend from June through October suggests seasonal contraction. Cuba’s outbreak affects all 14 provinces with decreasing febrile syndrome cases suggesting disease control measures are achieving impact.\nIn Asia, dengue case numbers reached 136,233 representing a 31.5% decrease compared to the same period in 2024, with Southeast Asia bearing the greatest burden. Bangladesh demonstrates continuing increasing trends since August, with 6,235 new cases reported during the week of 27 October through 2 November, and cumulative 2025 figures exceeding those from the same period in 2024. Vietnam shows an increasing trend with 122,979 cases and 23 deaths as of 17 October. China reported 5,280 cases through the end of September, lower than the same period in 2024, though the monthly number of cases increased from 1,702 in August to 2,321 in September. The Guangdong province continues as the primary affected area. Singapore’s outbreak, which began in early August with initial cases associated with travelers returning from Guangdong, has continued through September and October.\nWithin the EU/EEA, seasonal dengue surveillance recorded 29 autochthonous cases in France and four in Italy as of 5 November. This week saw no new cases reported to ECDC, and all clusters are currently closed. The outermost regions demonstrate varying transmission patterns. Guadeloupe continues epidemic phase 2 level 1 with isolated outbreaks and DENV-3 as the predominant serotype. Martinique, Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy maintain epidemic phase 1 with sporadic cases at lower levels. French Guiana confirmed nine dengue cases in weeks 43-44, bringing the year-to-date total to 293 cases with 97% of serotyped samples identified as DENV-2. Mayotte has reported 30 cases through 8 September with no recent detections. Réunion’s 44 cases year-to-date include 17 confirmed, with the last autochthonous case identified in week 17 at the end of April.\nChikungunya surveillance globally documented 458,840 cases and 146 deaths from 24 countries and territories in 2025. October saw 44,295 new cases representing a 108% increase from September’s 21,266 cases, though with only one associated death compared to ten in September. The Americas region accounts for 266,165 cases and 118 deaths, showing a 35.2% decrease compared to the same period in 2024. Brazil maintains transmission across all regions with recent epidemiological weeks showing highest numbers in Centro-Oeste and Sudeste regions, particularly in Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo federal units. Cuba’s outbreak affects all 14 provinces with decreasing febrile syndrome trends suggesting epidemic control. Bolivia reported cases in six of nine departments with Santa Cruz accounting for over 80% of cases and all deaths, including documented cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with chikungunya infection.\nIn Asia, the 136,233 cases with no associated deaths represent a 31.5% decrease compared to the same period in 2024, with Southeast Asia most affected. China’s outbreak, continuing since the first case in July 2025, shows concentration in Guangdong province, particularly Jiangmen, Foshan, and Guangzhou cities. Weekly case numbers demonstrate a decreasing trend during epidemiological weeks 41-43, though October’s total increased compared to September. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangxi province have also reported cases, initially associated with imported cases from Guangdong. Pakistan’s year-round transmission concentrated in southwestern provinces shows 109 cases over the last 60 days with no deaths, representing a 37% increase in October compared to September. Singapore’s cases reported since early August include initial outbreak cases associated with travelers returning from Guangdong, with continued transmission through September and October.\nFor the EU/EEA, seasonal chikungunya surveillance documented 776 cases in France and 384 in Italy as of 12 November. This week France did not report surveillance data, with reporting expected in week 47. Italy reported ten new locally acquired cases, bringing the cumulative total to 384 cases distributed across six clusters, with three clusters currently active. The largest cluster is located in Carpi, San Prospero, Soliera, Novellara, Cavezzo, Modena, Nonantola, Correggio, Novi di Modena, and Cesenatico in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\nThe most significant global development in week 46 concerns poliomyelitis, with Germany reporting detection of wild poliovirus type 1 in a wastewater sample from Hamburg. The sample, collected during calendar week 41 as part of a research project to establish poliovirus detection methodology, represents the first such finding in a country that has maintained polio-free status as part of the WHO European Region since 2002. Genome sequencing revealed strong similarity to a genetic cluster circulating in Afghanistan, where wild poliovirus type 1 continues to circulate alongside Pakistan. No clinical cases of poliomyelitis have been reported in Germany, and the Robert Koch Institute emphasizes that the risk to the general population remains very low due to high vaccination coverage of approximately 88% for three doses of inactivated polio vaccine.\nThis detection, while unusual, was not unexpected given the continuing global circulation of wild poliovirus and the presence of under-vaccinated populations within European countries. The virus spreads primarily through the fecal-oral route, with infected individuals shedding virus in their feces for several weeks even when asymptomatic, making wastewater surveillance a sensitive early warning system. The majority of poliovirus infections produce no visible symptoms, approximately 24% cause minor non-specific illness, and fewer than 1% progress to paralytic poliomyelitis with its characteristic acute flaccid paralysis. The German authorities have assessed that while the risk to the general population is very low, the occurrence of a clinical case in unvaccinated individuals cannot be completely ruled out. This finding follows previous detections of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in German wastewater since late 2024, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and robust environmental surveillance.\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\nMpox surveillance revealed significant developments in transmission patterns during week 46, with 88 new cases reported from eight EU/EEA countries since 9 October. Spain led with 29 cases, followed by Germany with 19, Portugal with 16, France with 12, Netherlands with nine, and Greece, Hungary, and Norway with one case each. The cumulative burden since the outbreak began has reached 25,609 confirmed cases across 29 EU/EEA countries, with Spain accounting for 9,110 cases, France 4,552, and Germany 4,540. Ten deaths have been reported from five countries during the entire outbreak period.\nThe emergence of mpox clade I in Europe continues with 50 total cases reported as of 13 November, including 46 cases submitted to The European Surveillance System and four additional cases from Spain reported through event-based surveillance. Germany has reported 15 clade I cases, while Belgium and the Netherlands each reported seven cases. The distribution includes Spain with six cases, Ireland and Italy with four cases each, France with four cases, and Portugal, Greece, and Sweden with one case each. All cases involve clade Ib except the first Irish case, which was caused by clade Ia.\nThe most significant epidemiological development concerns the identification of 14 clade Ib mpox cases among men who have sex with men, with 12 cases lacking any travel links to countries with known mpox clade Ib transmission. The Netherlands reported seven cases among men who have sex with men, Spain reported five cases, Belgium one, and Greece one. The cases in Belgium and Greece were imported, but the remaining cases in Spain and the Netherlands occurred in individuals without travel history. Geographic distribution shows cases in Madrid and Barcelona for Spain, while the Netherlands cases are distributed across the country. All cases among men who have sex with men except the Greek case had symptom onset in October 2025, indicating very recent transmission events.\nThese findings demonstrate ongoing local transmission of mpox clade I within sexual networks of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in the EU/EEA, representing a significant shift from the earlier outbreak phase when all clade I cases were either imported or directly related to imported cases with heterosexual and household transmission patterns. Notably, none of the clade I mpox cases reported among men who have sex with men required hospitalization, and three cases occurred in vaccinated individuals, though vaccine effectiveness data for clade I remain limited. Seven individuals overall have been hospitalized for treatment during the clade I outbreak, all from the earlier heterosexual and household transmission phase.\nThe epidemiological pattern suggests that mpox clade I has established transmission chains within European sexual networks independent of travel-related importation. This development prompted ECDC to publish a Threat Assessment Brief on 24 October, assessing the risk of MPXV clade Ib infection as moderate for men who have sex with men and low for the general population in the EU/EEA. The moderate risk assessment for men who have sex with men reflects the documented local transmission, while considerable uncertainties remain regarding the transmissibility and severity of clade Ib relative to clade IIb, which has been circulating in Europe since 2022.\nConfirmed secondary transmission events from imported clade I cases have been reported by Germany, Belgium, and Ireland among household or other close contacts, demonstrating that the virus maintains transmission capability beyond sexual networks when close contact occurs. The presence of both sexual network transmission and household transmission underscores the need for comprehensive public health responses addressing multiple risk groups and transmission contexts."

    "section": "Infectious Diseases: Bulgaria",
    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Bulgaria\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\nBulgaria’s surveillance during week 46 documented significant increases in vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases consistent with autumn seasonal patterns. Varicella reported 420 cases, representing an increase of 83 cases from the previous week, a 24.6% rise that reflects the characteristic autumn-winter seasonality of this highly contagious virus. The case distribution included 45 possible, 305 probable, and 70 confirmed cases, with the highest numbers in Varna with 63 cases, and Sofia-oblast and Sofia-grad each reporting 60 cases. The year-to-date total of 18,538 cases represents a 20.3% decrease compared to the 23,271 cases during the same period in 2024, suggesting that the current season follows a more moderate trajectory than the previous year. Varicella predominantly affects children, and the characteristic vesicular rash that appears in successive crops creates the typical clinical picture. While generally a mild disease in healthy children, varicella can cause severe complications in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and adults who escaped childhood infection.\nScarlet fever demonstrated substantial increase with 84 cases during week 46, rising by 34 cases from the previous week. The case distribution included 20 possible, 33 probable, and 31 confirmed cases, with Plovdiv reporting the highest number at 26 cases. The year-to-date total of 3,060 cases represents a dramatic 60.7% decrease compared to the 7,793 cases during the same period in 2024, continuing a declining trend that has characterized the entire year. Scarlet fever results from Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis with production of erythrogenic toxin, causing the characteristic sandpaper-like rash, strawberry tongue, and circumoral pallor. The disease primarily affects children aged five to fifteen years, and while usually mild with appropriate antibiotic treatment, can lead to serious complications including acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis if untreated.\nPertussis surveillance recorded one confirmed case during week 46, bringing the year-to-date total to 84 cases, representing a 96.9% decrease compared to the 2,678 cases during the same period in 2024. This dramatic decline likely reflects the cyclical nature of pertussis epidemics, which typically occur every three to five years, with 2024 representing a peak year across much of Europe. Pertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, produces characteristic paroxysmal coughing with inspiratory whoop in classic presentations, though the disease spectrum varies by age with adolescents and adults often presenting with prolonged cough without typical features. The disease poses greatest risk to infants too young for complete vaccination, in whom severe complications including apnea, pneumonia, seizures, and encephalopathy can occur.\nOne case of measles was reported from the Pernik region during week 46. As discussed in the European section above, measles remains a concern across the continent despite high vaccination coverage in most areas, with outbreaks occurring when the virus is introduced into communities with immunity gaps. The highly contagious nature of measles, with basic reproduction numbers of 12-18 in susceptible populations, means that vaccination coverage must exceed 95% to prevent community transmission. The isolated case reported in Bulgaria emphasizes the importance of rapid response including contact tracing, vaccination verification, and targeted vaccination campaigns in affected communities.\nBacterial meningitis and meningoencephalitis surveillance recorded one case in Plovdiv region during week 46. The surveillance system captures meningitis caused by various bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and other bacteria. The clinical presentation typically includes fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness, progressing rapidly over hours to days. Immediate empiric antibiotic therapy is essential given the high mortality and morbidity associated with delayed treatment. The relatively low case count reflects the success of conjugate vaccine programs targeting the most common bacterial causes of meningitis in children and adults.\nCOVID-19 surveillance documented 121 confirmed cases during week 46, representing a decrease of 41 cases from the previous week, a 25.3% reduction that suggests declining transmission. The geographic distribution showed Sofia-oblast reporting the highest number with 29 cases, followed by Plovdiv with 11 cases and Varna with four cases. The year-to-date total of 2,774 cases represents an 81.2% decrease compared to the 14,776 cases during the same period in 2024, reflecting the transition to endemic circulation patterns with substantially lower disease burden than during the pandemic years. The stable mortality suggests that population immunity from vaccination and prior infection, combined with less virulent circulating variants, has reduced disease severity at the population level.\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\nLyme borreliosis reported five confirmed cases during week 46, with stable numbers compared to the previous week. Cases were distributed across Gabrovo, Lovech, Stara Zagora, and Pleven regions, reflecting the widespread geographic distribution of tick vectors throughout Bulgaria. The year-to-date total of 368 cases represents a slight increase of four cases compared to 364 during the same period in 2024, suggesting stable endemic transmission. Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex transmitted by Ixodes tick species, typically presents with early localized disease characterized by the pathognomonic erythema migrans rash, a slowly expanding red patch with central clearing. If untreated, infection can progress to early disseminated disease with multiple erythema migrans lesions, neurological manifestations including facial palsy and meningitis, or cardiac involvement. Late disease manifests as arthritis, typically affecting large joints, or chronic neurological symptoms. The disease responds well to antibiotic therapy when recognized early, emphasizing the importance of clinical awareness and prompt diagnosis.\nLegionnaires’ disease surveillance recorded one confirmed case during week 46, representing an increase of one case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 12 cases shows an increase of two cases compared to the ten cases during the same period in 2024. Legionnaires’ disease results from inhalation of aerosols containing Legionella pneumophila bacteria, typically from contaminated water systems including cooling towers, hot tubs, decorative fountains, and plumbing systems. The disease presents as severe pneumonia with high fever, cough, and systemic symptoms, requiring specific antibiotic therapy. Environmental investigation of potential sources is essential for each case to prevent additional exposures and identify systems requiring remediation.\nQ fever reported one confirmed case during week 46 in Sofia-oblast, representing an increase of one case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 37 cases shows a decrease of six cases compared to 43 during the same period in 2024. Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a zoonotic disease with cattle, sheep, and goats serving as primary reservoirs. Transmission typically occurs through inhalation of aerosols from contaminated environments, particularly during birthing of infected animals when organisms are shed in high concentrations in placental tissues and birth fluids. Occupational exposure represents the primary risk factor, with farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers at elevated risk. Acute Q fever presents as a febrile illness that may include pneumonia or hepatitis, while chronic Q fever manifests as endocarditis or vascular infections, particularly in individuals with pre-existing valvular disease or vascular abnormalities.\n\n\nGastrointestinal and Fecal-Oral Transmission\nGastroenteritis and enterocolitis surveillance documented 147 cases during week 46, representing a decrease of 18 cases from the previous week. The case distribution included 47 possible, 96 probable, and four confirmed cases, with Plovdiv reporting 32 cases, Varna 22 cases, and Pleven ten cases. The year-to-date total of 8,506 cases represents a 5.9% decrease compared to 9,038 cases during the same period in 2024. This broad surveillance category captures gastroenteritis of multiple etiologies including viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes. The predominance of probable cases reflects the syndromic nature of surveillance, where clinical presentations suggest gastroenteritis but specific pathogen identification is not always performed. The autumn-winter increase in cases reflects seasonal patterns associated with increased norovirus transmission in colder months and increased rotavirus circulation.\nRotavirus gastroenteritis reported 19 cases during week 46, representing an increase of 11 cases from the previous week. The case distribution included one probable and 18 confirmed cases, demonstrating the high proportion of laboratory-confirmed diagnoses for this pathogen. The year-to-date total of 668 cases shows a slight decrease of 39 cases compared to 707 during the same period in 2024. Rotavirus remains the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children under five years of age globally despite vaccine availability. The virus causes profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, with dehydration representing the primary complication requiring medical intervention. The seasonal increase during autumn and winter months reflects optimal transmission conditions and increased person-to-person contact in indoor environments.\nSalmonellosis recorded four confirmed cases during week 46, representing a decrease of two cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 622 cases shows a 28.8% decrease compared to 874 cases during the same period in 2024. Salmonella bacteria cause gastroenteritis through consumption of contaminated food, particularly poultry, eggs, and unpasteurized dairy products, though a wide variety of foods can serve as vehicles. The infection typically causes diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps beginning 12 to 72 hours after exposure, with illness duration of four to seven days in most cases. While most individuals recover without specific treatment, invasive disease can occur, particularly in young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised persons.\nDysentery, specifically shigellosis, reported two confirmed cases during week 46 in Dobrich and Kyustendil regions, representing an increase of one case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 53 cases shows a decrease of 22 cases compared to 75 during the same period in 2024. Shigella bacteria cause dysentery characterized by diarrhea containing blood and mucus, abdominal cramps, fever, and tenesmus. The infection spreads through the fecal-oral route with a very low infectious dose, meaning that person-to-person transmission occurs readily, particularly in settings with inadequate hand hygiene. Shigellosis represents an important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and outbreaks in institutional settings.\nCampylobacteriosis documented 14 confirmed cases during week 46, representing an increase of five cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 421 cases shows a substantial 43.7% increase compared to 293 cases during the same period in 2024. Sofia-oblast reported the majority of cases with ten. Campylobacter bacteria, particularly Campylobacter jejuni, represent the most common bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in many developed countries. Infection typically results from consumption of undercooked poultry or cross-contamination from raw poultry to other foods, as well as consumption of unpasteurized milk. The illness produces diarrhea that may be bloody, fever, and abdominal pain, typically lasting less than one week. Post-infectious complications including reactive arthritis and, rarely, Guillain-Barré syndrome can occur.\nEscherichia coli infections causing colitis, specifically escherichiosis, reported four confirmed cases during week 46, representing a decrease of four cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 287 cases compares to 328 during the same period in 2024. Various pathotypes of E. coli cause gastrointestinal disease through different mechanisms, including enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, enteroaggregative, and enterohemorrhagic strains. The clinical presentations range from watery diarrhea to bloody diarrhea depending on the pathotype involved. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, particularly serotype O157:H7, causes particular concern due to the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a severe complication causing acute kidney injury.\n\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSyphilis surveillance documented 14 cases during week 46, representing an increase of nine cases from the previous week. The case distribution included one probable and 13 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 323 cases shows a 9.9% increase compared to 294 cases during the same period in 2024. Syphilis, caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, produces complex clinical manifestations progressing through distinct stages if untreated. Primary syphilis presents with a painless chancre at the inoculation site, while secondary syphilis causes systemic symptoms including rash, lymphadenopathy, and mucocutaneous lesions. Latent syphilis produces no symptoms despite persistent infection, and tertiary syphilis can affect multiple organ systems including cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The disease responds well to penicillin therapy, and screening programs targeting sexually active individuals enable early detection and treatment.\nCongenital and infant syphilis reported one confirmed case during week 46, representing an increase of one case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 34 cases shows a concerning 183% increase compared to 12 cases during the same period in 2024. Congenital syphilis results from transplacental transmission of Treponema pallidum from an infected mother to the fetus, with transmission risk highest during primary and secondary maternal infection but possible during latent infection. Congenital syphilis can cause fetal death, stillbirth, prematurity, and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in surviving infants including skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and neurosyphilis. The substantial increase in congenital syphilis cases indicates failures in the prenatal care system, as universal screening during pregnancy combined with prompt treatment of infected women prevents congenital transmission. This finding warrants urgent public health investigation to identify gaps in prenatal screening, obstacles to accessing care, or failures in partner treatment that perpetuate maternal infection.\nUrogenital chlamydia infection reported two confirmed cases during week 46, representing a decrease of four cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 169 cases shows a 79.8% increase compared to 94 cases during the same period in 2024. Chlamydia trachomatis causes the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection globally, though most infections produce no symptoms, particularly in women. When symptomatic, infection causes urethritis in men and cervicitis in women, with complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility in women, and epididymitis in men. The asymptomatic nature of most infections emphasizes the importance of screening programs targeting sexually active young adults to enable detection and treatment before complications develop.\nGonorrhea documented two confirmed cases during week 46, stable compared to the previous week. The year-to-date total of 107 cases shows a 28.9% increase compared to 83 cases during the same period in 2024. Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes urethritis in men and cervicitis in women, though like chlamydia, many infections produce no symptoms, particularly in women. Complications include pelvic inflammatory disease in women and epididymitis in men, and disseminated gonococcal infection can cause arthritis and dermatitis. The increasing global prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea represents a major public health concern, with resistance documented to penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides, and emerging resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins.\nHIV surveillance reported five confirmed cases during week 46, representing a decrease of three cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 272 cases shows a 9.7% increase compared to 248 cases during the same period in 2024. HIV infection progresses through stages from acute infection with high viral loads, through chronic infection where viral replication continues but at lower levels, to advanced HIV disease characterized by severe immunodeficiency enabling opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV from a rapidly fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, with early treatment initiation enabling life expectancies approaching those of uninfected individuals. Treatment also prevents transmission, as individuals with suppressed viral loads on effective antiretroviral therapy do not transmit the virus sexually. The continued new infections emphasize the importance of prevention programs including pre-exposure prophylaxis for individuals at substantial risk, post-exposure prophylaxis after potential exposures, and comprehensive sexual health services.\n\n\nViral Hepatitis\nAcute viral hepatitis ABCDEN reported 39 cases during week 46, representing a decrease of three cases from the previous week. The case distribution included four possible, nine probable, and 26 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 1,317 cases shows a substantial 112.8% increase compared to 619 cases during the same period in 2024. This dramatic increase warrants careful epidemiological investigation to characterize the etiologies involved, identify transmission patterns, and implement targeted control measures. The surveillance category encompasses hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, which differ substantially in transmission routes, natural history, and prevention strategies. Hepatitis A and E transmit through the fecal-oral route, hepatitis B and C transmit through blood and sexual contact, and hepatitis D requires co-infection with hepatitis B. The doubling of cases suggests either increased transmission of one or more hepatitis viruses or changes in healthcare-seeking behavior or testing practices that increase case detection."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWeek 46 of 2025 illustrates both the progress achieved in infectious disease control and the persistent challenges requiring sustained public health attention. The detection of wild poliovirus in Germany despite decades of polio-free status demonstrates that as long as pathogens circulate anywhere in the world, reintroduction risk persists everywhere. The emergence of mpox clade I transmission in European sexual networks shows how pathogens can establish new transmission patterns in susceptible populations, requiring adaptive public health responses. Bulgaria’s surveillance reveals expected seasonal patterns for respiratory infections alongside concerning increases in sexually transmitted infections and viral hepatitis that warrant investigation and intervention."

    "text": "As of October 31, 2025, the European epidemiological landscape for SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with sustained circulation of multiple viral lineages. The variant classification system maintained by ECDC recognizes no current variants of concern, but continues to monitor one variant of interest and two variants under monitoring that collectively account for the majority of sequenced infections across reporting countries.\nThe VOI and VUM median proportions in the EU/EEA for weeks 41-42, based on five reporting countries, demonstrate the following distribution: BA.2.86 classified as a variant of interest represents 4.4% of sequences (range: 0.0-14%; interquartile range 2.9-7.3%); NB.1.8.1 classified as a variant under monitoring accounts for 10.5% (range: 2.3-30.0%; IQR: 4.6-12.9%); and XFG, also a variant under monitoring, predominates at 85% (range: 60.0-86.5%; IQR: 82.2-86.2%).\nThe EU/EEA population overall has accumulated significant hybrid immunity through combinations of prior infection and vaccination, conferring substantial protection against severe disease. Current circulating variants classified as VOI or VUM appear unlikely to be associated with increases in infection severity compared with previously circulating variants, or with significant reductions in vaccine effectiveness against severe disease. However, certain populations remain at elevated risk for severe outcomes: older adults aged 65 years and above, individuals with underlying medical conditions that compromise immune function or cardiorespiratory capacity, and persons who have not been previously infected may still develop serious symptoms requiring hospitalization if infected.\n\n\n\nThe Ebola virus disease outbreak in Kasai Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, which began in early September 2025, has entered a critical phase approaching declaration of outbreak termination. On October 19, 2025, the World Health Organization announced that the last Ebola patient had been discharged from treatment, initiating the 42-day countdown period for declaring the outbreak over. This countdown period represents twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus disease and allows public health authorities to ensure no additional transmission chains remain undetected in the community.\nAs of November 6, 2025, no new cases have been reported since September 26, and all 1,735 of 1,787 contacts (97.3%) identified through contact tracing have completed their follow-up period with no individuals remaining under active monitoring. If no new cases are detected, the outbreak will be officially declared over in early December 2025, marking the resolution of what became the sixteenth documented Ebola outbreak in DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976.\nSince the outbreak declaration on September 4, 2025, there have been 64 total cases (53 confirmed through laboratory testing and 11 probable based on clinical and epidemiological criteria) and 45 deaths (34 among confirmed cases and 11 among probable cases), yielding an overall case fatality rate of 70.3%. All cases were reported from six health areas within Bulape health zone, with geographic clustering suggesting the outbreak originated from a single zoonotic spillover event followed by human-to-human transmission chains.\nThe outbreak response has been comprehensive, incorporating multiple interventions including rapid case detection and isolation, meticulous contact tracing, ring vaccination using the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (with 37,178 people vaccinated as of November 6), and treatment of patients with monoclonal antibody therapy (31 patients received mAb114). The geographic concentration of cases in a single health zone, combined with aggressive public health interventions, appears to have successfully interrupted transmission chains before wider geographic spread could occur.\n\n\n\nThe global cholera situation in 2025 continues to reflect significant disease burden across multiple continents, with substantial case numbers and mortality reported from endemic regions and areas experiencing humanitarian crises. Since January 1, 2025, and as of October 29, 2025, a total of 562,449 cholera cases including 7,201 deaths have been reported worldwide, representing a concerning increase compared to the 462,096 cases and 3,434 deaths reported during the equivalent period in 2024.\nSince May 2, 2025, and as of October 29, 2025, there have been 450,783 new cholera cases including 5,642 new deaths reported globally. The five countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases during this period are Afghanistan (123,416 cases), Yemen (74,452 cases), Sudan (62,315 cases), South Sudan (53,602 cases), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (46,832 cases). These countries collectively account for the majority of global cholera burden and share common characteristics including ongoing armed conflict, displacement of populations, disruption of water and sanitation infrastructure, and challenges in healthcare access.\nThe five countries reporting the most new deaths are Sudan (1,749 deaths), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,507 deaths), South Sudan (862 deaths), Nigeria (468 deaths), and Angola (344 deaths). The disproportionate mortality in these settings reflects both the large case numbers and challenges in providing timely rehydration therapy, which is the cornerstone of cholera case management. In settings with functioning health systems and adequate supplies of oral and intravenous rehydration solutions, cholera case fatality rates can be reduced to less than 1%, but in complex humanitarian emergencies with limited healthcare infrastructure, case fatality rates often exceed 2-5%.\nIn 2025, cholera cases have been reported from countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas, demonstrating the continued global distribution of this disease. The concentration of cases in countries experiencing armed conflict, population displacement, and water infrastructure disruption highlights the complex intersection of infectious disease transmission, humanitarian emergencies, and climate phenomena. Many of the most severely affected countries have experienced flooding events that contaminate water supplies while simultaneously displacing populations into crowded settings with inadequate sanitation.\n\n\n\nDengue surveillance in Europe during week 45 shows that locally acquired transmission has essentially concluded for the 2025 season. Since the beginning of 2025, and as of November 5, 2025,three countries in Europe have reported autochthonous dengue cases: France (29 cases), Italy (four cases), and Portugal (two cases). During week 45 specifically, no new cases of dengue were reported to ECDC, and all previously identified clusters have been closed, suggesting that declining temperatures and reduced mosquito activity have effectively terminated local transmission for this season.\nThe presence of autochthonous dengue transmission in three European countries represents a significant epidemiological development, as historically dengue in Europe was exclusively associated with travel-related importation from endemic regions in tropical and subtropical areas. The establishment of local transmission demonstrates that all necessary components for sustained arboviral transmission have aligned in certain European locales: populations of competent mosquito vectors (primarily Aedes albopictus), suitable climatic conditions for viral replication and transmission during warm months, and sufficient numbers of susceptible hosts.\n\n\n\nAn emerging outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Western Africa represents a significant public health development requiring enhanced surveillance and response efforts. Since September 21, 2025, Senegal has reported 397 human cases including 29 deaths (case fatality rate: 7.3%). The eight affected regions are Saint-Louis (304 cases), Louga (18), Matam (27), Fatick (18), Dakar (9), Kaolack (14), Thiès (2), Tambacounda (3), and Kèdougou (2). Most cases have occurred in males, with the most affected age group being individuals 15-35 years old. Animal surveillance has identified 160 cases among livestock with no deaths but 640 animal abortions, and 11,644 animals have been vaccinated.\nSince September 27, 2025, Mauritania has reported 46 human cases including 14 deaths (case fatality rate: 30.4%). The 13 affected regions are concentrated in the south near the Senegal border, three of which share international borders: Assaba (bordering Mali), Brakna, and Trarza (both bordering Senegal along the Senegal River). Animal surveillance has documented 235 confirmed cases and 71 deaths among livestock since September 15.\nOn November 5, 2025, media sources citing health officials reported the first human case of Rift Valley fever in Gambia, in the Senegalese border village of Ker Ayib. Animal surveillance on October 28 identified four cases in livestock in Gambia. The cases in all three countries are primarily located around the Senegal River delta and valley, and early autumn months are considered a high-risk period for RVF in the region.\nGenomic analysis suggests that the current outbreak in Senegal is linked to previous detections in Senegal (Fatick in 2020 and Matam in 2022) and in Mauritania (2020), indicating that the virus has been circulating in the region with periodic emergence into epidemic transmission. All three countries have reported outbreaks among livestock animals, which serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, with all human infections resulting from direct or indirect contact with infected animal tissues or fluids, or from bites by infected mosquito vectors."

    "text": "As of October 31, 2025, the European epidemiological landscape for SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with sustained circulation of multiple viral lineages. The variant classification system maintained by ECDC recognizes no current variants of concern, but continues to monitor one variant of interest and two variants under monitoring that collectively account for the majority of sequenced infections across reporting countries.\nThe VOI and VUM median proportions in the EU/EEA for weeks 41-42, based on five reporting countries, demonstrate the following distribution: BA.2.86 classified as a variant of interest represents 4.4% of sequences (range: 0.0-14%; interquartile range 2.9-7.3%); NB.1.8.1 classified as a variant under monitoring accounts for 10.5% (range: 2.3-30.0%; IQR: 4.6-12.9%); and XFG, also a variant under monitoring, predominates at 85% (range: 60.0-86.5%; IQR: 82.2-86.2%).\nThe EU/EEA population overall has accumulated significant hybrid immunity through combinations of prior infection and vaccination, conferring substantial protection against severe disease. Current circulating variants classified as VOI or VUM appear unlikely to be associated with increases in infection severity compared with previously circulating variants, or with significant reductions in vaccine effectiveness against severe disease. However, certain populations remain at elevated risk for severe outcomes: older adults aged 65 years and above, individuals with underlying medical conditions that compromise immune function or cardiorespiratory capacity, and persons who have not been previously infected may still develop serious symptoms requiring hospitalization if infected.\n\n\n\nThe Ebola virus disease outbreak in Kasai Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, which began in early September 2025, has entered a critical phase approaching declaration of outbreak termination. On October 19, 2025, the World Health Organization announced that the last Ebola patient had been discharged from treatment, initiating the 42-day countdown period for declaring the outbreak over. This countdown period represents twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus disease and allows public health authorities to ensure no additional transmission chains remain undetected in the community.\nAs of November 6, 2025, no new cases have been reported since September 26, and all 1,735 of 1,787 contacts (97.3%) identified through contact tracing have completed their follow-up period with no individuals remaining under active monitoring. If no new cases are detected, the outbreak will be officially declared over in early December 2025, marking the resolution of what became the sixteenth documented Ebola outbreak in DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976.\nSince the outbreak declaration on September 4, 2025, there have been 64 total cases (53 confirmed through laboratory testing and 11 probable based on clinical and epidemiological criteria) and 45 deaths (34 among confirmed cases and 11 among probable cases), yielding an overall case fatality rate of 70.3%.

    "section": "Europe: Regional Infectious Disease Surveillance",
    "text": "Europe: Regional Infectious Disease Surveillance\n\nMedical Products and Disease Updates\nDuring week 45, the European Medicines Agency continued its regulatory activities to ensure safe and effective therapeutic options across both human and veterinary medicine sectors. While no new opinions for human medicinal products were publicly reported during this specific week, ongoing pharmacovigilance activities and post-marketing surveillance continued for previously authorized medicines. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use was notably active, adopting several important opinions that will enhance disease prevention and control capabilities in animal populations, which indirectly supports public health through reduction of zoonotic disease risks and protection of food-producing animals.\n\n\nVeterinary Pharmaceutical Developments and Regulatory Actions\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use concluded its meeting for week 45 of 2025 with several significant regulatory decisions that will impact veterinary medical practice across Europe. The committee adopted positive opinions for multiple new products and variations to existing products that address important veterinary health needs.\nThe committee adopted a positive opinion, in exceptional circumstances, for a marketing authorization for Vaxxinact H5, an avian influenza vaccine utilizing subunit recombinant technology. This vaccine is intended for prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza serotype 5, including the currently circulating clade 2.3.4.4b. The specific indications include: active immunization to prevent mortality, clinical signs, and to reduce viral excretion in chickens and mulard ducks; to reduce mortality, clinical signs and viral excretion in muscovy ducks and turkeys; and to reduce viral excretion in pekin ducks. This approval represents an important tool for controlling avian influenza in poultry operations, as highly pathogenic avian influenza continues to cause periodic outbreaks with significant economic impact and zoonotic potential.\nThe committee adopted a positive opinion for a marketing authorization for Ecovaxxin MS, a Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine for active immunization of future layer and future breeder chickens from 4 weeks of age. This vaccine is indicated to reduce air sac lesions, foot pad lesions (synovitis), ovarian regressions, and egg production losses caused by Mycoplasma synoviae infections. Mycoplasma synoviae is an important poultry pathogen that causes significant economic losses through reduced egg production and condemnation of affected carcasses.\nThe committee adopted a positive opinion for a variation for Frontpro (afoxolaner) concerning changes to therapeutic indications, including: addition of treatment of tick infestation with Hyalomma marginatum, reduction of the risk of infection with Dipylidium caninum via transmission by Ctenocephalides felis (cat flee) for 30 days, and reduction of the risk of infection with Babesia canis canis via transmission by Dermacentor reticulatus for 28 days. These expanded indications reflect growing recognition of the importance of ectoparasite control not only for comfort and dermatological health but also for prevention of vector-borne pathogen transmission.\nThe committee adopted a positive opinion for a variation following a work-sharing procedure for Credelio (lotilaner), Lotimax (lotilaner), and Credelio Plus (lotilaner/milbemycin oxime) concerning changes to therapeutic indications in dogs. The expanded indications include treatment of sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis) and reduction of the risk of infection with Babesia canis canis via transmission by Dermacentor reticulatus for one month.\nThe committee also adopted positive opinions for variations to several other products including Mhyosphere PCV ID (introducing manufacturing changes and upgrading ‘Elevated body temperature’ from common to very common adverse events), Librela (bedinvetmab) (implementing signal management outcomes to include additional adverse events and extending shelf-life from 2 to 3 years), and multiple quality-related manufacturing changes for other veterinary medicinal products.\n\n\nRespiratory Virus Epidemiology: Early Winter Season Developments\nRespiratory virus surveillance across the EU/EEA during week 45 demonstrates expected early winter season patterns with gradually increasing activity for multiple respiratory pathogens. The number of patients visiting primary care with symptoms of respiratory illness remains at low overall levels but has begun increasing in most countries, consistent with typical seasonal patterns for this time of year. Similar increases have not yet been observed in patients admitted to hospital with respiratory illness, suggesting that current community transmission has not yet translated into severe disease requiring hospitalization at elevated levels.\nInfluenza circulation remains at low levels overall but is beginning to increase in some countries, following typical seasonal patterns. Respiratory syncytial virus circulation similarly remains low but shows early signs of increasing activity. SARS-CoV-2 circulation continues to be widespread but is decreasing overall, following a trend similar to patterns observed at this time during the previous season. The co-circulation of these three major respiratory viruses at varying levels of activity requires continued vigilance, as simultaneous high-level circulation could stress healthcare systems during winter months.\nIn terms of virological surveillance in primary care settings during week 44, 105 influenza detections were made, with influenza A accounting for 103 cases (99%), predominantly split between A(H1N1)pdm09 (36 cases, 41%) and A(H3) (51 cases, 59%), with 16 influenza A cases not subtyped. Only one influenza B detection was reported. RSV detections totaled 18 cases, with RSV-B (6 cases, 67%) being more common than RSV-A (3 cases, 33%), and 9 RSV detections not typed. SARS-CoV-2 detections totaled 123 cases.\nFor the cumulative period from week 40 to week 44, there were 397 influenza detections (377 influenza A accounting for 98% and 8 influenza B), 68 RSV detections, and 1,322 SARS-CoV-2 detections from primary care sentinel surveillance. In hospital SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) surveillance during week 44, there were 53 influenza detections (all influenza A), 20 RSV detections, and 62 SARS-CoV-2 detections.\nThe age distribution of RSV cases shows primary impact in children aged below five years, while influenza circulation is primarily observed in children aged below 15 years. This age-specific pattern is consistent with typical seasonal respiratory virus epidemiology, with RSV particularly affecting infants and young children who lack prior immunity, while influenza affects broader pediatric age groups.\n\n\nChikungunya Virus Disease: Continued Autochthonous Transmission\nAutochthonous transmission of chikungunya continues to be documented in Southern Europe, marking an important epidemiological development for this arboviral disease. Since the beginning of 2025, and as of November 5, 2025, two countries have reported locally acquired cases: France (776 cases across 77 clusters, with 18 clusters currently active) and Italy (374 cases across six clusters, with three clusters currently active).\nDuring week 45 specifically, France reported eight new locally acquired cases and Italy reported four new cases. In the previous week (week 44), France had reported 13 new cases and Italy had reported one new case. The largest active cluster in France is located in Antibes, while Italy’s largest cluster encompasses multiple municipalities: Carpi, San Prospero, Soliera, Novellara, Cavezzo, Modena, Nonantola, Correggio, Novi di Modena, and Cesenatico.\nThe sustained transmission of chikungunya, a disease traditionally associated with tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean islands, signals the expanding geographic range of competent vectors and the adaptation of arboviral transmission to European climatic conditions. The primary vector responsible for European transmission is Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. This highly adaptive mosquito species has successfully colonized much of Southern Europe over the past two decades, taking advantage of international trade and travel to establish populations far from its native Southeast Asian range.\nUnlike Culex mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus, Aedes albopictus feeds during daytime hours, with peak biting activity during early morning and late afternoon hours. The chikungunya virus is transmitted directly from human to mosquito to human, without requiring avian or animal reservoir hosts. When a mosquito bites an infected person during the viremic phase of illness, typically during the first week of symptoms, it may acquire the virus and subsequently transmit it to other humans. This direct human-to-human transmission cycle via mosquito vectors allows for rapid amplification of cases in areas with high densities of competent mosquitoes and susceptible human populations.\nThe disease manifests with sudden onset of high fever and severe joint pain, often so debilitating that patients have difficulty walking. The name “chikungunya” derives from a Kimakonde word meaning “to become contorted,” referring to the stooped posture of patients suffering from severe arthralgia. While rarely fatal, the joint pain can persist for months or even years in some patients, causing significant morbidity and reduced quality of life.\nThe establishment of autochthonous transmission in France and Italy represents a sentinel event in European infectious disease epidemiology. Previously, chikungunya cases in Europe were exclusively travel-associated, with patients having acquired infection during visits to endemic areas. The documentation of local transmission indicates that all three necessary components for sustained arboviral disease have aligned: competent vector populations, suitable climatic conditions for viral replication and transmission, and sufficient numbers of susceptible hosts.\n\n\nWest Nile Virus: End-of-Season European Surveillance\nDuring week 45, transmission activity appears to be declining consistent with seasonal expectations, though final case counts for the week were not specified in the surveillance summary. The extended transmission season, with cases continuing to be documented into early November, likely reflects warmer autumn temperatures that prolong mosquito survival and activity beyond historical seasonal patterns, combined with changes in precipitation patterns that create more persistent breeding sites."

    "section": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends",
    "text": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends\n\nProposed Health Legislation Under Public Consultation\nDuring week 45, the Ministry of Health released several significant regulatory proposals for public consultation, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen Bulgaria’s healthcare infrastructure and disease surveillance systems.\nMedical Standard for Forensic Medicine and Deontology\nA comprehensive draft regulation establishing medical standards for forensic medicine practice was released for public consultation from November 7 to December 8, 2025. This regulation defines forensic medicine as an interdisciplinary specialty that develops theoretically and applies practically medical knowledge and methods specific to forensic medicine, as well as those from all medical specialties, in order to answer questions arising in the process of justice administration and deontological questions in medicine.\nThe standard establishes requirements for facilities conducting forensic medical activities across three levels: specialized outpatient care, secondary-level hospital structures, and tertiary-level facilities offering advanced capabilities including DNA analysis (profiling), chemical/toxicological investigations, forensic medical imaging diagnostics, entomological investigations, and forensic anthropological investigations. The regulation specifies minimum requirements for equipment, personnel, and quality standards for forensic medical examinations of living persons, document reviews, autopsy procedures, and specialized laboratory investigations.\nAmendments to Immunization Regulation\nA draft regulation amending the Immunization Regulation No. 15 from 2005 was released for public consultation from November 7 to December 8, 2025. The proposed amendments introduce several significant changes to Bulgaria’s mandatory immunization schedule:\nAddition of varicella (chickenpox) to mandatory childhood immunizations, with one dose at 12-15 months of age and a second dose at 4 years of age. This addition addresses varicella as a common childhood illness that, while typically mild, can cause serious complications in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and occasionally in healthy adults.\nIntroduction of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunization for pregnant women during gestational weeks 24-36. This represents an important advance in maternal immunization strategies, as RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for respiratory illness in infants, and maternal antibodies transferred during late pregnancy can provide protection to newborns during their most vulnerable first months of life.\nModifications to the pertussis (whooping cough) immunization schedule for children born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy, with immunization starting at 2 months of age rather than 6 weeks. This adjustment recognizes that infants of vaccinated mothers may have maternal antibodies that alter optimal vaccine timing.\nUpdates to pneumococcal vaccine schedules for children of vaccinated mothers, with immunization beginning at 2 months of age. The regulation specifies that subsequent immunizations should occur no earlier than 8 weeks after the first dose.\nAmendments to Water Quality Regulation\nA draft regulation amending Water Quality Regulation No. 9 from 2001 was released for consultation. The proposed changes aim to strengthen requirements for protecting drinking water sources and align Bulgarian legislation with EU directives on water quality. Amendments include enhanced protection requirements for water catchment areas, updated monitoring requirements, and provisions for addressing emerging contaminants.\nAmendment to Regulation on Classification Systems for Diseases and Medical Procedures\nA proposal to amend Regulation No. 42 from 2004 on introducing classification statistical systems for coding diseases, health-related problems, and medical procedures was released for consultation from November 7 to December 8, 2025. The amendments aim to update the scope of approved disease codes according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), reflecting normative changes and ensuring that Bulgaria’s disease classification system remains current with international standards.\nMedical Standard for Child Psychiatry\nA draft regulation establishing a medical standard for child psychiatry was released for consultation from November 5 to December 5, 2025. This represents the first standalone standard specifically for child psychiatry as an independent medical specialty, as previous relevant provisions were contained within the general psychiatry standard but were insufficient for the specific clinical needs of pediatric psychiatric practice. Bulgaria currently has approximately 33 physicians with recognized specialty in child psychiatry, with the majority (about 16) working in Sofia and the remainder distributed across other major regional cities including Varna, Burgas, Plovdiv, Pleven, Ruse, Targovishte, Razlog, Kyustendil, and Lovech.\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Surveillance: Week 45 Detailed Analysis\nThe National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases reported comprehensive surveillance data for week 45, covering November 3-9, 2025. The surveillance system captured data across multiple disease categories, reflecting Bulgaria’s ongoing commitment to comprehensive infectious disease monitoring.\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\nDuring week 45, Bulgaria registered 337 cases of varicella, representing an increase of 25 cases from the previous week. By case classification, 38 cases were classified as possible, 255 as probable, and 44 as confirmed. Since the beginning of 2025, a total of 18,118 varicella cases have been registered nationally, representing a decrease of 4,710 cases compared to the 22,828 cases documented during the equivalent period in 2024. This substantial year-over-year decrease reflects the cyclical nature of varicella epidemiology, with the disease exhibiting multi-year patterns of higher and lower transmission intensity.\nThe proposed addition of varicella vaccine to Bulgaria’s mandatory immunization schedule, currently under public consultation, would significantly alter the epidemiological landscape of this common childhood disease. Varicella, while typically self-limiting in healthy children, can cause serious complications including bacterial superinfection of skin lesions, pneumonia, cerebellar ataxia, and encephalitis. The disease poses particular risks to immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and occasionally to healthy adults who may develop more severe manifestations than children.\nGastrointestinal and Foodborne Infections\nGastrointestinal infections represented a substantial portion of infectious disease surveillance during week 45. A total of 165 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis were registered, representing a decrease of 13 cases from the previous week. Case classification showed 60 possible cases, 99 probable cases, and 6 confirmed cases. Since the beginning of 2025, Bulgaria has registered 8,359 such cases, representing a decrease of 509 cases compared to the 8,868 cases documented during 2024.\nSalmonellosis showed lower activity during week 45, with 6 confirmed cases reported, representing a decrease of 9 cases from the previous week. All reported cases were confirmed through laboratory testing. The cumulative total from the beginning of the year reached 618 cases, representing a substantial decrease of 247 cases compared to the 865 cases reported during the equivalent period in 2024. Salmonellosis typically results from consumption of contaminated poultry products, eggs, or vegetables, with symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps developing 12 to 72 hours after exposure.\nCampylobacteriosis demonstrated sustained activity with 9 confirmed cases reported during week 45, representing a decrease of 5 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 407 cases represents a notable increase of 120 cases compared to the 287 cases documented during 2024. Campylobacter species, particularly Campylobacter jejuni, represent the most common bacterial cause of gastroenteritis globally and are typically acquired through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, or contaminated water.\nOne case of yersiniosis was confirmed during week 45, increasing by 1 case from the previous week. The annual total of 14 cases represents a decrease of 3 cases compared to 17 cases in 2024. Yersiniosis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica typically manifests as acute diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain that may mimic appendicitis, particularly in children.\nEight cases of E. coli enteritis were confirmed during week 45, increasing by 3 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 283 cases represents a decrease of 32 cases compared to 315 cases in 2024. No cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC/VTEC) were reported, though surveillance for these potentially severe infections continues.\nRotaviral gastroenteritis, which predominantly affects pediatric populations, showed 8 confirmed cases during week 45, representing a decrease of 3 cases from the previous week. The annual total of 649 cases remains relatively stable compared to 675 cases in 2024. Rotavirus remains a leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in young children despite vaccine availability, with transmission occurring through the fecal-oral route in settings where young children congregate.\nOne case of dysentery (shigellosis) was confirmed during week 45, increasing by 1 case from the previous week. The cumulative total of 51 cases represents a decrease of 23 cases compared to 74 cases in 2024. Shigellosis typically causes severe dysentery with bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, and is highly transmissible in settings with inadequate sanitation.\nScarlet Fever and Streptococcal Infections\nScarlet fever activity continued during week 45 with 50 reported cases (18 possible, 20 probable, and 12 confirmed), representing a decrease of 3 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 2,976 cases represents a substantial decrease of 4,743 cases compared to the 7,719 cases documented during 2024. Scarlet fever is caused by group A streptococci producing erythrogenic toxins and manifests with fever, pharyngitis, and a characteristic sandpaper-like rash. The decline may reflect natural cyclical variations in streptococcal disease activity or changes in diagnostic practices.\nTick-Borne Diseases\nLyme borreliosis continued to be documented, with 5 confirmed cases reported during week 45, representing a decrease of 2 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 363 cases represents a modest increase of 4 cases compared to 359 cases during 2024. This stable endemic transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato through Ixodes tick vectors is expected given Bulgaria’s geographic and climatic characteristics. Lyme disease typically manifests initially with the characteristic erythema migrans rash at the site of tick attachment, potentially followed by disseminated infection affecting the nervous system, heart, or joints if untreated.\nRespiratory Infections and Invasive Bacterial Diseases\nCOVID-19 surveillance continued in Bulgaria, with 162 confirmed cases reported during week 45, representing a decrease of 66 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 2,653 cases reflects a dramatic decrease of 11,938 cases compared to the 14,591 cases documented during the equivalent period in 2024. This decline aligns with global trends showing decreasing COVID-19 incidence as population immunity from vaccination and prior infection accumulates.\nOne case of pertussis (whooping cough) was confirmed during week 45, increasing by 1 case from the previous week. The annual total of 83 cases represents a dramatic decrease of 2,589 cases from the 2,672 cases during 2024, likely reflecting the cyclical nature of pertussis epidemiology, with epidemic peaks occurring every three to five years followed by inter-epidemic periods of low transmission.\nOne case of meningococcal infection was confirmed during week 45, increasing by 1 case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 14 cases represents an increase of 8 cases from the 6 cases during 2024, requiring continued vigilance for this potentially rapidly fatal infection.\nOne case of listeriosis was confirmed during week 45, increasing by 1 case from the previous week. The annual total of 5 cases represents a decrease of 7 cases from the 12 cases during 2024. Listeriosis, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised persons, and can cause severe illness including meningitis and septicemia.\nFour cases of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis were reported during week 45 (2 probable and 2 confirmed), increasing by 4 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 80 cases represents an increase of 5 cases compared to 75 cases during 2024.\nNo cases of legionnaires’ disease were reported during week 45, following one case the previous week. The annual total of 11 cases represents a slight increase from 10 cases during 2024. Legionnaires’ disease results from inhalation of water aerosols contaminated with Legionella pneumophila and manifests as severe pneumonia that can be fatal without appropriate antibiotic therapy.\nViral Hepatitis\nAcute viral hepatitis demonstrated elevated activity during week 45, with 42 reported cases (5 possible, 3 probable, and 34 confirmed), representing a decrease of 2 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 1,278 cases represents a substantial increase of 678 cases compared to the 600 cases documented during 2024. This significant increase requires detailed investigation to determine whether it reflects heightened transmission of specific hepatitis viruses, changes in diagnostic practices with increased testing, or reporting artifacts.\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSexually transmitted infections continue to represent an important public health concern in Bulgaria, with ongoing transmission of multiple pathogens documented through surveillance systems. During week 45, 8 confirmed HIV infections were reported, representing a decrease of 2 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 267 cases represents an increase of 24 cases compared to the 243 cases during 2024. This upward trend in HIV diagnoses may reflect increased transmission, improved case detection through expanded testing initiatives, or delayed diagnoses of infections acquired in previous years.\nSyphilis surveillance documented 5 confirmed cases during week 45, representing a decrease of 1 case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 309 cases compares to 289 cases during 2024. Of particular concern is the documentation of 33 cases of congenital syphilis during 2025, a dramatic increase from the 12 cases during 2024. Congenital syphilis results from maternal-fetal transmission during pregnancy and can cause severe fetal and neonatal complications including stillbirth, neonatal death, and serious long-term sequelae among survivors. The substantial increase in congenital syphilis cases suggests gaps in prenatal screening and treatment programs that require urgent public health attention.\nUrogenital chlamydial infection showed 6 confirmed cases during week 45, representing a decrease of 1 case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 167 cases represents a substantial increase from the 94 cases during 2024. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can cause cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease if untreated, with potential complications including ectopic pregnancy and infertility.\nGonorrhea surveillance documented 2 confirmed cases during week 45, representing a decrease of 1 case from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 105 cases compares to 83 cases during 2024. The increasing trend in gonorrhea cases parallels global patterns and raises concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which has developed resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics historically used for treatment."

    "section": "Pharmaceutical Advances and Regulatory Actions",
    "text": "Pharmaceutical Advances and Regulatory Actions\nThe European Medicines Agency concluded its October 2025 meeting with several significant regulatory decisions that will impact clinical practice across Europe and potentially influence global therapeutic approaches to chronic diseases. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended approval for two novel therapeutic agents addressing previously inadequately treated conditions, while declining authorization for one product under consideration for chronic graft-versus-host disease.\nBrinsupri, containing the active substance brensocatib, received a positive opinion as the first authorized treatment specifically for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. This chronic pulmonary condition affects thousands of patients across Europe and is characterized by permanent dilation and damage to the bronchial airways, resulting from recurrent infections, inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance. Patients with bronchiectasis experience chronic productive cough, recurrent pulmonary infections, progressive decline in lung function, and significantly impaired quality of life. The disease typically follows a progressive course with alternating periods of clinical stability and acute exacerbations requiring antimicrobial therapy and sometimes hospitalization. Brensocatib represents a mechanism-based approach targeting neutrophil serine proteases, which play a central role in the inflammatory cascade driving bronchiectasis progression. The availability of this treatment addresses a significant unmet medical need, as previous management strategies relied primarily on symptomatic treatment with bronchodilators, mucolytics, and antibiotics without disease-modifying therapies.\nWayrilz, with the active substance rilzabrutinib, received positive recommendation for treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in adult patients who have proven refractory to other therapeutic interventions. Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated platelet destruction and inadequate platelet production, resulting in thrombocytopenia that places patients at risk for spontaneous bleeding, including potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The condition significantly impacts patients’ daily activities, as those with severe thrombocytopenia must restrict physical activity to avoid trauma and may experience fatigue, petechiae, purpura, and mucosal bleeding. Rilzabrutinib functions as a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting B-cell and macrophage function involved in antiplatelet antibody production and platelet destruction. For patients who have failed conventional therapies including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and splenectomy, this novel mechanism provides an important therapeutic alternative.\nThe Committee declined to recommend authorization for Rezurock, containing belumosudil, for treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. This decision reflects the rigorous evaluation process employed by European regulatory authorities to ensure that benefits clearly outweigh risks before medications receive marketing authorization. Chronic graft-versus-host disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the decision underscores the continuing need for effective therapies for this condition.\nBeyond these specific approvals, the EMA Committee issued positive opinions for extensions of therapeutic indications for eight existing medicines, expanding the clinical scenarios in which these established treatments may be employed. These indication extensions typically reflect accumulated clinical experience, completed clinical trials demonstrating efficacy in new patient populations, or recognition of therapeutic utility in related conditions."

    "text": "West Nile Virus: Continental Perspective and Transmission Dynamics\nAs of October 3, 2025, the European surveillance network has recorded 989 confirmed WNV cases across 13 member countries, marking a significant year for West Nile virus activity in the region. Italy leads with 714 cases and 48 fatalities, representing the most substantial outbreak in Europe. The primary affected regions include Lazio and Campania, where ecological conditions favor sustained mosquito breeding and bird populations that maintain the viral reservoir. The case fatality rate highlights the severity of infections in vulnerable populations, particularly elderly individuals and those with underlying immunosuppressive conditions. Greece, Serbia, and other Balkan nations continue to report active transmission, with the temporal pattern showing that cases began on June 2, 2025, peaked around late September, and continue under active monitoring into November.\nThe geographic distribution demonstrates the persistent establishment of WNV transmission cycles across Southern and Southeastern Europe, with mosquito vectors maintaining activity later into the season than historical averages. This extended transmission season likely reflects warmer autumn temperatures that prolong mosquito survival and activity, along with changes in precipitation patterns that create more persistent breeding sites. West Nile virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes, particularly Culex pipiens in Europe. These mosquitoes typically feed during evening and nighttime hours, with peak biting activity occurring at dusk and dawn. The virus cannot be transmitted person-to-person through casual contact, though rare cases of transmission through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and from mother to fetus during pregnancy have been documented.\nThe majority of WNV infections, approximately 80 percent, remain asymptomatic. About 20 percent of infected individuals develop West Nile fever, characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, body aches, joint pain, and sometimes rash. Less than 1 percent of infections progress to severe neuroinvasive disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. The risk of severe disease increases dramatically with age, particularly in individuals over 60 years, and in those with compromised immune systems due to chronic disease, immunosuppressive medications, or organ transplantation."

    "section": "Chikungunya Virus: Epidemiology and Emerging European Transmission",
    "text": "Chikungunya Virus: Epidemiology and Emerging European Transmission\nAutochthonous chikungunya transmission represents a growing public health concern in Southern Europe, marking a significant shift in the epidemiology of this arboviral disease. France has reported 768 total cases with 13 new cases documented in week 44, showing clustered transmission patterns that indicate localized outbreaks with ongoing risk for continued transmission. Italy has accumulated 370 total cases with one new case in the most recent reporting period, with geographic clustering suggesting focused transmission zones where enhanced entomological surveillance remains active.\nThe sustained transmission of chikungunya, a disease traditionally associated with tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean islands, signals the expanding range of competent vectors and the adaptation of arboviral transmission to European climates. The primary vector responsible for European transmission is Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. This highly adaptable mosquito species has successfully colonized much of Southern Europe over the past two decades, taking advantage of international trade and travel to establish populations far from its native Southeast Asian range. Unlike Culex mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus, Aedes albopictus is a daytime feeder, with peak biting activity occurring during early morning and late afternoon hours.\nChikungunya virus is transmitted directly from human to mosquito to human, without requiring a bird or animal reservoir. When a mosquito bites an infected person during the viremic phase of illness, typically during the first week of symptoms, it can acquire the virus and subsequently transmit it to other people. This direct human-to-human transmission cycle through mosquito vectors allows for rapid amplification of cases in areas with high densities of competent mosquitoes and susceptible human populations. The disease presents with sudden onset of high fever and severe joint pain, often so debilitating that patients have difficulty walking. The name “chikungunya” derives from a Kimakonde word meaning “to become contorted,” referring to the stooped posture of patients suffering from severe arthralgia. While rarely fatal, the joint pain can persist for months or even years in some patients, causing significant morbidity and reduced quality of life.\nThe establishment of autochthonous transmission in France and Italy represents a sentinel event in European infectious disease epidemiology. Previously, chikungunya cases in Europe were exclusively travel-associated, with patients having acquired infection during visits to endemic areas. The documentation of local transmission indicates that all three necessary components for sustained arboviral disease have aligned: competent vector populations, suitable climatic conditions for viral replication and transmission, and sufficient numbers of susceptible hosts. This epidemiological transition has important implications for public health preparedness and vector control strategies across the continent."

    "text": "Other Infectious Disease Activity in Europe\nMpox surveillance continues across Balkan countries, with Serbia reporting 40 confirmed cases, leading regional totals. Sporadic cases in neighboring countries demonstrate ongoing transmission, though at lower levels than observed during the peak of the 2022-2023 international outbreak. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is caused by the monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus related to the virus that causes smallpox. Unlike the arboviral diseases discussed above, mpox transmits through close contact with infected individuals, including direct contact with skin lesions, respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact, and potentially through contaminated materials such as bedding or clothing.\nThe current outbreak in Europe is predominantly caused by clade IIb of the virus and is primarily affecting networks of men who have sex with men, though transmission can occur in any setting involving close physical contact. The disease typically presents with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion, followed by the development of a characteristic rash that progresses through stages from macules to papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally scabs. Enhanced contact tracing and isolation protocols remain critical for containing transmission chains, along with targeted vaccination campaigns using modified vaccinia Ankara vaccines for high-risk populations and post-exposure prophylaxis.\nRespiratory virus activity continues under routine seasonal monitoring, with early indicators of the autumn and winter respiratory season beginning to emerge. Surveillance systems remain prepared for potential co-circulation of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which could place strain on healthcare systems if multiple respiratory pathogens circulate simultaneously at high levels. The integration of molecular diagnostics and syndromic surveillance provides early warning of shifts in respiratory disease epidemiology."

    "section": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends",
    "text": "Bulgaria: National Surveillance and Disease Trends\n\nVector-Borne Diseases in Bulgaria\nBulgaria’s position within the endemic Balkan region places it at ongoing risk for vector-borne diseases, particularly West Nile virus. During 2025, the country has documented one confirmed case of West Nile fever, representing a dramatic decline from the 28 cases reported during the same period in 2024. This substantial year-over-year reduction of 27 cases may reflect several factors, including variations in mosquito population density influenced by climatic conditions, changes in migratory bird patterns affecting viral introduction and amplification, or potentially more effective vector control measures implemented following previous seasons of high transmission.\nThe presence of WNV in Bulgaria reflects the country’s geographical position within the endemic zone that extends across the Balkans and Mediterranean basin. The Danube River basin and wetland areas provide suitable habitats for Culex mosquito species, which serve as the primary vectors for WNV transmission. These mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected migratory birds, which serve as the natural reservoir hosts. The virus then amplifies in the mosquito population and can be transmitted to humans and horses through subsequent mosquito bites. The enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes continues throughout the warm season, with human infections representing incidental spillover events rather than contributing to ongoing transmission.\nDuring week 44 specifically, no new West Nile virus cases were detected, consistent with the expected seasonal decline in transmission as temperatures decrease and mosquito populations dwindle. However, the single case documented earlier in the year serves as a reminder that surveillance infrastructure must remain vigilant for this potentially severe neuroinvasive disease.\nTick-borne diseases continue to circulate in Bulgaria, with Lyme borreliosis representing the most frequently reported tick-borne infection. Week 44 saw seven confirmed cases of Lyme borreliosis, bringing the year-to-date total to 358 cases, compared with 349 cases during the same period in 2024. This modest increase of nine cases suggests stable endemic transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato through Ixodes tick vectors. Lyme disease typically manifests initially with the characteristic erythema migrans rash at the site of tick attachment, followed potentially by disseminated infection involving the nervous system, heart, or joints if left untreated. The autumn season traditionally sees declining Lyme disease incidence as tick activity diminishes with cooler weather, though cases diagnosed in autumn often represent infections acquired during peak summer tick activity with delayed clinical presentation.\nMediterranean spotted fever, known locally as Marseilles fever, continues to be documented in Bulgaria, with one confirmed case reported during week 44, bringing the annual total to 76 cases. This represents a slight decrease from the 81 cases documented in 2024. Mediterranean spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia conorii transmitted by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The disease presents with fever, headache, and a characteristic papular rash, along with the pathognomonic tache noire, a dark eschar at the site of tick attachment. The continuing documentation of cases underscores the endemic nature of this rickettsial disease in the Balkan region.\n\n\nGastrointestinal and Foodborne Infections\nGastrointestinal infections represent a significant proportion of Bulgaria’s infectious disease burden, with multiple pathogens contributing to the overall epidemiological picture. During week 44, the country reported 178 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis of various etiologies, including 87 possible cases, 84 probable cases, and seven confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 8,194 cases represents a decrease of 479 cases compared with the 8,673 cases documented during the equivalent period in 2024, suggesting a modest downward trend in overall gastrointestinal disease burden.\nSalmonellosis continues to circulate at endemic levels, with 15 confirmed cases reported during week 44. The cumulative annual total of 612 cases represents a substantial decrease from the 856 cases documented in 2024, with the reduction of 244 cases potentially reflecting improved food safety measures, changes in agricultural practices affecting animal reservoirs, or shifts in dietary patterns affecting exposure to contaminated foods. Salmonellosis typically results from consumption of contaminated poultry products, eggs, or produce, with symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping developing 12 to 72 hours after exposure.\nCampylobacteriosis demonstrated increased activity during week 44, with 14 cases reported, bringing the annual total to 398 cases. This represents a notable increase of 119 cases compared with the 279 cases documented in 2024, potentially reflecting enhanced laboratory detection capabilities, changes in food production or handling practices, or true increases in infection incidence. Campylobacter species, particularly Campylobacter jejuni, represent the most common bacterial cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and are typically acquired through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, or contaminated water.\nRotavirus gastroenteritis continues to affect primarily pediatric populations, with 11 confirmed cases reported during week 44. The year-to-date total of 641 cases remains relatively stable compared with the 648 cases in 2024. Rotavirus remains a leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in young children despite the availability of effective vaccines, with transmission occurring through the fecal-oral route in settings where young children congregate.\nFive confirmed cases of E. coli enteritis were documented during week 44, contributing to an annual total of 275 cases. This represents a decline from the 309 cases reported in 2024. While no cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli were reported, the ongoing surveillance for these potentially severe infections remains important given their capacity to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, particularly in young children.\n\n\nRespiratory and Invasive Bacterial Infections\nCOVID-19 surveillance continues in Bulgaria, with 228 confirmed cases reported during week 44, representing a decline of 30 cases from the previous week. The year-to-date total of 2,491 cases reflects a dramatic reduction from the 14,341 cases documented during the same period in 2024, with the decrease of 11,850 cases consistent with global trends showing declining COVID-19 incidence as population immunity from vaccination and previous infection accumulates. However, the continuing documentation of several hundred cases weekly underscores that SARS-CoV-2 remains in circulation and continues to cause symptomatic disease requiring medical attention.\nVaricella, commonly known as chickenpox, demonstrated substantial activity during week 44, with 312 cases reported. The annual total of 17,781 cases represents a decrease of 4,600 cases from the 22,381 cases in 2024. Varicella remains a highly contagious disease primarily affecting children, transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular lesions. The disease typically presents with a characteristic pruritic vesicular rash along with fever and malaise. While usually self-limited in healthy children, varicella can cause serious complications in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and occasionally in healthy adults.\nScarlet fever activity continued during week 44, with 53 cases reported, including 17 possible, 26 probable, and 10 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 2,926 cases represents a substantial decrease from the 7,640 cases documented in 2024. Scarlet fever is caused by group A streptococcus producing erythrogenic toxins and presents with fever, pharyngitis, and a characteristic sandpaper-like rash. The decline may reflect natural cyclical variations in streptococcal disease activity or changes in diagnostic practices.\nInvasive bacterial meningitis cases remain under close surveillance, with three cases of bacterial meningitis due to other or unspecified organisms reported during week 44. No cases of pneumococcal, streptococcal, or Haemophilus influenzae meningitis were documented during the reporting week. The annual total of 13 meningococcal infections represents an increase from six cases in 2024, warranting continued vigilance for this potentially rapidly fatal infection.\nOne case of Legionnaires’ disease was confirmed during week 44, bringing the annual total to 11 cases, compared with 10 cases in 2024. Legionnaires’ disease results from inhalation of water aerosols contaminated with Legionella pneumophila and presents as severe pneumonia that can be fatal without appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sporadic cases typically reflect environmental exposure in buildings with contaminated water systems.\n\n\nViral Hepatitis\nAcute viral hepatitis demonstrated increased activity during week 44, with 44 cases reported, including six possible, two probable, and 36 confirmed cases. The year-to-date total of 1,236 cases represents a substantial increase of 656 cases compared with the 580 cases documented in 2024. This significant increase warrants detailed investigation to determine whether it reflects increased transmission of specific hepatitis viruses, changes in diagnostic practices with increased testing, or reporting artifacts. Viral hepatitis encompasses multiple etiologic agents including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, each with distinct epidemiologic characteristics, transmission routes, and clinical implications.\n\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSexually transmitted infections continue to represent an important public health concern in Bulgaria, with ongoing transmission of multiple pathogens documented through surveillance systems. Week 44 saw 10 confirmed HIV infections, bringing the year-to-date total to 259 cases, representing an increase of 21 cases compared with the 238 cases in 2024. This upward trend in HIV diagnoses may reflect increased transmission, improved case detection through expanded testing initiatives, or delayed diagnoses of infections acquired in previous years.\nSyphilis surveillance documented six confirmed cases during week 44, contributing to an annual total of 304 cases, compared with 282 cases in 2024. Particularly concerning is the documentation of 33 cases of congenital syphilis during 2025, a dramatic increase from the 12 cases in 2024. Congenital syphilis results from maternal-fetal transmission during pregnancy and can cause severe fetal and neonatal complications including stillbirth, neonatal death, and serious long-term sequelae in survivors. The substantial increase in congenital syphilis cases suggests gaps in prenatal screening and treatment programs that require urgent public health attention.\nUrogenital chlamydial infection showed seven confirmed cases during week 44, with the annual total of 161 cases representing a substantial increase from the 91 cases in 2024. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can cause cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease if left untreated, with potential complications including ectopic pregnancy and infertility.\nGonorrhea surveillance documented three confirmed cases during week 44, contributing to a year-to-date total of 103 cases, compared with 79 cases in 2024. The increasing trend in gonorrhea cases parallels global patterns and raises concerns about antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which has developed resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics historically used for treatment.\n\n\nRare and Emerging Infections\nSeveral rare infections were documented in Bulgaria during 2025, though no new cases occurred during week 44. Single cases of botulism, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and typhoid fever were reported during the year, along with four cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, five dengue cases, and two mpox cases. The documentation of these relatively rare infections underscores the importance of comprehensive surveillance systems capable of detecting diverse pathogens and the global mobility of populations that can introduce infections from endemic areas.\nPertussis, which caused a substantial outbreak in 2024 with 2,668 cases, has shown dramatically reduced activity in 2025, with only 82 cases reported year-to-date. This represents a decrease of 2,586 cases and likely reflects the cyclical nature of pertussis epidemiology, with epidemic peaks occurring every three to five years followed by inter-epidemic periods of low transmission."

    "text": "Public Health Implications and Disease Control Strategies\n\nUnderstanding Vector-Borne Disease Trends\nThe epidemiological data from week 44 reinforces several critical observations about the changing landscape of vector-borne diseases in Europe. The persistence of WNV and chikungunya cases into November indicates warming trends and the establishment of competent vectors across broader European territories. Historical transmission seasons for these diseases typically concluded by mid-October, but the documentation of cases extending into November suggests that climate change is creating conditions favorable for prolonged vector activity. The involvement of 13 countries in WNV surveillance, coupled with autochthonous chikungunya transmission in previously unaffected regions, demonstrates the northward expansion of arboviral disease risk.\nThe 48 fatalities associated with West Nile virus in Italy underscore the severe outcomes possible in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, necessitating targeted prevention strategies for vulnerable populations. The neuroinvasive complications of WNV infection can result in long-term disability even among survivors, with some patients experiencing persistent neurological sequelae including memory problems, difficulty with concentration, and mood disorders. This burden of disease extends beyond the acute illness and requires consideration in public health planning and resource allocation.\n\n\nIntegrated Vector Management Approaches\nControl of vector-borne diseases requires comprehensive integrated vector management strategies that combine multiple interventions to reduce disease transmission. For West Nile virus prevention, the primary focus centers on reducing Culex mosquito populations through environmental management and targeted larviciding. This includes eliminating standing water in artificial containers, treating catch basins and storm drains with larvicides, and managing vegetation around water bodies to reduce mosquito resting sites. Public health authorities conduct mosquito surveillance through trapping programs that monitor adult mosquito populations and test pools of mosquitoes for viral infection, providing early warning of viral activity before human cases occur.\nBird surveillance also plays a crucial role in WNV monitoring, as increased mortality among corvid species such as crows and blue jays often precedes human cases by several weeks. Dead bird surveillance programs allow public health officials to detect viral introduction into new areas and intensify control measures proactively. Equine surveillance provides another layer of early warning, as horses develop clinical disease with greater frequency than humans and are often infected before human cases emerge.\nFor chikungunya control, the focus shifts to managing Aedes albopictus populations, which requires different strategies than Culex control. Asian tiger mosquitoes breed in small artificial water-holding containers found in urban and suburban environments, including plant saucers, discarded tires, clogged gutters, and children’s toys. Control programs emphasize community engagement and source reduction, encouraging residents to eliminate potential breeding sites on their properties. This type of “backyard ecology” requires sustained public education campaigns and community mobilization to achieve meaningful reductions in mosquito populations. Adulticiding through ultra-low volume spraying can provide temporary relief during outbreaks but is not sustainable as a long-term control strategy due to the rapid recolonization ability of Aedes mosquitoes and concerns about insecticide resistance.\nPersonal protective measures remain essential for both WNV and chikungunya prevention. Public health messaging emphasizes the use of EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin. Wearing long sleeves and long pants, particularly during peak mosquito activity times, provides mechanical protection against bites. Installing or repairing window and door screens prevents mosquitoes from entering indoor living spaces, and the use of air conditioning when available reduces human exposure by allowing people to remain indoors during peak transmission periods.\n\n\nSurveillance and Response Systems\nActive surveillance systems across Europe continue to provide critical early warning capabilities that enable rapid public health response. Real-time case reporting through integrated surveillance platforms allows health authorities to detect clusters and outbreaks quickly, enabling targeted interventions before widespread transmission occurs. Entomological surveillance guides vector control interventions by identifying areas of high vector density and viral activity, allowing resources to be deployed efficiently to areas of greatest risk. Cross-border collaboration through ECDC and other European networks facilitates coordinated public health action, ensuring that disease trends are recognized and addressed at the regional level rather than solely within individual countries.\nRisk communication strategies adapted to local transmission intensity help maintain public awareness without generating unnecessary alarm. During periods of high transmission, public health authorities issue advisories encouraging enhanced personal protective measures and may recommend cancellation of outdoor evening activities in high-risk areas. Laboratory-based surveillance through sentinel physician networks and hospital-based reporting provides denominator data that allows calculation of disease incidence rates and monitoring of temporal trends. The integration of human, animal, and vector surveillance exemplifies the One Health approach to disease prevention, recognizing that human health is inextricably linked to animal health and environmental factors."

    "section": "Recommendations for Health Professionals",
    "text": "Recommendations for Health Professionals\nHealthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for arboviral infections in febrile patients with appropriate exposure history, particularly during the transmission season. West Nile virus should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with unexplained encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, especially in individuals over 50 years of age or with immunocompromising conditions. Diagnostic testing through serology, PCR, or viral culture should be pursued promptly, and suspected cases should be reported to national surveillance systems according to local protocols. Clinical management remains primarily supportive, as no specific antiviral therapy exists for West Nile virus or chikungunya infections.\nFor chikungunya, the characteristic severe arthralgia provides an important diagnostic clue, particularly when fever and joint pain develop suddenly in patients without recent travel to traditionally endemic areas. Clinicians should recognize that autochthonous transmission now occurs in Europe and maintain awareness of local transmission patterns. Management focuses on symptomatic relief with analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, with some patients requiring short-term use of corticosteroids for persistent arthritis.\nVector control professionals should continue eliminating mosquito breeding sites in urban and peri-urban environments through source reduction campaigns and consider larvicidal treatments in high-risk areas where breeding site elimination is not feasible. Resistance monitoring should guide insecticide selection to ensure continued efficacy of control programs. Public education campaigns should continue emphasizing personal protective measures and community participation in source reduction efforts.\nPublic health officials should anticipate potential persistence of transmission due to climate factors and prepare for the 2026 transmission season by incorporating lessons learned from current surveillance data. This includes enhancing laboratory capacity for arboviral diagnostics, training healthcare providers in recognition and management of arboviral diseases, and developing risk communication materials appropriate for diverse populations. Vaccine development efforts for West Nile virus and chikungunya should be supported, as immunization represents the most sustainable long-term approach to disease prevention."

    "title": "Epidemiological News: Week 44, 2025",
    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWeek 44 of 2025 demonstrates that infectious disease surveillance and public health preparedness remain critical across multiple geographic scales, from global pharmaceutical development to national disease monitoring systems. The 989 West Nile virus cases across Europe, hundreds of chikungunya infections establishing autochthonous transmission in previously unaffected areas, and Bulgaria’s diverse infectious disease portfolio spanning vector-borne diseases, gastrointestinal infections, sexually transmitted infections, and respiratory pathogens collectively illustrate the complex epidemiological landscape of contemporary Europe.\nThe regulatory approval of novel therapeutics for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and refractory immune thrombocytopenia by the European Medicines Agency represents significant advances in addressing conditions with substantial unmet medical needs. These pharmaceutical developments complement infectious disease control efforts by expanding the therapeutic armamentarium available to clinicians managing chronic diseases that may increase susceptibility to infections or complicate their management.\nBulgaria’s comprehensive surveillance data for week 44 and the year-to-date period reveal several epidemiological trends warranting attention. The dramatic increase in congenital syphilis cases from 12 in 2024 to 33 in 2025 represents a public health emergency requiring immediate enhancement of prenatal screening and treatment programs. The substantial increase in viral hepatitis cases, from 580 to 1,236 annually, necessitates detailed investigation to characterize the etiologic agents involved and identify transmission chains amenable to intervention. Conversely, the dramatic decline in pertussis from 2,668 cases in 2024 to 82 in 2025 demonstrates the cyclical nature of some infectious diseases and the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent resurgence.\nThe persistence of arboviral transmission into November across Europe, including Bulgaria’s participation in regional West Nile virus surveillance despite documenting only one case in 2025, signals fundamental shifts in the ecology of disease transmission. The country’s position within the endemic Balkan region places it at ongoing risk not only for West Nile virus but potentially for future introduction of chikungunya transmission should Aedes albopictus populations become established. The coordination between national surveillance systems, particularly the work of the Bulgarian National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, and European agencies such as ECDC and EFSA provides the essential foundation for effective monitoring and response to emerging and re-emerging infectious disease threats.\nThe integration of human, veterinary, and entomological surveillance through One Health approaches has proven essential for early detection and response to zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. The ability to detect viral activity in mosquito and bird populations before human cases emerge allows public health authorities to implement preventive measures and issue timely warnings to vulnerable populations. The continued refinement of these integrated surveillance systems will be crucial as climate change continues to alter the geographic distribution and seasonal timing of vector-borne disease transmission, while global travel patterns facilitate rapid pathogen dispersal across continents.\nAs Europe transitions into the cooler months, sustained vigilance remains essential across all components of the infectious disease surveillance and response infrastructure. Public health authorities are incorporating lessons learned from the 2025 transmission season into preparations for 2026, recognizing that each year provides new insights into the changing ecology of these diseases. The ongoing documentation of autochthonous chikungunya transmission in France and Italy, the concerning trends in sexually transmitted infections in Bulgaria, and the regulatory advances in chronic disease management collectively underscore that public health in the 21st century requires comprehensive, coordinated, and adaptive approaches that span infectious and non-communicable diseases, national and international boundaries, and human and animal health sectors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sociological research constitutes an essential pillar for the scientific management of healthcare systems and the advancement of social medicine. These investigations extend far beyond mere data collection exercises; they serve to formulate and evaluate optimal managerial decisions while simultaneously examining the mechanisms through which such decisions shape human behavior and social relationships. Contemporary sociological inquiry in healthcare explores how policies translate from abstract principles into concrete actions, how different categories of medical professionals perceive and implement institutional directives, and how these processes ultimately influence team dynamics and intergroup relations within healthcare organizations.\nThe integration of sociological methods into medical research has gained substantial momentum over the past two decades, reflecting a growing recognition that healthcare phenomena operate simultaneously across biological, psychological, and social dimensions. This methodological expansion requires research approaches capable of capturing this complexity, moving beyond the purely clinical to include the social context in which health and illness occur. Understanding healthcare as a social system—and not just a technical service—is the cornerstone of modern social medicine.\n\n\nSocial research in medicine pursues multiple interconnected objectives, each addressing distinct aspects of healthcare knowledge and practice. Exploratory research proves particularly valuable when investigators encounter new or substantially under-researched topics. For example, investigating patient experiences with newly implemented telemedicine platforms or exploring healthcare workers’ adaptation strategies during pandemic conditions requires an exploratory lens to identify emerging themes and unanticipated challenges. Descriptive research occupies a central position in sociological healthcare inquiry, aiming to generate rich, contextualized accounts of individuals, groups, activities, events, or situations. Rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, descriptive research seeks to document how things are experienced from the perspectives of those living through them, emphasizing what scholars term “thick descriptions” of social life.\nExplanatory research pursues an understanding of causation, correlation, and the underlying reasons why particular patterns exist in healthcare environments. When investigators seek to identify specific factors shaping attitudes toward controversial medical issues, such as vaccine hesitancy or policies regarding rare disease screening, explanatory research provides the appropriate framework to untangle the web of cultural, economic, and educational influences. Community change or action research emerges from identified needs among stakeholders for concrete interventions, representing a shift from research as passive observation to research as active engagement in social transformation. Finally, evaluation research provides a systematic assessment of program effectiveness, such as measuring the impact of a municipal air quality initiative or a hospital-based smoking cessation program, applying explanatory logic to practical questions about what works, for whom, and under what circumstances.\nThe practical application of these methods within social medicine encompasses three interconnected domains. The sociology of health and illness examines social determinants of health and illness behavior, such as how socioeconomic status influences health-seeking patterns in rural versus urban populations. Investigation into healthcare organization and delivery analyzes healthcare systems, professional relationships, and institutional dynamics, often revealing hidden hierarchies that affect patient safety. Studies of medical knowledge production scrutinize how medical theories emerge, how diagnostic categories develop, and how expert knowledge gets constructed and legitimated within professional communities.\n\n\n\nThe questionnaire represents a fundamental tool for collecting individual sociological information, composed of building blocks in the form of questions reflecting specific characteristics of researched individuals. Questions are strategically classified according to their place in the research instrument to ensure data quality and psychological flow. Introductory questions establish rapport and set the tone, while filtering questions determine respondent eligibility for subsequent sections. Main questions directly address the central research objectives, identification questions gather demographic and background information, and control questions verify response consistency and reliability.\nRegarding formulation, questions may be structured as open-ended invitations for narrative responses or closed-ended selections from predetermined options. The expected answer type further distinguishes categorical responses for discrete alternatives, ordinal responses for rankings or sequences, and continuous responses for numerical measurements. In a study on dietary habits, for instance, an ordinal scale might be used to rank the perceived importance of different food groups, while continuous responses would capture precise data on daily water intake.\nEffective questionnaire design requires transparency and rigorous adherence to ethical principles. Instruments must clearly indicate the organizing institution and specify the study topic, providing transparency about research origins and purposes. They should include direct communication to surveyed individuals explaining why they were selected, how their responses contribute to public health goals, and what specific protections ensure confidentiality. Instructions for responding must be clear and accessible, tailored to the respondents’ educational levels while avoiding technical jargon. Well-structured questionnaires maintain logical consistency, progressing coherently through topic areas within a reasonable timeframe—typically 30 to 40 minutes for self-administered formats—to avoid participant fatigue and ensure the validity of the results.\n\n\n\nWhile the questionnaire refers to the physical or digital instrument itself, the survey represents the systematic method of gathering information from a target population. Survey methods are organized based on the nature of the interaction between the researcher and the respondent. One common approach is the direct group survey, which involves the simultaneous administration of questionnaires to a group of people assembled in a specific location, such as a community center, a lecture hall, or a medical staff meeting. This method is highly efficient for collecting large amounts of data in a short period and ensures that the researcher is available to clarify any general instructions for the entire group.\nIn contrast, the direct individual survey features in-person questionnaire completion where the researcher is present with a single participant. This approach allows for a more personalized interaction where the researcher can provide immediate assistance if the respondent encounters difficult questions, which improves data completeness and quality. This is particularly useful in public health settings when surveying populations with varying levels of health literacy who might struggle with complex medical terminology.\nIndirect surveys, on the other hand, are characterized by the absence of a researcher during the completion process. Mail and online surveys are the primary forms of indirect data collection. These methods allow participants to complete the questionnaire at their own pace and in a private setting, which can lead to more honest responses on sensitive health topics. Mail surveys reach geographically dispersed populations, while online platforms offer the added benefit of rapid data aggregation and real-time analysis. However, researchers must account for the challenge of lower response rates and the lack of opportunity to provide live clarifications, which requires even greater attention to the clarity of the written instructions within the instrument.\n\n\n\nObservation constitutes a method of collecting information through direct or indirect monitoring of individual or group behavior in natural environments. This approach distinguishes itself according to researcher involvement, ranging from complete participation where investigators fully engage in observed activities to participant observation where researchers balance engagement with systematic documentation. Some studies require complete observation, where investigators maintain detached external perspectives to minimize interference.\nObservation studies capture events as they unfold in real-time rather than relying on retrospective recall subject to memory distortions. Modern technical means, including audio and video recording, dramatically enhance observational research capabilities, enabling preservation of behavioral sequences for repeated examination. In a clinical setting, observation might be used to analyze hand hygiene compliance or the dynamics of multidisciplinary team meetings, providing insights that self-reported surveys might overlook due to social desirability bias.\nDespite these strengths, observational research presents significant limitations. It documents what happens in the present moment rather than what occurred previously or what future developments might unfold. It typically has a limited scope and requires substantial personnel investment over extended periods. Analysts must also be cognizant of the Hawthorne effect, a phenomenon where individuals change their behavior simply because they are aware they are being monitored, which can lead to data that does not accurately reflect routine practice.\n\n\n\nThe research interview representing a fundamental form of inquiry grounded in direct verbal communication is a sophisticated extension of social medicine. It is essential to distinguish research interviews from clinical history-taking. In clinical practice, the physician assumes an interviewer role to pursue diagnostic categorization and treatment planning. In contrast, research interviews aim to discover participants’ own meanings and avoid imposing prior assumptions or preset medical frameworks.\nAn effective research interview demands particular psychological qualities and sociological training. Unlike survey administration where questions merely require reading, interviewing requires establishing an atmosphere of trust and openness. During conversations, opinions and beliefs require non-judgmental reception, avoiding criticism or lecturing that inhibits authentic expression. Interviews should progress from general, non-threatening questions to more personal or sensitive topics, allowing participants to guide the thematic development. This is particularly crucial when discussing sensitive public health issues like mental health stigma or reproductive health experiences, where the respondent’s comfort level directly impacts the depth of information shared.\nInterviews can be classified by their level of structure. Highly structured formats follow predetermined question sequences, while unstructured interviews follow participant-driven directions. The most common type in healthcare is the semi-structured interview, which balances systematic coverage of core themes with the flexibility to explore unexpected but significant issues that emerge during the dialogue. Interviews can be conducted with individuals to capture personal narratives or with groups, such as focus group discussions, to reveal social norms and collective attitudes towards a specific health intervention.\n\n\n\nThe methodological toolkit of social medicine extends to documentary analysis, which captures different dimensions of healthcare experience and organizational processes through existing materials. This involves collecting primary empirical information from documents primarily created for other purposes, such as medical records, official reports, institutional policies, personal correspondence, and professional communications.\nDocumentary research methods offer the opportunity to objectify social facts through examination of formal records. Documents create audit trails documenting decisions, policies, and actions that participants might inaccurately recall or retrospectively rationalize during an interview. They also permit historical investigation spanning decades, allowing researchers to track the evolution of public health policies or the changing social perception of specific diseases. However, documents are not neutral; they are social constructions created for specific administrative or legal purposes. Therefore, they require critical interpretation regarding authorship, audience, and the original context of their creation.\nAll sociological studies in medicine follow a logical sequence from the preparation phase to the conducting and analysis phases. The preparation phase begins with defining the research problem and reviewing existing literature, followed by the formulation of specific tasks and the design of the study, including pilot testing. The conducting phase involves the actual collection of data through the chosen methods. Finally, the analysis phase involves organizing the data, identifying patterns, and interpreting the findings to provide actionable insights for healthcare management and public health policy. When approached with methodological sophistication, this cycle ensures that the full range of sociological research methods provides essential insights into the complex social machinery of modern medicine."

Комитетът по лекарствените продукти за хуманна употреба препоръча одобрение на два нови терапевтични агента, които адресират здравни състояния с недостатъчно лечение, като същевременно отказа разрешение за един продукт, предназначен за лечение на реакция на присадка срещу гостоприемник.\nBrinsupri, съдържащ активното вещество бренсокатиб, получи положително становище като първото разрешено лечение специфично за некистична фиброзна бронхиектазия. Това хронично белодробно състояние засяга хиляди пациенти в Европа и се характеризира с трайно разширяване и увреждане на бронхиалните дихателни пътища, произтичащо от рецидивиращи инфекции, възпаление и нарушен мукоцилиарен клирънс. Пациентите с бронхиектазия изпитват хронична продуктивна кашлица, рецидивиращи белодробни инфекции, прогресивно влошаване на белодробната функция и значително увредено качество на живот. Заболяването обикновено следва прогресивен ход с редуващи се периоди на клинична стабилност и остри екзацербации, изискващи антибиотична терапия, а понякога и хоспитализация. Brinsupri е базиран на механизъм, насочен срещу неутрофилните серинови протеази, които играят централна роля във възпалителната каскада, движеща прогресията на бронхиектазията. Този медикамент адресира значими здравни нужди, тъй като предишните стратегии за лечение се основаваха предимно на симптоматично лечение с бронходилататори, муколитици и антибиотици без модифициране на основния възпалителен процес.\nWayrilz, с активното вещество рилзабрутиниб, получи положителна препоръка за лечение на имунна тромбоцитопения при възрастни пациенти, които са се оказали рефрактерни към други терапевтични интервенции. Имунната тромбоцитопения е автоимунно заболяване, характеризиращо се с ускорено разрушаване на тромбоцити и неадекватна продукция на нови такива. Това поставя пациентите в риск от спонтанно кървене, включително потенциално животозастрашаващ вътречерепен кръвоизлив. Състоянието значително влияе върху ежедневните дейности на пациентите, тъй като тези с тежка тромбоцитопения трябва да ограничат физическата активност, за да избегнат травма, и могат да изпитват умора, петехии, пурпура и кървене от лигавиците. Wayrilz функционира като инхибитор на Брутоновата тирозин киназа (BTK), която насочва В-клетъчната и макрофагната функция в производството на антитромбоцитни антитела и разрушаването на тромбоцитите. За пациенти, при които конвенционални терапии са се оказли неуспешни, включително високи дози кортикостероиди, интравенозен имуноглобулин, агонисти на тромбопоетиновия рецептор и спленектомия, този нов медикамент предоставя важна алтернатива.\nКомитетът отказа да препоръча разрешение за Rezurock (съдържащ белумосудил) за лечение на реакция на присадка срещу гостоприемник (graft-versus-host disease, GVHD). Това решение отразява стриктния процес на оценка, прилаган от европейските регулаторни органи, с цел да се гарантира, че ползите от даден медикамент надвишават потенциалните рискове при неговото използване. Основните причини за отрицателното становище включват неясна ефективност и липса на ефект при първа линия на лечение (В клинично проучване, в което Rezurock е използван като терапия от първа линия, не са наблюдавани значими ползи, което е било ключов фактор за негативното становище.) В допълнение компанията Sanofi е заявила, че няма да успее да предостави нови данни за ефективността преди 2030 г., което възпрепятства възможността за издаване на условно разрешение за употреба."

    "text": "Европа: Инфекциозните Болести\n\nЗападнонилска треска\nКъм 3 октомври 2025 г. европейската система за наблюдение е регистрирала 989 потвърдени случая на ЗНТ в 13 държави-членки. Италия води с 714 случая, от които 48 са починали. Основно засегнатите региони включват Лацио и Кампания, където екологичните условия благоприятстват постоянно размножаване на комари и популации на птици, които поддържат циркулацията на вируса. Смъртността подчертава тежестта на инфекциите при уязвими популации, особено възрастните и тези с имуносупресия. Гърция, Сърбия и други балкански държави продължават да докладват активно предаване (първите случаи бяха регистрирани през Юли).\nГеографското разпределение демонстрира устойчивото установяване на цикли на предаване на ЗНТ в Южна и Югоизточна Европа, като комарите-вектори поддържат висока активност дори в края на лятото и началото на есента. Вирусът на ЗНТ се предава главно чрез ухапване от заразени комари от род Culex, особено Culex pipiens. Тези комари обикновено се хранят през вечерните и нощните часове, с пикова активност на ухапване по здрач и зазоряване. Вирусът не може да се предава от човек на човек чрез случаен контакт, въпреки че са документирани редки случаи на предаване чрез кръвопреливане, трансплантация на органи и от майка на плод по време на бременност.\nМнозинството от инфекциите с ЗНТ, приблизително 80 процента, остават безсимптомни. Около 20 процента от заразените индивиди развиват заболяване, характеризиращо се с внезапно начало на температура, главоболие, болки в мускули и стави и понякога обрив. По-малко от 1 процент от инфекциите прогресират до тежко невроинвазивно заболяване, включително енцефалит, менингит или остра вяла парализа. Рискът от тежко заболяване се увеличава драматично с възрастта, особено при индивиди над 60 години, и при тези с имуносупресия.\n\n\nЧикунгуня: Епидемиология и Появяващо се Европейско Предаване\nАвтохтонното предаване на чикунгуня представлява нарастваща загриженост за общественото здраве в Южна Европа, маркирайки значителна промяна в епидемиологията на това заболяване. Франция е докладвала общо 768 случая с 13 нови случая, документирани тази седмица. Учените там говорят за “групирани модели” на предаване, които предполагат наличието на локализирани огнища с продължаващ риск за предаване. Италия е натрупала 370 случаи с един нов случай в тази седмица и с отчетливо географско групиране.\nУстойчивото предаване на чикунгуня, заболяване традиционно свързано с тропически и субтропически региони на Африка, Азия и островите в Индийския океан, сигнализира за разширяващия се обхват на компетентни вектори и адаптацията на предаването към европейските климатични условия. Основният вектор, отговорен за европейското предаване, е Aedes albopictus. Този високо адаптивен вид комар успешно е колонизирал голяма част от Южна Европа през последните две десетилетия, възползвайки се от международната търговия и пътувания, за да установи популации далеч от своя роден Югоизточноазиатски обхват. За разлика от комарите Culex, които предават вируса на ЗНТ, Aedes albopictus се храни през деня, с пикова активност на ухапване през ранните сутрешни и късните следобедни часове.\nВирусът чикунгуня се предава директно във веригата човек -&gt; комар -&gt; човек, без да изисква птичи или животински резервоар. Когато комар ухапе заразено лице по време на виремичната фаза на заболяването, обикновено през първата седмица от симптомите, той може да придобие вируса и впоследствие да го предаде на други хора. Този директен цикъл на предаване от човек на човек чрез комари-вектори позволява бърза амплификация на случаите в райони с висока плътност на компетентни комари и податливи човешки популации. Заболяването се проявява с внезапно начало на висока треска и тежка ставна болка, често толкова инвалидизираща, че пациентите имат трудности при ходене. Името “чикунгуня” произлиза от думата на Кимаконде, означаваща “да се изкривиш”, отнасяща се до прегърбената поза на пациенти, страдащи от тежка артралгия. Макар рядко фатална, ставната болка може да персистира месеци или дори години при някои пациенти, причинявайки значителна морбидност и намалено качество на живот.\nУстановяването на автохтонно предаване във Франция и Италия представлява сигнално събитие в европейската епидемиология на инфекциозните болести. Преди това случаите на чикунгуня в Европа бяха изключително свързани с пътувания, като пациентите бяха придобили инфекцията по време на посещения в ендемични райони. Документирането на локално предаване показва, че всички три необходими компонента за устойчиво арбовирусно заболяване са се изравнили: популации на компетентни вектори, подходящи климатични условия за вирусна репликация и предаване, и достатъчен брой податливи гостоприемници. Тази епидемиологична трансформация има важни последици за готовността на общественото здраве и стратегиите за контрол на векторите в целия континент.\n\n\nДруга инфекциозна активност в Европа\nСърбия докладва 40 потвърдени случая на маймунска вариола (mpox). Спорадични случаи в съседни страни (Гърция, Македония, Турция, Румъния) демонстрират продължаващо предаване, макар и на по-ниски нива от тези, наблюдавани по време на пика на международното огнище от 2022-2023 г. Маймунската вариола се причинява от ортопоксвирус, свързан с вируса, причиняващ едра шарка. За разлика от арбовирусните заболявания, обсъдени по-горе, маймунската вариола се предава чрез близък контакт със заразени индивиди, включително директен контакт с кожни лезии, респираторни капчици по време на продължителен контакт лице в лице и потенциално чрез замърсени материали като спално бельо или облекло.\nНастоящото огнище в Европа е предимно причинено от клад IIb на вируса и засяга предимно мрежи мъже с интимни контакти с мъже (МИКМ). Заболяването обикновено се проявява с треска, главоболие, мускулни болки и изтощение, последвани от развитието на характерен обрив, който прогресира през етапи от макули до папули, везикули, пустули и накрая крусти. Засиленото проследяване на контакти и протоколи за изолация остават критични за ограничаване на веригите на предаване, заедно с насочени ваксинационни кампании.\nАктивността на респираторните вируси продължава под рутинно сезонно наблюдение. Системите за наблюдение остават подготвени за потенциална ко-циркулация на грип, респираторен синцитиален вирус и SARS-CoV-2."

    "text": "България\n\nВекторно преносими болести\nПозицията на България в ендемичния балкански регион я поставя в продължаващ риск от векторно преносими болести, особено за ЗНТ. През 2025 г. страната е документирала един потвърден случай, представляващ драматичен спад от 28-те случая, докладвани през същия период през 2024 г. Това съществено намаление може да отразява няколко фактора, включително вариации в плътността на комарската популация, повлияна от климатични условия, промени в миграционните модели на птиците, засягащи вирусното въвеждане и амплификация, или потенциално по-ефективни мерки за контрол на векторите.\nЗаболяванията, предавани от кърлежи, продължават да циркулират в България, като лаймската борелиоза представлява най-често докладваната инфекция, предавана от кърлежи. През изминалата седмица са регистрирани седем потвърдени случая на лаймска борелиоза, а с тях от началото на годината са докладни общо 358 случая, в сравнение с 349 случая през същия период през 2024 г. Това умерено увеличение предполага стабилно ендемично предаване на Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato чрез кърлежи-вектори от род Ixodes. Лаймската болест обикновено се проявява първоначално с характерния си обрив - еритема мигранс на мястото на прикрепване на кърлежа, последван потенциално от дисеминирана инфекция, засягаща нервната система, сърцето или ставите. Есенният сезон традиционно е свързван с намаляваща честота на лаймската болест, тъй като активността на кърлежите намалява, въпреки че случаите, диагностицирани през есента, често представляват инфекции, придобити по време на пиковата лятна активност с забавена клинична проява.\nТази седмица е докладван е и един случай на марсилска треска, довеждайки годишната обща стойност до 76 случая. Това представлява леко намаление от 81-те случая, документирани през 2024 г. Средиземноморската петниста треска се причинява от Rickettsia conorii, предавана от кафявия кучешки кърлеж Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Заболяването се проявява с треска, главоболие и характерен папулозен обрив, заедно с патогномоничната tache noire, тъмен струпей на мястото на прикрепване на кърлежа. Продължаващото документиране на случаи подчертава ендемичната природа на това рикетсиално заболяване в балканския регион.\n\n\nСтомашно-Чревни и Хранително Предавани Инфекции\nСтомашно-чревните инфекции представляват значителна част от бремето на инфекциозните болести в България, като множество патогени допринасят за общата епидемиологична картина. През изминалата седмица в страната ни са докладвани 178 случая на гастроентерит и ентероколит от различни причинители. Общата стойност на заболелите от началото на годината е 8 194, което представлява намаление от 479 случая в сравнение с 2024 г.\nСалмонелозата продължава да циркулира на ендемични нива, с 15 потвърдени случая. Кумулативната годишна обща стойност е 612 случая, което е значително по-малко от 856-те случая, документирани през 2024 г. Описаното намаление вероятно отразява подобрени мерки за безопасност на храните, промени в земеделските практики, засягащи животински резервоари, или промени в хранителните модели, засягащи експозицията на замърсени храни.\nКампилобактериозата демонстрира повишена активност през периода с 14 нови докладвани случая. До момента са регистрирани с 119 случая повече спрямо 2024 г. Видовете Campylobacter, особено Campylobacter jejuni, представляват най-честата бактериална причина за гастроентерит в световен мащаб и обикновено се придобиват чрез консумация на недоварено птиче месо, непастьоризирано мляко или замърсена вода.\nРотавирусният гастроентерит продължава да засяга предимно педиатричните популации, с 11 нови потвърдени случая. Общата стойност от началото на годината от 641 случая остава относително стабилна спрямо 2024 г. Ротавирусът остава водеща причина за тежка дехидратираща диария при малки деца, въпреки наличността на ефективни ваксини, като предаването се случва чрез фекално-оралния път в условия, където се събират малки деца.\n\n\nРеспираторни инфекции\nНаблюдението на COVID-19 разкрива 228 нови потвърдени случая, което е спад от 30 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Общата стойност от началото на годината е 2 491.\nВарицелата демонстрира съществена активност с нови 312 заболели. От началото на година до момента са регистрирани 17 781 случая, което е намаление с 4 600 случая спрямо същия период на 2024 г. Варицелата остава високо заразна болест, засягаща предимно деца, предавана чрез респираторни капчици и директен контакт с везикулни лезии. Заболяването обикновено се проявява с характерен сърбящ везикулен обрив заедно с треска. Въпреки че обикновено е самоограничаваща се при здрави деца, варицелата може да причини сериозни усложнения при имунокомпрометирани индивиди, бременни жени и понякога при здрави възрастни.\nАктивността на скарлатината продължава на стабилни нива спрямо 2024 г. с 53 нови докладвани случая, включително 17 възможни, 26 вероятни и 10 потвърдени.\nСлучаите на бактериален менингит остават под внимателно наблюдение, с три нови заболели докладвани през седмицата.\nПрез 44-та седмица се установява и един заболял с легионеонелоза. Legionella pneumophila се проявява като тежка пневмония, която може да бъде фатална без подходяща антибиотична терапия. Спорадичните случаи обикновено отразяват екологична експозиция в сгради със замърсени водни системи.\n\n\nВирусен Хепатит\nОстрият вирусен хепатит демонстрира повишена активност през 44-та седмица, с 44 докладвани случая, в това число шест възможни, два вероятни и 36 потвърдени.\n\n\nСексуално Предавани Инфекции\nСексуално предаваните инфекции продължават да представляват важна загриженост за общественото здраве в България, с продължаващо предаване на множество патогени, документирано чрез системите за наблюдение. През изминалата седмица са регистрирани 10 нови пациенти с потвърдена HIV инфекция.\nНаблюдението на сифилис документира шест потвърдени случая, допринасяйки за натрупването от 304 случая от началото на годината. Особено притеснително е документирането на общо 33 случая на вроден сифилис до момента, което е драматично увеличение спрямо 12-те случая през същият период на 2024 г.\nУстановени са още 3 нови потвърдени случая на гонорея. Нарастващата тенденция в случаите е паралелна на глобалните модели и повдига загрижености относно антимикробната резистентност."

Според текущата класификация на ECDC няма регистрирани варианти на загриженост (VOC). Въпреки това се проследяват един вариант от интерес (VOI) и два варианта под наблюдение (VUM), които заедно представляват по-голямата част от секвенираните проби.\nМедианните пропорции на VOI и VUM за седмици 41–42 в държавите от ЕС/ЕИП (на база данни от пет държави) показват следното разпределение: вариантът BA.2.86 (VOI) представлява 4,4% от секвенираните проби (обхват: 0,0–14,0%; интерквартилен размах [IQR]: 2,9–7,3%); NB.1.8.1 (VUM) – 10,5% (обхват: 2,3–30,0%; IQR: 4,6–12,9%); а XFG (VUM) остава доминиращ – 85,0% (обхват: 60,0–86,5%; IQR: 82,2–86,2%).\nНаселението на ЕС/ЕИП е придобило значителен хибриден имунитет вследствие на прекарани предходни инфекции и/или ваксинация, което осигурява висока степен на защита срещу тежко протичане на заболяването. Наличните данни сочат, че циркулиращите в момента варианти, категоризирани като VOI и VUM, не са свързани с повишена тежест на клиничното протичане, нито със значимо намаляване на ефективността на ваксините срещу тежко заболяване в сравнение с предходни варианти.\nВъпреки това, някои групи от населението остават уязвими към тежко протичане на COVID-19. Това включва лица на и над 65-годишна възраст, хора с хронични заболявания или състояния, отслабващи имунната или кардиореспираторната система, както и лица без предишна инфекция, при които рискът от развитие на тежки симптоми и необходимост от хоспитализация остава повишен.\n\n\n\nОгнището на ебола в провинция Касай, Демократична република Конго (ДРК), което започна в началото на септември 2025 г., навлиза в заключителната си фаза с очаквано официално обявяване на неговото прекратяване. На 19 октомври 2025 г. Световната здравна организация (СЗО) съобщи, че последният пациент с ебола е изписан след успешно лечение, с което започна 42-дневният период на активно наблюдение до обявяване на край на огнището. Този период съответства на два пъти максималния инкубационен период на заболяването и служи като предпазна мярка за потвърждаване, че в общността не протичат неидентифицирани вериги на предаване.\nКъм 6 ноември 2025 г. не са регистрирани нови случаи от 26 септември 2025 г. насам. От общо 1 787 идентифицирани контактни лица, 1 735 (97,3%) са приключили своя период на медицинско проследяване, като няма лица, оставащи под активно наблюдение. При липса на нови случаи, огнището се очаква да бъде официално обявено за приключило в началото на декември 2025 г., което ще го направи 16-тото регистрирано огнище на ебола в ДРК от откриването на вируса през 1976 г. насам.\nОт обявяването на огнището на 4 септември 2025 г. са докладвани общо 64 случая – 53 лабораторно потвърдени и 11 вероятни (базирани на клинични и епидемиологични критерии), както и 45 смъртни случая (34 сред потвърдените и 11 сред вероятните случаи), което съответства на леталитет от 70,3%. Всички случаи са регистрирани в шест здравни района в зоната Булапе, а географската и епидемиологичната картина подкрепя хипотезата за единично зоонотично пренасяне, последвано от ограничени вериги на предаване от човек на човек.\n\n\n\nПрез 2025 г. холерата продължава да представлява значимо глобално предизвикателство за общественото здраве. В периода от 1 януари до 29 октомври 2025 г. в световен мащаб са докладвани 562 449 случая, включително 7 201 починали.

При векторнопреносимите инфекции са отчетени 5 случая на Лаймска борелиоза, без нови случаи на марсилска треска, Кримска-Конго хеморагична треска, денга или западнонилска треска.\nCOVID-19 продължава да циркулира с 162 потвърдени случая, разпределени в почти всички области, но с изразен спад спрямо предходната седмица. Регистрирани са 4 случая на вирусни менингити/менингоенцефалити и 1 случай на менингококова инфекция. При вирусните хепатити се наблюдава значително натрупване от началото на годината – 1 278 случая, повече от два пъти над стойностите за 2024 г., което изисква задълбочен епидемиологичен анализ.\nПри сексуално предаваните инфекции се регистрират 8 нови случая на HIV, 5 на сифилис (годишно общо 309), 6 на урогенитална хламидийна инфекция и 2 на гонорея. Особено тревожна остава тенденцията при вродения сифилис, с 33 случая от началото на годината срещу 12 за 2024 г., което сигнализира за пропуски в пренаталния скрининг и ранната диагностика.\nНяма регистрирани случаи на холера, туларемия, орнитоза, антракс, кърлежов енцефалит, лептоспироза, ку-треска, морбили, ботулизъм и болест на Кройцфелд–Якоб през отчетната седмица."

Сред най-значимите решения се откроява одобрението за Teizeild (teplizumab) като първи в класа си медикамент, способен да забави настъпването на стадий 3 на тип 1 диабет при възрастни и деца от осемгодишна възраст, при които е налице стадий 2 на заболяването. Това лекарство получава подкрепа чрез схемата PRIME на ЕМА, която осигурява засилена научна и регулаторна подкрепа за обещаващи терапии, адресиращи неудовлетворени медицински потребности. Възможността да се повлияе естественият ход на тип 1 диабет още преди развитието на тежка хипергликемия представлява промяна на парадигмата в грижите за това заболяване.\nWaskyra (etuvetidigene autotemcel) представлява друг ключов етап като първата генна терапия, одобрена за синдром на Wiskott–Aldrich – рядко наследствено заболяване, засягащо тромбоцитите и функцията на имунната система, почти изключително при мъже. Генната терапия продължава да разширява терапевтичния си обхват, като това одобрение се присъединява към нарастващо портфолио от потенциално лечебни подходи за преди нелечими генетични заболявания. Dawnzera (donidalorsen) също предлага нова надежда, като медикамента е предназначен за пациенти с наследствен ангиоедем, осигурявайки рутинна профилактика на повтарящи се пристъпи на отоци, които могат да засегнат лицето, гърлото, крайниците и гастроинтестиналния тракт при възрастни и юноши на дванадесет и повече години.\nОнкологичното портфолио се разшири с Inluriyo (imlunestrant) за лечение на локално авансирал или метастатичен рак на гърдата със специфични мутации в ESR1, а диагностичните възможности се надграждат и с GalenVita, генератор на радионуклиди, произвеждащ разтвор на gallium-68 хлорид за позитронно-емисионна томография при различни видове тумори. В областта на профилактичната медицина беше одобрена Vacpertagen, ацелуларна ваксина срещу коклюш, предназначена за употреба във всички възрастови групи.\nКомитетът препоръча също два биоподобни продукта – Ondibta (insulin glargine) за захарен диабет и Osqay (denosumab) за остеопороза, които ще повишат достъпността на лечението. Генерична версия на teduglutide получи положително становище за синдром на късото черво, като допълнително разширява възможностите за достъпно лечение. Разширяване на терапевтичните показания беше препоръчано за четири съществуващи лекарства: Koselugo, Minjuvi, Veyvondi и Xerava, с което се увеличава клиничната им приложимост.\nТри заявления за разрешение за употреба бяха оттеглени по време на заседанието. Insulin Aspart Injection за диабет при възрастни и деца, Nurzigma (pridopidine) за болест на Huntington и Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine) за хронична обструктивна белодробна болест бяха прекратени по инициатива на заявителите. В допълнение, след повторен преглед на Aqneursa (levacetylleucine) за болест на Niemann–Pick тип C, комитетът потвърди първоначалната си препоръка да не разглежда levacetylleucine като ново активно вещество. Притежателят на разрешението за Rezurock (belumosudil) поиска повторен преглед на отрицателното становище от октомври 2025 г., като се очаква комитетът да издаде окончателна препоръка след разглеждане на основанията за това искане."

    "text": "Инфекциозни заболявания: глобална и европейска перспектива\n\nВъздушно-капкови инфекции\nНадзорът върху морбили в Европа през септември 2025 г. показва очакван сезонен спад, като са докладвани 90 случая от 11 държави, докато 17 държави не съобщават случаи. Въпреки това дванадесетмесечният период от октомври 2024 г. до септември 2025 г. включва 10 195 случая на морбили в 30 държави членки на ЕС/ЕИП, като 71,3% са лабораторно потвърдени. Възрастовото разпределение показва уязвимост през целия жизнен цикъл, като 40,5% от случаите са при деца под пет години, а 32,5% – при лица на 15 и повече години. Най-висока е заболяемостта при кърмачета под една година – 336,4 случая на милион население, следвани от деца на 1–4 години със 174,6 на милион. Огромното мнозинство от случаите са при неваксинирани лица, които представляват 81,1% от всички случаи, докато лицата с две или повече дози ваксина са 7%. През този период са съобщени осем смъртни случая – пет в Румъния, два във Франция и един в Нидерландия, което дава леталитет 0,074%.\nПоследният анализ на епидемичната информация, проведен на 13 и 14 ноември, разкри активен взрив на морбили на Канарските острови с 21 случая на островите Ла Палма, Гран Канария и Тенерифе. Взривът започва на 20 октомври с три случая, включително две деца и здравен работник, и се разширява с още седем нови случая през настоящата седмица – пет възрастни в Ла Палма и два случая в Гран Канария. Епидемиологичното проучване проследява индексния случай до контакт с предходно установен случай в Тенерифе. Новите случаи протичат леко и се възстановяват без усложнения, но здравните власти продължават активното проследяване на контактните лица. Испания като цяло е съобщила 379 случая към 9 ноември, което представлява увеличение с 35 случая спрямо 30 септември, с 108 внесени случая и 92 случая, свързани с внесени инфекции.\nИзвън Европа Канада е загуби статута си на страна с елиминирано морбили според уведомление на Панамериканската здравна организация поради продължаващ многорегионален взрив с продължителност над 12 месеца. Към 10 ноември Канада е съобщила 5 162 случая, включително два смъртни случая при недоносени новородени с вродена инфекция. Съединените щати са съобщили 1 723 потвърдени случая с три смъртни изхода в 43 юрисдикции, като 92% от случаите са при неваксинирани лица или при такива с неизвестен ваксинален статус. Ситуацията в Мексико остава тежка с 5 257 потвърдени случая и 23 смъртни изхода до 43-та седмица, като по-голямата част от случаите са концентрирани в щата Чиуауа с 4 440 случая и 21 смъртни изхода. В Африка са докладвани 129 680 случая и 1 110 смъртни изхода в 20 държави, което съответства на леталитет 0,79%.\nНадзорът върху грипните инфекции показва по-ранно начало на сезон 2025–2026 в сравнение с предходните две години, като циркулацията се увеличава с три до четири седмици по-рано от обичайните модели. През 45-та седмица първичната доболнична мрежа е регистрирала 167 случая на грип, като преобладава грип А, който представлява 98,2% от детекциите. Сред субтипизираните вируси тип А A(H3) представлява 68%, а A(H1)pdm09 – 32%, което бележи промяна на доминиращия субтип. Най-голям брой детекции се наблюдават при деца на 5–14 години, в съответствие с познатите епидемиологични модели. Генетичната характеристика на 83 вируса от 40-та до 45-та седмица показва, че вирусите A(H1)pdm09 принадлежат предимно към клон 5a.2a.1(D.3.1), представлявайки 97% от характеризираните щамове, докато вирусите A(H3) в 86% от случаите принадлежат към клон 2a.3a.1(K). Въпреки нарастващата грипна активност, въздействието върху хоспитализациите към момента остава ограничено, като в надзора на тежките остри респираторни инфекции през 45-та седмица са отчетени 52 грипни детекции.\nПоказателите за SARS-CoV-2 демонстрират стабилни или намаляващи тенденции в Европа, със 155 детекции в първичната доболнична помощ и 23 в болничните заведения през 45-та седмица. Наблюдението на вариантите за 43–44-та седмица показва продължаващо доминиране на варианта XFG, който представлява 78% от детекциите в пет държави и е класифициран като вариант под наблюдение. Вариантът NB.1.8.1 представлява 8% от детекциите, докато BA.2.86, класифициран като вариант от интерес, представлява 4%. Текущите нива на циркулация на COVID-19 остават значително под тези от есента на 2024 г., в съответствие с прехода към ендемични модели на разпространение.\nЦиркулацията на респираторния синцитиален вирус се увеличава през последните седмици, но остава на ниски нива, като през 45-та седмица са регистрирани 17 детекции в първичната доболнична помощ и 21 в болничните заведения. Кумулативните данни от 40-та до 45-та седмица показват 97 детекции в първичната доболнична мрежа и 111 в болнични условия. Детекциите на RSV се наблюдават предимно при деца под петгодишна възраст, а времевите тенденции наподобяват предходния сезон, което предполага типично сезонно начало. И RSV-A, и RSV-B циркулират, като RSV-A представлява между една трета и три четвърти от типизираните детекции в зависимост от надзорната среда.\n\n\nВекторно-преносими инфекции\nТрансмисията на вируса на Западнонилска треска в Европа приключва за сезон 2025, като най-късната дата на начало на случай е 27 октомври сред общо 1 096 локално придобити човешки инфекции. Италия преживява най-интензивната циркулация с 773 случая, включително 71 смъртни изхода, което съответства на леталитет 9,2% в очакваните граници, но представлява най-високия брой човешки инфекции, регистрирани в Италия към този момент на годината. Регион Лацио е основният епицентър с 265 случая, концентрирани в провинциите Латина, Рома и Фрозиноне, докато регион Кампания съобщава 133 случая, разпределени в провинциите Неапол, Казерта, Салерно и Авелино. Другите региони на Италия съобщават за брой случаи, сходен с предходни години, което показва, че разширяването на взрива засяга предимно централните региони.\nСезон 2025 въвежда вируса на Западнонилска треска в 35 региона, които за първи път съобщават човешки случаи, включително 17 италиански региона – от северни провинции като Генуа и Сондрио до южни области като Реджо ди Калабрия и няколко сицилиански провинции. Франция съобщава първи случаи в 14 региона, включително и в парижкия метрополен район с случаи в самия Париж и шест околни департамента, което предполага градска трансмисия. Този модел на градско разпространение представлява значимо епидемиологично развитие, тъй като Западнонилската треска традиционно се свързва с селски и влажни зони. Германия, Гърция, Испания, Хърватия, Косово, Румъния и Турция съобщават първи случаи в от един до три региона.\nОт ветеринарна гледна точка през 2025 г. са докладвани 178 огнища сред еднокопитни и 345 огнища сред птици в Европа. Времевото разпределение показва активност на огнищата от средата на януари до края на октомври, като най-ранното огнище при еднокопитни започва на 15 януари в Германия, а най-ранното при птици – на 16 февруари в Италия. Италия доминира и в двете категории, като отчита 86 от 178-те огнища при еднокопитни и 318 от 345-те огнища при птици, отразявайки както интензивен надзор, така и благоприятни екологични условия за циркулация на вируса. Белгия съобщава за вируса на Западнонилска треска за първи път с три огнища при птици през август 2025 г. при гарвани и врани в административните единици Мехелен и Хале–Вилворде. Нидерландия също съобщава за първо огнище при еднокопитни в Системата за информация за болестите по животните през октомври 2025 г., въпреки че вирусът преди това е бил детектиран при комари, птици и хора от 2020 г. насам.\nНадзорът върху птиците идентифицира черната врана като видът, свързан с най-голям брой огнища – 95, следвана от свраката с 59 огнища и гугутката с 30 огнища. Тези представители на семейство Corvidae служат като особено чувствителни индикатори за циркулация на вируса на Западнонилска треска поради високата си чувствителност и видимите смъртни събития. С понижаването на температурите в Европа и намаляването на активността на комарите се очакват само спорадични човешки случаи в следващите седмици и може да се счита, че сезонът на трансмисия за 2025 г. практически е приключил.\nГлобалният надзор върху денга регистрира над 4,5 милиона случая и повече от 3 000 смъртни изхода от 103 държави и територии от началото на 2025 г. Регионът на Америка съобщава 3,9 милиона случая до 40-та седмица, което представлява 68% намаление в сравнение със същия период на 2024 г., но все още е с 9% над средното за последните пет години. Пикът на случаите е през 12–14-та седмица на 2025 г., след което се наблюдава спад. Всички четири серотипа на вируса на денга продължават да циркулират с различно географско разпределение. Бразилия поддържа най-високото бреме с случаи, регистрирани във всички региони, макар и при тенденция към намаляване от юни до октомври. В Куба взривът обхваща всички 14 провинции, но намаляващите случаи на фебрилни синдроми подсказват ефект от предприетите мерки.\nВ Азия броят на случаите на денга достига 136 233, което представлява 31,5% намаление в сравнение със същия период на 2024 г., като най-голямото бреме е в Югоизточна Азия. Бангладеш демонстрира продължаващо нарастване от август насам с 6 235 нови случая за седмицата 27 октомври – 2 ноември, а кумулативните стойности за 2025 г. надхвърлят тези за същия период на 2024 г. Виетнам показва нарастваща тенденция със 122 979 случая и 23 смъртни изхода към 17 октомври. Китай съобщава 5 280 случая до края на септември, по-малко в сравнение със същия период на 2024 г., макар че месечният брой случаи се увеличава от 1 702 през август до 2 321 през септември. Провинция Гуангдонг остава основно засегнатият регион. В Сингапур взривът, започнал в началото на август с първоначални случаи при пътуващи, завърнали се от Гуангдонг, продължава през септември и октомври.\nВ рамките на ЕС/ЕИП сезонният надзор върху денга отчита 29 автохтонни случая във Франция и четири в Италия към 5 ноември. През тази седмица до ECDC не са съобщени нови случаи и всички клъстери в момента са затворени. В най-отдалечените региони се наблюдават различни модели на предаване. Гваделупа остава в епидемична фаза 2, ниво 1, с изолирани огнища и доминиращ серотип DENV-3. Мартиника, Сент Мартен и Сент Бартелеми са в епидемична фаза 1 със спорадични случаи на по-ниски нива. Френска Гвиана е потвърдила девет случая на денга през 43–44-та седмица, с общо 293 случая от началото на годината, като 97% от типизираните проби са DENV-2. Майот е съобщил 30 случая до 8 септември без скорошни детекции. Реюнион има 44 случая от началото на годината, от които 17 потвърдени, като последният автохтонен случай е регистриран през 17-та седмица в края на април.\nГлобалният надзор върху чикунгуня отчита 458 840 случая и 146 смъртни изхода в 24 държави и територии през 2025 г. През октомври са регистрирани 44 295 нови случая, което представлява 108% увеличение спрямо 21 266-те случая през септември, но само с един свързан смъртен изход в сравнение с десет през септември. Регионът на Америка отчита 266 165 случая и 118 смъртни изхода, което е намаление с 35,2% спрямо същия период на 2024 г. Бразилия поддържа предаване във всички региони, като през последните епидемиологични седмици най-високите нива са в Центро–Оесте и Судесте, особено в щатите Мато Гросо до Сул, Минас Жерайс и Сао Пауло. Куба съобщава за взрив във всички 14 провинции, като намаляващите фебрилни синдроми показват контрол на епидемията. Боливия отчита случаи в шест от девет департамента, като департамент Санта Крус представлява над 80% от случаите и всички смъртни изходи, включително документирани случаи на синдром на Гилен–Баре, свързан с инфекция с чикунгуня.\nВ Азия 136 233 случая без свързани смъртни изходи представляват 31,5% намаление спрямо същия период на 2024 г., като най-силно засегната е Югоизточна Азия. В Китай взривът, продължаващ от първия случай през юли 2025 г., е концентриран в провинция Гуангдонг, особено в градовете Джиангмън, Фошан и Гуанджоу. Седмичният брой случаи показва намаляваща тенденция през 41–43-та седмица, въпреки че общият брой за октомври превишава този за септември. Случаи са съобщени и в Хонконг и провинция Гуанси, първоначално свързани с внесени случаи от Гуангдонг. В Пакистан, където се наблюдава целогодишно предаване, концентрирано в югозападните провинции, са регистрирани 109 случая през последните 60 дни без смъртни изходи, което представлява 37% увеличение през октомври в сравнение със септември. В Сингапур случаите, съобщени от началото на август, включват първоначално случаи при пътуващи от Гуангдонг, а предаването продължава през септември и октомври.\nЗа ЕС/ЕИП сезонният надзор върху чикунгуня отчита 776 случая във Франция и 384 в Италия към 12 ноември. През тази седмица Франция не е представила данни, като се очаква докладване през 47-ма седмица. Италия съобщава десет нови локално придобити случая, с което общият брой достига 384 случая, разпределени в шест клъстера, от които три са активни. Най-големият клъстер е разположен в Карпи, Сан Просперо, Солиера, Новелара, Кавецо, Модена, Нонантона, Кореджо, Нови ди Модена и Чезенатико в регион Емилия–Романя.\n\n\nФекално-орални инфекции\nНай-значимото глобално развитие през 46-та седмица се отнася до полиомиелита, като Германия съобщава за установяване на див полиовирус тип 1 в проба от отпадни води от Хамбург. Пробата е събрана през 41-та календарна седмица като част от изследователски проект за разработване на методология за детекция на полиовируси и представлява първото подобно откритие в страна, която запазва полио-свободен статус като част от Европейския регион на СЗО от 2002 г. Геномен анализ показва висока степен на сходство с генетичен клъстер, циркулиращ в Афганистан, където дивият полиовирус тип 1 продължава да циркулира заедно с Пакистан. В Германия не са регистрирани клинични случаи на полиомиелит, а Институтът „Роберт Кох“ подчертава, че рискът за общото население остава много нисък поради високия ваксинален обхват, приблизително 88% за три дози инактивирана полиовирусна ваксина.\nТова откритие, макар и необичайно, не е неочаквано, предвид продължаващата глобална циркулация на дивия полиовирус и наличието на недостатъчно имунизирани групи в някои европейски страни. Вирусът се предава основно по фекално-орален път, като инфектираните лица отделят вируса с фецес в продължение на няколко седмици, дори когато са асимптомни, което прави надзора върху отпадните води чувствителна система за ранно предупреждение. Повечето инфекции с полиовирус протичат без видими симптоми, приблизително 24% причиняват лек неспецифичен фебрилен синдром, а по-малко от 1% прогресират до паралитичен полиомиелит с характерна остра вяла парализа. Германските власти оценяват, че макар рискът за общото население да е много нисък, възникването на клиничен случай при неваксинирани лица не може напълно да се изключи. Това откритие следва предходни детекции на циркулиращ ваксинопроизводен полиовирус тип 2 в отпадни води в Германия от края на 2024 г., което подчертава значението на поддържането на висок ваксинален обхват и на устойчив надзор върху околната среда.\n\n\nКонтактно и сексуално предаване\nНадзорът върху mpox показва съществени развития в моделите на предаване през 46-та седмица, като 88 нови случая са съобщени в осем държави от ЕС/ЕИП от 9 октомври насам. Испания отчита 29 случая, следвана от Германия с 19, Португалия с 16, Франция с 12, Нидерландия с девет, а Гърция, Унгария и Норвегия – с по един случай. Кумулативното бреме от началото на взрива достига 25 609 потвърдени случая в 29 държави от ЕС/ЕИП, като Испания отчита 9 110 случая, Франция – 4 552, а Германия – 4 540. Десет смъртни изхода са съобщени от пет държави за целия период на взрива.\nПоявата на mpox клон I в Европа продължава с общо 50 случая, съобщени към 13 ноември, включително 46 случая, въведени в Европейската система за надзор, и още четири случая от Испания, идентифицирани чрез надзор, основан на събития. Германия съобщава 15 случая на клон I, докато Белгия и Нидерландия съобщават по седем случая. Разпределението включва Испания с шест случая, Ирландия и Италия с по четири случая, Франция с четири случая, както и Португалия, Гърция и Швеция с по един случай. Всички случаи са свързани с клон Ib, с изключение на първия случай в Ирландия, причинен от клон Ia.\nНай-значимото епидемиологично развитие се отнася до идентифицирането на 14 случая на mpox клон Ib сред мъже, които правят секс с мъже, като 12 от тези случаи нямат връзка с пътуване до държави с известна трансмисия на клон Ib. Нидерландия съобщава седем случая сред мъже, които правят секс с мъже, Испания – пет случая, Белгия – един, и Гърция – един. Случаите в Белгия и Гърция са внесени, но останалите случаи в Испания и Нидерландия са при лица без история на пътуване. Географското разпределение показва случаи в Мадрид и Барселона в Испания, докато нидерландските случаи са разпръснати в различни части на страната. Всички случаи сред мъжете, които правят секс с мъже, с изключение на гръцкия, имат начало на симптомите през октомври 2025 г., което говори за много скорошни събития на предаване.\nТези находки демонстрират продължаващо локално предаване на mpox клон I в рамките на сексуални мрежи на гей, бисексуални и други мъже, които правят секс с мъже в ЕС/ЕИП, което представлява значима промяна спрямо по-ранната фаза на взрива, когато всички случаи на клон I бяха внесени или пряко свързани с внесени инфекции с хетеросексуални и битови модели на предаване. Важно е, че нито един от случаите на mpox клон I сред мъжете, които правят секс с мъже, не изисква хоспитализация, а три случая са при ваксинирани лица, въпреки че данните за ефективността на ваксината срещу клон I остават ограничени. Общо седем лица са били хоспитализирани за лечение по време на взрива на клон I, всички от по-ранната фаза, свързана с хетеросексуално и битово предаване.\nЕпидемиологичният модел подсказва, че mpox клон I е установил вериги на предаване в европейските сексуални мрежи, независими от вносни случаи, свързани с пътуване. Това развитие доведе до публикуване на кратка оценка на заплахата от ECDC на 24 октомври, в която рискът от инфекция с MPXV клон Ib се оценява като умерен за мъжете, които правят секс с мъже, и нисък за общото население в ЕС/ЕИП. Оценката на риска като умерен за мъжете, които правят секс с мъже, отразява документално установеното локално предаване, докато остават значителни неясноти относно трансмисивността и тежестта на клон Ib в сравнение с клон IIb, който циркулира в Европа от 2022 г.\nПотвърдени вторични събития на предаване от внесени случаи на клон I са съобщени от Германия, Белгия и Ирландия сред членове на домакинството или други близки контакти, което показва, че вирусът запазва способността си да се предава и извън сексуални мрежи при наличие на тесен контакт. Наличието на предаване както в сексуални мрежи, така и в домакинствата подчертава необходимостта от комплексни мерки за обществено здраве, насочени към различни рискови групи и контексти на предаване."

    "text": "Инфекциозни заболявания: България\n\nВъздушно-капкови инфекции\nНадзорът в България през 46-та седмица документира значими увеличения при ваксинопредотвратими респираторни заболявания, съответстващи на есенно-зимните сезонни модели. Варицелата регистрира 420 случая, което представлява увеличение с 83 случая спрямо предходната седмица, или 24,6% относителен ръст, отразяващ характерната есенно-зимна сезонност на този силно заразен вирус. Разпределението на случаите включва 45 възможни, 305 вероятни и 70 потвърдени случая, като най-голям брой се наблюдава във Варна с 63 случая, а София-област и София-град съобщават по 60 случая. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 18 538 случая – представлява намаление с 20,3% спрямо 23 271-те случая за същия период на 2024 г., което предполага по-умерен сезонен ход в сравнение с предходната година. Варицелата засяга предимно деца, а характерният везикулозен обрив, появяващ се на „вълни“, формира типичната клинична картина. Въпреки че обикновено протича леко при здрави деца, заболяването може да предизвика тежки усложнения при имуносупресирани лица, бременни жени и възрастни, които не са преболедували в детството.\nСкарлатината показва значително увеличение с 84 случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява ръст с 34 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Разпределението на случаите включва 20 възможни, 33 вероятни и 31 потвърдени, като Пловдив отчита най-голям брой – 26 случая. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 3 060 случая – представлява драматично намаление с 60,7% спрямо 7 793 случая за същия период на 2024 г., продължавайки низходящата тенденция, характерна за цялата година. Скарлатината е резултат от фарингит, причинен от бета-хемолитичен стрептокок от група А, с продукция на еритрогенен токсин, който води до характерния „шкурковиден“ обрив, „ягодов“ език и периорален блед пръстен. Заболяването засяга предимно деца на 5–15-годишна възраст и обичайно протича леко при адекватно антибиотично лечение, но при липса на терапия може да доведе до сериозни усложнения като остър ревматичен пристъп и постстрептококов гломерулонефрит.\nНадзорът върху коклюш регистрира един потвърден случай през 46-та седмица, като общият брой от началото на годината достига 84 случая, което представлява намаление с 96,9% спрямо 2 678-те случая за същия период на 2024 г. Този драматичен спад вероятно отразява цикличния характер на епидемиите от коклюш, които обичайно се наблюдават на всеки три до пет години, като 2024 г. вероятно е била пикова година в голяма част от Европа. Коклюшът, причинен от Bordetella pertussis, води до характерни пароксизмални пристъпи на кашлица с инспираторен „whoop“ при класическите форми, въпреки че спектърът на проявите варира с възрастта, а при юноши и възрастни често се наблюдава продължителна кашлица без типичните белези. Най-голям риск заболяването представлява за кърмачета, които са твърде малки, за да бъдат напълно ваксинирани, при които могат да настъпят тежки усложнения като апнея, пневмония, гърчове и енцефалопатия.\nЕдин случай на морбили е съобщен от регион Перник през 46-та седмица. Както беше обсъдено в европейската секция, морбили остава предизвикателство в континента въпреки високото ваксинално покритие в повечето държави, като огнища възникват при въвеждане на вируса в общности с пропуски в имунитета. Изключително високата контагиозност на морбили, с базово репродуктивно число 12–18 в податливи популации, означава, че ваксиналното покритие трябва да надвишава 95%, за да се предотврати предаването на ниво общност. Изолираният случай в България подчертава важността на бърз отговор, включващ проследяване на контактните лица, проверка на ваксиналния статус и целеви кампании за ваксинация в засегнатите общности.\nНадзорът върху бактериалния менингит и менингоенцефалит регистрира един случай в регион Пловдив през 46-та седмица. Надзорната система обхваща менингити, причинени от различни бактериални патогени, включително Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae и други бактерии. Клиничната картина обичайно включва фебрилитет, главоболие, ригидност на врата и промяна в съзнанието с бърза прогресия за часове до дни. Незабавното започване на емпирична антибиотична терапия е от решаващо значение предвид високата смъртност и заболеваемост при закъсняло лечение. Относително ниският брой случаи отразява успеха на програмите за конюгирани ваксини, насочени към най-честите бактериални причинители на менингит в детска и възрастова възраст.\nНадзорът върху COVID-19 документира 121 потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с 41 случая спрямо предходната седмица или 25,3% относителен спад, подсказващ намаляващо предаване. Географското разпределение показва, че София-област регистрира най-голям брой с 29 случая, следвана от Пловдив с 11 и Варна с 4 случая. От началото на годината са регистрирани 2 774 случая, което представлява намаление с 81,2% спрямо 14 776-те случая за същия период на 2024 г. Тази тенденция отразява преход към ендемична циркулация с чувствително по-ниско бреме на заболяването в сравнение с годините на пандемията. Стабилността на показателите за тежко протичане предполага, че популационният имунитет, придобит чрез ваксинация и предишна инфекция, в комбинация с по-малко вирулентни циркулиращи варианти, е довел до намалена тежест на заболяването на популационно ниво.\n\n\nВекторно-преносими инфекции\nЛаймската борелиоза регистрира пет потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, при стабилни стойности спрямо предходната седмица. Случаите са разпределени в регионите Габрово, Ловеч, Стара Загора и Плевен, което отразява широкото географско разпространение на кърлежовите вектори в България. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 368 случая – е с четири случая повече в сравнение с 364-те за същия период на 2024 г., което предполага стабилна ендемична циркулация. Лаймската болест, причинена от комплекс Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato и предавана от кърлежи от род Ixodes, обичайно се проявява с еритема мигранс – патогномоничен разширяващ се червен обрив с централно избледняване. При липса на лечение инфекцията може да прогресира до ранен дисеминиран стадий с множествени кожни лезии, неврологични прояви като фациална парализа и менингит или сърдечни прояви. Късният стадий се характеризира с артрит, най-често на големи стави, или хронични неврологични симптоми. Заболяването се повлиява добре от антибиотична терапия при ранно разпознаване, което подчертава значението на клиничната бдителност.\nНадзорът върху болестта на легионерите регистрира един потвърден случай през 46-та седмица, което представлява увеличение с един случай спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 12 случая – е с два повече спрямо 10-те за същия период на 2024 г. Болестта на легионерите възниква при инхалация на аерозоли, съдържащи бактерии от род Legionella, най-често Legionella pneumophila, обичайно от контаминирани водни системи, включително охладителни кули, джакузи, декоративни фонтани и вътрешни водопроводни инсталации. Заболяването се проявява като тежка пневмония с висок фебрилитет, кашлица и системни симптоми, изискваща специфична антибиотична терапия. Екологичното проучване на потенциалните източници е важен елемент от управлението на всеки случай, за да се предотвратят допълнителни експозиции и да се идентифицират системи, нуждаещи се от ремедиация.\nКу-треската регистрира един потвърден случай през 46-та седмица в София-област, което представлява увеличение с един случай спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 37 случая – е с шест по-малко спрямо 43-те за същия период на 2024 г. Ку-треската, причинена от Coxiella burnetii, е зооноза, при която основни резервоари са говеда, овце и кози. Предаването обичайно настъпва при инхалация на аерозоли от контаминирана среда, особено по време на отелване, агнене и оагване на инфектирани животни, когато патогенът се отделя в големи количества в плацентарните тъкани и родилните секрети. Професионалната експозиция представлява най-важния рисков фактор, като фермери, ветеринарни лекари и работници в кланици са с повишен риск. Острата Ку-треска се проявява като фебрилно заболяване, което може да включва пневмония или хепатит, докато хроничната форма се проявява като ендокардит или съдови инфекции, особено при лица с предшестващо клапно заболяване или съдови аномалии.\n\n\nФекално-орални инфекции\nНадзорът върху гастроентерит и ентероколит документира 147 случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с 18 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Разпределението на случаите включва 47 възможни, 96 вероятни и четири потвърдени случая, като Пловдив съобщава 32 случая, Варна – 22, а Плевен – 10 случая. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 8 506 случая – представлява намаление с 5,9% спрямо 9 038-те случая за същия период на 2024 г. Тази широка надзорна категория обхваща гастроентерити с различна етиология, включително вирусни, бактериални и паразитни причинители. Преобладаването на вероятни случаи отразява синдромния характер на надзора, при който клиничните прояви са съвместими с гастроентерит, но специфично идентифициране на причинителя не винаги се извършва. Есенно-зимното увеличение на случаите съответства на сезонните модели, свързани с повишена циркулация на норовируси и ротавируси в по-студените месеци.\nРотавирусният гастроентерит регистрира 19 случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява увеличение с 11 случая спрямо предходната седмица. Разпределението на случаите включва един вероятен и 18 потвърдени случая, което демонстрира високия дял на лабораторно потвърдените диагнози при този патоген. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 668 случая – е с 39 случая по-малко спрямо 707-те за същия период на 2024 г. Ротавирусът остава водеща причина за тежък гастроентерит при деца под пет години в световен мащаб въпреки наличието на ваксини. Вирусът причинява обилна водниста диария, повръщане и фебрилитет, като дехидратацията е основното усложнение, изискващо медицинска намеса. Сезонното увеличение през есенно-зимните месеци отразява оптимални условия за предаване и повишен контакт между децата в закрити пространства.\nСалмонелозата регистрира четири потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с два случая спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 622 случая – е с 28,8% по-малък спрямо 874-те за същия период на 2024 г. Бактериите от род Salmonella причиняват гастроентерит чрез консумация на контаминирани храни, особено птичи продукти, яйца и непастьоризирани млечни продукти, макар широк спектър от храни да могат да служат като вектори. Инфекцията обичайно се проявява с диария, фебрилитет и абдоминални болки 12–72 часа след експозиция, като при повечето хора заболяването продължава 4–7 дни. Макар че повечето случаи се възстановяват без специфично лечение, инвазивно заболяване може да настъпи, особено при малки деца, възрастни и имуносупресирани лица.\nДизентерията, по-специално шигелозата, регистрира два потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица в региони Добрич и Кюстендил, което представлява увеличение с един случай спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 53 случая – е с 22 по-малко спрямо 75-те за същия период на 2024 г. Бактериите от род Shigella причиняват дизентерия, характеризираща се с диария с примес на кръв и слуз, абдоминални крампи, фебрилитет и тенезми. Инфекцията се предава по фекално-орален път с много ниска инфекциозна доза, което прави възможно лесно предаване от човек на човек, особено в условия на недостатъчна хигиена на ръцете. Шигелозата представлява важна причина за вътреболнична диария и огнища в институционални среди.\nКампилобактериозата регистрира 14 потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява увеличение с пет случая спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 421 случая – показва значително увеличение с 43,7% спрямо 293-те за същия период на 2024 г. София-област съобщава мнозинството от случаите с десет. Бактериите от род Campylobacter, особено Campylobacter jejuni, са най-честата бактериална причина за гастроентерит в много развити страни. Инфекцията обичайно е свързана с консумация на недобре термично обработено птиче месо или кръстосано контаминиране от сурово птиче месо към други храни, както и с консумация на непастьоризирано мляко. Заболяването се проявява с диария, която може да бъде кървава, фебрилитет и абдоминална болка, обичайно с продължителност под една седмица. След инфекция могат да възникнат постинфекциозни усложнения като реактивен артрит и, макар и рядко, синдром на Гилен–Баре.\nИнфекциите с Escherichia coli, причиняващи колит, по-специално ешерихиозите, регистрират четири потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с четири случая спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 287 случая – е по-нисък спрямо 328-те за същия период на 2024 г. Различни патотипове на E. coli причиняват гастроинтестинално заболяване чрез различни механизми, включително ентеропатогенни, ентеротоксигенни, ентероинвазивни, ентероагрегативни и ентерохеморагични щамове. Клиничните прояви варират от водниста диария до кръвна диария в зависимост от патотипа. Ентерохеморагичната E. coli, особено серотип O157:H7, представлява особено притеснение поради риска от хемолитико-уремичен синдром, тежко усложнение, причиняващо остра бъбречна увреда.\n\n\nПолово предавани инфекции\nНадзорът върху сифилиса регистрира 14 случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява увеличение с девет случая спрямо предходната седмица. Разпределението включва един вероятен и 13 потвърдени случая. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 323 случая – показва увеличение с 9,9% спрямо 294-те за същия период на 2024 г. Сифилисът, причинен от спирохетата Treponema pallidum, има сложни клинични прояви, които при липса на лечение прогресират през различни стадии. Първичният сифилис се характеризира с безболезнена язва (шанкър) на мястото на инокулацията, докато вторичният сифилис причинява системни симптоми, включително обрив, лимфаденопатия и мукокутанни лезии. Латентният стадий протича безсимптомно при персистираща инфекция, а третичният сифилис може да засегне множество органи, включително сърдечно-съдовата и централната нервна система. Заболяването се повлиява добре от терапия с пеницилин, а програмите за скрининг, насочени към сексуално активни лица, позволяват ранно откриване и лечение.\nВроденият и ранно-детски сифилис регистрира един потвърден случай през 46-та седмица, което представлява увеличение с един случай спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 34 случая – показва тревожно увеличение с 183% спрямо 12-те за същия период на 2024 г. Вроденият сифилис възниква при трансплацентарно предаване на Treponema pallidum от инфектирана майка на плода, като рискът от предаване е най-голям при майчин първичен и вторичен сифилис, но е налице и при латентна инфекция. Вроденият сифилис може да доведе до вътреутробна смърт, мъртвораждане, преждевременно раждане и широк спектър от клинични прояви при живородени, включително костни аномалии, хепатоспленомегалия, обрив и невросифилис. Значителното увеличение на случаите на вроден сифилис сигнализира за пропуски в системата на пренаталната грижа, тъй като универсалният скрининг по време на бременност, комбиниран с своевременно лечение на инфектираните жени, предотвратява вертикалното предаване. Тази находка изисква спешно обществено здравно разследване за идентифициране на пропуски в пренаталния скрининг, затруднения в достъпа до грижи или неуспех в лечението на сексуални партньори, които поддържат майчината инфекция.\nУрогениталната инфекция с хламидия регистрира два потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с четири случая спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 169 случая – показва увеличение с 79,8% спрямо 94-те за същия период на 2024 г. Chlamydia trachomatis причинява най-разпространената бактериална полово предавана инфекция в световен мащаб, като повечето инфекции протичат безсимптомно, особено при жените. При симптоматичните случаи инфекцията причинява уретрит при мъжете и цервицит при жените, а усложненията включват възпалителна болест на малкия таз, извънматочна бременност и инфертилитет при жените и епидидимит при мъжете. Асимптомният ход при значителен дял от инфекциите подчертава значението на програмите за скрининг, насочени към сексуално активни млади хора, за да се осигури откриване и лечение преди поява на усложнения.\nГонореята регистрира два потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, със стабилни стойности спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 107 случая – представлява увеличение с 28,9% спрямо 83-те за същия период на 2024 г. Neisseria gonorrhoeae причинява уретрит при мъжете и цервицит при жените, въпреки че, подобно на хламидията, много инфекции протичат безсимптомно, особено при жените. Усложненията включват възпалителна болест на малкия таз при жените и епидидимит при мъжете, а дисеминираната гонококова инфекция може да доведе до артрит и дерматит. Нарастващата глобална честота на антимикробно-резистентна гонорея представлява сериозен проблем за общественото здраве, като е документирана резистентност към пеницилини, тетрациклини, флуорохинолони и макролиди и се съобщава за поява на резистентност и към цефалоспорини с разширен спектър.\nНадзорът върху HIV регистрира пет потвърдени случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с три случая спрямо предходната седмица. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 272 случая – показва увеличение с 9,7% спрямо 248-те за същия период на 2024 г. HIV инфекцията прогресира през различни стадии – от остър стадий с високи вирусни натоварвания, през хроничен стадий с устойчиво, но по-ниско вирусно натоварване, до напреднало HIV заболяване, характеризиращо се с тежка имунна недостатъчност и възможност за опортюнистични инфекции. Антиретровирусната терапия преобрази HIV от бързо фатално заболяване в контролирано хронично състояние, като ранното започване на лечение позволява продължителност на живота, доближаваща се до тази на неинфектираните лица. Лечението служи и като превенция, тъй като лица с потиснат вирусен товар при ефективна терапия не предават вируса по сексуален път. Продължаващото регистриране на нови инфекции подчертава значението на профилактични програми, включително предекспозиционна профилактика при лица с висок риск, постекспозиционна профилактика след възможни експозиции и комплексни услуги за сексуално здраве.\n\n\nВирусни хепатити\nОстрите вирусни хепатити A, B, C, D и E регистрират общо 39 случая през 46-та седмица, което представлява намаление с три случая спрямо предходната седмица. Разпределението на случаите включва четири възможни, девет вероятни и 26 потвърдени случая. Кумулативният брой от началото на годината – 1 317 случая – показва значително увеличение със 112,8% спрямо 619-те за същия период на 2024 г. Този рязък ръст изисква внимателно епидемиологично проучване за характеризиране на етиологиите, идентифициране на моделите на предаване и прилагане на целенасочени мерки за контрол. Надзорната категория обхваща хепатитните вируси A, B, C, D и E, които се различават съществено по пътища на предаване, естествен ход и стратегии за превенция. Хепатит A и E се предават по фекално-орален път, хепатит B и C – по кръвен и сексуален път, а хепатит D изисква коинфекция с хепатит B. Удвояването на случая предполага или повишено предаване на един или повече хепатитни вируси, или промени в поведението при търсене на медицинска помощ и в практиките за диагностика, водещи до увеличено откриване."

    "text": "Non-Communicable Disease Developments\n\nPharmacovigilance and Medicinal Product Safety\nThe European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee convened its monthly meeting from 24-27 November 2025 in Amsterdam to evaluate the safety profiles of numerous medicinal products authorized in the European Union. This routine but essential activity represents a critical component of the post-authorization surveillance system that protects public health by continuously monitoring the benefit-risk balance of medicines throughout their lifecycle.\nThe PRAC agenda for this meeting included evaluation of multiple periodic safety update reports (PSURs) for centrally authorized products spanning diverse therapeutic areas. Among the products under review were several high-profile medicines that have been subjects of intensive pharmacovigilance scrutiny. Notably, the Committee evaluated safety data for COVID-19 vaccines, including Kostaive, which submitted updates based on final results from study ARCT-2303-01, a Phase 3 observer-blind, randomized controlled study evaluating the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the vaccine when administered concomitantly with quadrivalent influenza vaccines in adults.\nSeveral oncology products received attention during this meeting cycle. The PRAC reviewed signal assessments for axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy used in treating certain B-cell malignancies. A new signal of increased risk of brain edema specifically in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) patients was evaluated, reflecting the ongoing refinement of safety knowledge for these complex cellular therapies that have revolutionized cancer treatment but carry unique and serious adverse event profiles. The Committee also assessed a signal of cardiotoxicity associated with venlafaxine, a widely used antidepressant, and a signal of congenital megacolon following maternal exposure to ponatinib (Iclusig) during pregnancy, both of which could have important implications for prescribing practices if confirmed.\nRisk management plan evaluations formed another substantial component of the meeting, with 15 pre-authorization products undergoing assessment. These included treatments for diverse conditions ranging from African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) with acoziborole to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with aficamten, and from Parkinson’s disease with a levodopa/carbidopa combination to WHIM syndrome with mavorixafor. The breadth of therapeutic areas represented underscores the continuous innovation in pharmaceutical development while highlighting the regulatory responsibility to ensure that new medicines entering the market have appropriate risk mitigation measures in place.\nPost-authorization safety studies (PASS) constituted a significant portion of the Committee’s workload, with both imposed and non-imposed studies under review. Imposed PASS protocols were evaluated for lecanemab (Leqembi), an Alzheimer’s disease treatment requiring real-world safety monitoring, and obecabtagene autoleucel (Aucatzyl), another CAR T-cell therapy. These imposed studies reflect regulatory requirements placed on marketing authorization holders when residual uncertainties about safety require systematic post-marketing investigation.\nThe Committee also reviewed interim and final reports from numerous ongoing post-authorization studies. Notably, several studies focused on the long-term safety of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) such as ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) for multiple myeloma and dinutuximab beta (Qarziba) for high-risk neuroblastoma, reflecting the particular importance of extended safety follow-up for these innovative but complex biological therapies whose long-term effects may not be fully characterized during pre-marketing clinical trials.\n\n\nInfant Botulism Outbreak Associated with Contaminated Infant Formula\nA multistate outbreak of infant botulism in the United States emerged as a significant food safety concern in November 2025, linked to contaminated ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. As of 19 November 2025, infant botulism was confirmed or suspected in 31 infants across 15 states. All affected infants required hospitalization, though no deaths have been reported. Illness onset dates ranged from 9 August to 13 November 2025, indicating that the contamination problem may have persisted for several months before detection and that the outbreak was identified through astute clinical recognition and public health surveillance rather than through routine product testing.\nInfant botulism represents a distinct form of botulism that occurs when infants ingest Clostridium botulinum spores, which then germinate, colonize the intestinal tract, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. This differs from foodborne botulism in older children and adults, where preformed toxin in contaminated food is ingested. Infants are uniquely susceptible to this colonization form of botulism because their intestinal microbiota are not yet fully developed, allowing C. botulinum spores to germinate and produce toxin within the gut. The disease typically affects infants under one year of age, with peak incidence between two and six months of age.\nClinical presentation of infant botulism characteristically begins with constipation, followed by progressive bilateral descending paralysis. Affected infants may present with lethargy, weak cry, poor feeding, decreased gag reflex, ptosis, and dilated pupils. The paralysis can progress to involve respiratory muscles, necessitating mechanical ventilation in severe cases. The diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion, as early symptoms can be subtle and nonspecific. Confirmation typically involves detection of botulinum toxin and/or C. botulinum organisms in infant stool specimens, though toxin may not always be detectable even in confirmed cases.\nPreliminary testing by the California Department of Public Health detected botulinum neurotoxin type A in an open can of ByHeart powdered infant formula (lot 206VABP/251131P2) that had been fed to an infant with laboratory-confirmed infant botulism. Subsequent testing confirmed the presence of Clostridium botulinum through culture. The detection of C. botulinum in infant formula represents a serious quality control failure, as powdered infant formula production processes should prevent such contamination. However, as noted by investigators, detection of C. botulinum in infant formula can be technically challenging, and a negative test result does not definitively rule out the presence of the bacterium, particularly given the low infectious dose (as few as 10-100 spores may be sufficient to cause disease in susceptible infants).\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched a comprehensive investigation in collaboration with state and local health authorities. FDA inspections and sampling of unopened product containers continued as of late November, with investigations aimed at determining the source of contamination within the production process. All lots and sizes of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, including both cans and single-serve packets, have been recalled and withdrawn from stores and online retailers. Products were also sold online to international customers, raising concerns about exposure beyond the United States.\nFrom a European perspective, the risk assessment conducted by ECDC concluded that based on currently available information, the product is not known to be sold on the European market through official distribution channels. However, the possibility of individual consumers having purchased the product through online platforms cannot be entirely excluded. Consequently, the risk in the EU/EEA of infant botulism associated with this product is considered restricted to individual consumers who may have bought the product online. Control measures implemented in the United States and by major online platforms should significantly reduce the likelihood of continued exposure to contaminated products, though complete elimination of risk requires ongoing vigilance.\nThis outbreak highlights several important public health principles. First, it demonstrates the critical importance of robust food safety systems and quality control in infant formula production, given the particular vulnerability of this population. Second, it underscores the value of clinical acumen and disease surveillance systems in detecting outbreaks, as this event was identified through recognition of a cluster of cases rather than through routine product testing. Third, it illustrates the challenges of controlling distribution of contaminated products in the era of global e-commerce, where products recalled in one jurisdiction may still be accessible to consumers elsewhere through online purchasing. Finally, it emphasizes the need for international coordination and information sharing in food safety incidents with potential cross-border implications."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Global Perspective\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nInfluenza A(H5N1) - Continued Spillover from Avian Reservoirs\nGlobal surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza continues to document sporadic human cases resulting from direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. On 16 November 2025, Cambodia reported a fatal human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in an adult man from Chroy Changvar District in the autonomous municipality of Phnom Penh. The patient developed symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. Despite receiving medical care, he succumbed to the infection on 15 November 2025, the same day that the National Institute of Public Health confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) through laboratory testing.\nThis case represents Cambodia’s 18th human A(H5N1) infection in 2025, bringing the country’s cumulative total since the disease first emerged there to 90 cases, including 52 deaths, yielding a case fatality rate of 58%. This extraordinarily high case fatality rate reflects both the inherent virulence of A(H5N1) viruses in humans and potential ascertainment bias, as mild or subclinical infections are less likely to come to medical attention and be diagnosed. Cambodia’s continued experience with human A(H5N1) cases reflects persistent circulation of the virus in poultry populations and ongoing human-avian interfaces that create opportunities for zoonotic transmission.\nThe clinical presentation described for the Cambodian case is consistent with the typical progression of severe A(H5N1) infection in humans. Following an incubation period typically ranging from two to five days (though occasionally longer), patients usually present with high fever and respiratory symptoms. Unlike seasonal influenza, which primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, avian influenza A(H5N1) has tropism for lower respiratory epithelium, leading to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Many patients develop multi-organ failure, including hepatic dysfunction, renal impairment, and encephalopathy. The rapid progression from symptom onset to critical illness and death is characteristic of severe A(H5N1) infections.\nVirological surveillance indicates that circulating A(H5N1) viruses retain genetic characteristics consistent with avian-adapted influenza viruses, lacking most of the specific mutations known to facilitate efficient mammalian adaptation and human-to-human transmission. This is a critical observation from a pandemic preparedness perspective. The key barriers to pandemic emergence include inefficient transmission from birds to humans (requiring direct contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments), lack of sustained human-to-human transmission, and retention of receptor-binding preferences for avian-type receptors rather than human-type receptors in the respiratory tract.\nDespite these reassuring virological features, the persistent global circulation of A(H5N1) in poultry and wild birds, combined with the virus’s demonstrated ability to cause severe and often fatal disease in humans, necessitates continued vigilance. Each human infection represents not only a personal tragedy but also an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian hosts. While the risk of a specific human case leading to pandemic emergence remains very low, the cumulative risk over time and across multiple exposures cannot be dismissed.\nNational and local authorities in Cambodia are implementing response measures including active contact tracing, antiviral prophylaxis (Tamiflu) for close contacts of the case, and health education campaigns in affected villages. These interventions aim to identify any potential secondary cases quickly (which would represent a worrying signal of improving human-to-human transmission capability) and to reduce further zoonotic exposures through behavior change.\nSince 2003, when enhanced global surveillance for human A(H5N1) infections began, a cumulative total of 993 confirmed human cases have been reported worldwide as of 17 November 2025, including 476 deaths, yielding an overall case fatality rate of 48%. These cases have been reported from 25 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America, though the geographic distribution is highly skewed, with most cases occurring in Egypt, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The absence of sustained human-to-human transmission across this 22-year surveillance period, despite nearly 1,000 human infections, provides some reassurance that the genetic barriers to pandemic emergence are substantial. However, it also underscores that these barriers are not absolute, and continued spillover events maintain pandemic risk.\n\n\nInfluenza A(H5N5) - First Human Case Globally\nOn 14 November 2025, the Washington State Department of Health reported the first confirmed human infection globally with avian influenza A(H5N5) virus. This novel finding represents an important development in avian influenza surveillance and underscores the ongoing spillover risk from diverse avian influenza subtypes circulating in wild bird and poultry populations.\nThe case involved an older adult resident of Grays Harbor County, Washington, with underlying health conditions. The patient was hospitalized in early November 2025 and remained under medical care at the time of reporting. Epidemiological investigation identified the likely source of exposure as a mixed backyard flock of domestic poultry that had contact with wild birds. This exposure pattern is typical for avian influenza spillover events, where the interface between wild bird reservoirs, domestic poultry, and humans creates opportunities for zoonotic transmission. Backyard poultry production, while often undertaken for personal food security or hobby purposes, can create biosecurity vulnerabilities when birds have outdoor access and potential contact with wild bird populations.\nThe genetic characterization of the virus isolated from this case provided important virological insights. Sequencing revealed that the isolate (designated A/Washington/2148/2025) belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype A6, which has been commonly reported for recent A(H5N5) detections in birds and mammals in North America. In European nomenclature, this genotype is referred to as EA-2021-I. The hemagglutinin (HA) segment of the virus clusters closely with other clade 2.3.4.4b strains of the same subtype but is distinct from the A(H5N1) genotypes B3.13 and D1.1 that include strains associated with recent human infections in the United States related to the dairy cattle outbreak.\nCritically, the A/Washington/2148/2025 virus does not contain key mutations associated with mammalian adaptation of pandemic concern. Specifically, the virus lacks markers in the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) segment that have been associated with enhanced replication in mammalian hosts. Some European A(H5N5) viruses belonging to genotype EA-2021-I detected in 2025 have contained PB2-E627K or PB2-E627V substitutions, both of which are recognized as mammalian adaptation markers that can enhance virulence and replication efficiency in mammals. However, these concerning markers were absent from the Washington isolate, suggesting this particular virus retains characteristics of an avian-adapted virus with limited mammalian adaptation.\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N5) of clade 2.3.4.4b has been circulating in wild birds in northern Europe and North America, with the geographic and species range expanding in recent years. The virus has caused spillover infections to wild mammals, domestic birds, and occasionally domestic cats, demonstrating its ability to cross species barriers under appropriate exposure conditions. In Europe during the 2024-2025 epidemiological year, seven EU/EEA countries (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) reported detections of HPAI A(H5N5) in wild birds, while Iceland and Norway also reported outbreaks in domestic poultry flocks.\nDetections in wild mammals have included Arctic and red foxes, lynx, otters, American mink, bobcats, skunks, grey seals, raccoons, and pine martens across Iceland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Canada. The detection in domestic cats in Iceland is particularly noteworthy, as cats can serve as sentinel species for environmental contamination with avian influenza viruses and can potentially transmit infection to humans through close contact, though such transmission appears to be rare.\nIn North America, Canada reported eight detections of HPAI A(H5N5) in wild birds and one outbreak in domestic poultry during the past epidemiological year, along with detections in the wild mammals noted above. The United States has documented 11 detections in wild birds since the beginning of 2025 according to USDA reports. This widespread circulation in wild bird populations creates ongoing spillover risk to both animals and humans with appropriate exposures.\nFrom a pandemic risk assessment perspective, the first human case of A(H5N5) warrants careful monitoring but does not fundamentally alter the overall assessment of risk from avian influenza viruses. The U.S. CDC maintains its assessment that the risk of avian influenza A(H5) to the general public remains low. This assessment is based on several factors: the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission of any avian influenza A(H5) subtype despite decades of surveillance, the requirement for direct contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments for human infection to occur, and the virological characteristics of circulating viruses that remain primarily adapted to avian hosts.\nHowever, the detection of this first human A(H5N5) case globally does highlight several important points. First, it demonstrates that multiple subtypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza (not just A(H5N1)) pose zoonotic risk to humans with appropriate exposures. Second, it underscores the importance of biosecurity measures for backyard poultry producers, including preventing contact between domestic birds and wild birds, using personal protective equipment when handling birds or cleaning coops, and promptly reporting sick or dead birds to veterinary authorities. Third, it emphasizes the need for continued surveillance and characterization of avian influenza viruses in both animal and human populations to detect emerging variants of concern rapidly.\nFor the European context, where A(H5N5) viruses have been circulating in wild birds and causing occasional mammalian spillovers, this first human case serves as a reminder that the spillover risk applies across regions where the virus is present. Healthcare providers in areas with documented A(H5N5) circulation should maintain awareness of avian influenza as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe respiratory illness who have recent exposure to poultry or wild birds. Early recognition and appropriate infection control measures can prevent nosocomial transmission, which has occurred rarely with avian influenza but represents a potential risk in healthcare settings.\n\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\n\nRift Valley Fever - West African Multi-Country Outbreak\nWest Africa is experiencing a significant multi-country outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) affecting human and animal populations in Senegal, Mauritania, and The Gambia. This outbreak, which emerged in late September 2025, represents an important public health event given RVF’s potential for severe disease in humans, its impact on livestock economies, and the risk of geographic expansion.\nRift Valley fever is an acute viral disease caused by RVF virus, a member of the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. The virus is primarily maintained in nature through a complex transmission cycle involving Aedes mosquito species and various vertebrate hosts, particularly domestic ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The disease derives its name from the Rift Valley of Kenya where it was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epizootic among sheep. While endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, the disease has demonstrated capacity for expansion, with major outbreaks documented in Egypt (1977-78), Saudi Arabia and Yemen (2000), and more recently in Madagascar and other locations.\nAs of 20 November 2025, Senegal has reported 482 human cases including 31 deaths, yielding a case fatality rate of 6.4%. The outbreak began on 21 September 2025, with 419 patients having recovered and one person hospitalized at the time of reporting. According to Africa CDC, most cases occurred in males, and the most affected age group is individuals aged 15-35 years, likely reflecting occupational exposure patterns related to livestock husbandry and slaughtering activities. The geographic distribution spans 11 regions: Saint-Louis (344 cases), Louga (21), Matam (34), Fatick (32), Dakar (13), Kaolack (24), Thiès (2), Tambacounda (5), Kèdougou (2), Kaffrine (2), and Kolda (1). Many of these affected regions are in the northern part of the country, particularly around the Senegal River valley and delta, bordering Mauritania. Notably, cases have recently begun spreading to southern parts of the country, raising concerns about potential cross-border transmission to The Gambia, Mali, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau.\nThe livestock component of the outbreak in Senegal has been substantial, with 390 cases reported among animals and 1,997 animal abortions documented. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) reported on 30 September 2025 that the area is at high risk for outbreaks in domestic and wild animals during the winter period, citing notable previous outbreaks in 2013 and 2023. As of 20 November, 29,980 animals have been vaccinated as part of outbreak control efforts. The occurrence of widespread abortion storms in livestock is characteristic of RVF epizootics and often precedes or accompanies human cases, as abortions generate infectious materials that create exposure opportunities for herders, veterinarians, and those handling carcasses.\nMauritania reported its first human cases of this outbreak on 2 October 2025. As of 9 November 2025, the country has documented 52 human cases and 15 deaths, yielding a substantially higher case fatality rate of 28.8% compared to Senegal. The 13 affected regions are concentrated in the southern part of the country near the border with Senegal, with three regions sharing international borders: Assaba (bordering Mali to the south), and Brakna and Trarza (both bordering Senegal along the Senegal River). According to WHO reporting, as of 30 October 2025, there have been 235 confirmed cases and 71 deaths among animals in southern Mauritania since the first outbreak was recorded on 15 September 2025.\nThe Gambia reported its first human case of RVF on 5 November 2025, according to media reports citing health officials. The case occurred in the Senegalese border village of Ker Ayib. On 28 October 2025, WOAH reported four cases in livestock in The Gambia, confirming the presence of the virus in the country’s animal populations.\nThe concentration of both human and animal cases around the Senegal River delta and valley is epidemiologically significant. The early autumn months are considered a high-risk period for RVF in this region due to climatic and ecological factors that favor mosquito breeding and viral transmission. Heavy rainfall creates extensive temporary pools and flooded areas that serve as mosquito breeding sites, particularly for Aedes species that can serve as both biological and mechanical vectors for RVF virus. Additionally, the movement of livestock in search of grazing and water during seasonal transhumance patterns may facilitate geographic spread of the virus.\nGenomic analysis of viruses from the current outbreak suggests linkage to previous RVF detections in Senegal (Fatick in 2020 and Matam in 2022) and in Mauritania (2020), indicating that the virus has been circulating at low levels in the region for several years and has now emerged in epidemic form under favorable conditions. This pattern of endemic maintenance with periodic epidemic emergence is characteristic of RVF epidemiology in endemic regions.\nHuman infection with RVF virus occurs through multiple exposure routes. Direct contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals during slaughtering, butchering, or assisting with animal births is the most common route, particularly for adults with occupational exposure. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat or unpasteurized milk from infected animals can also result in transmission, though this is less common. Mosquito-borne transmission can occur but is believed to play a smaller role in human infection compared to direct animal contact. Human-to-human transmission has not been documented, though theoretical risk exists through contact with blood or body fluids of severely ill patients, particularly in healthcare settings.\nThe clinical spectrum of RVF in humans ranges from asymptomatic or mild febrile illness to severe disease with potentially fatal complications. Most infected individuals experience a relatively mild illness characterized by abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, with spontaneous recovery occurring within a few days to a week. However, a small percentage of patients (estimated at 1-2%) develop much more severe forms of disease. These severe manifestations include ocular disease (retinitis that can lead to permanent vision loss), hemorrhagic fever (with hepatitis, hemorrhagic diathesis, and multi-organ failure), and encephalitis. The case fatality rate among patients developing hemorrhagic manifestations can exceed 50%, accounting for the overall case fatality rates observed in this outbreak.\nFrom a European public health perspective, ECDC’s risk assessment concludes that travelers to and residents of Senegal or Mauritania are at low risk of infection if they apply appropriate preventive measures. Those in contact with potentially infected animals (veterinarians, livestock farmers, abattoir workers, and those involved in butchering and slaughtering in RVF-affected areas) face increased risk and should ensure safe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices, including use of personal protective equipment. Visitors to affected areas should apply personal protective measures against mosquito bites, including use of repellents, protective clothing, and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity periods.\nThe likelihood of RVF virus being introduced into EU/EEA countries is assessed as very low, as importation of live ruminants and raw animal products from affected countries is not permitted under EU veterinary regulations. Importation via travelers is also unlikely, though not impossible, as most human cases resolve quickly and viremia is typically short-lived. The potential for introduction via infected mosquitoes in aircraft or other conveyances is theoretically possible but extremely rare and has not been documented for RVF.\nShould the virus be introduced into mainland EU/EEA countries, further vector-borne transmission among animals or humans cannot be excluded but is considered to have very low likelihood during the late autumn and winter season due to low numbers of competent mosquito vectors and low levels of vector activity. The establishment of RVF in European mosquito and livestock populations would require specific conditions that are not currently present.\nTransmission of RVF virus through substances of human origin (blood, tissues, organs) has not been reported to date, but the possibility cannot be excluded entirely. However, given that both Senegal, Mauritania, and The Gambia are countries endemic for malaria, the standard deferral period for blood donors returning from malaria-endemic areas would effectively mitigate any potential risk of RVF virus transmission through transfusion, as the deferral period exceeds the typical duration of RVF viremia.\nThis multi-country outbreak highlights several important principles in emerging infectious disease management. First, it demonstrates the interconnection between animal and human health (the One Health paradigm), as the outbreak in livestock populations directly drives human cases. Effective outbreak control therefore requires coordinated veterinary and public health responses, including animal vaccination campaigns, safe livestock handling practices, and mosquito control measures. Second, it underscores the importance of cross-border collaboration and information sharing in outbreak response, as the affected countries share porous borders, common ecosystems, and transboundary animal movement patterns. Third, it illustrates how climatic and ecological factors can precipitate emergence of previously endemic pathogens into epidemic form, a pattern likely to become increasingly common with ongoing environmental change.\n\n\nWest Nile Virus - European Season Concluding\nThe 2025 West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season in Europe is winding down as temperatures decrease and vector activity declines with the approach of winter. Since the beginning of 2025 and as of 19 November 2025, 14 countries in Europe have reported human cases of West Nile virus infection: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and Türkiye. A total of 156 areas are currently known to be affected, reflecting the widespread distribution of WNV circulation across southern and central Europe during the 2025 transmission season.\nWest Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus maintained in nature through transmission cycles involving Culex mosquito vectors and avian reservoir hosts, particularly corvids and other passerine birds. The virus was historically endemic to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia but has expanded its geographic range dramatically over recent decades, with establishment in southern Europe in the 1990s and introduction to North America in 1999. European WNV transmission typically occurs during the warmer months (roughly June through November) when mosquito populations are active, with peak transmission often observed in August and September.\nMost human WNV infections (approximately 80%) are asymptomatic. Among those who develop symptoms, the majority experience West Nile fever, a self-limited febrile illness characterized by abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgia, sometimes with rash, lymphadenopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms. This uncomplicated form typically resolves within a few days to weeks without specific treatment. However, approximately 1% of infected individuals develop neuroinvasive disease, which can manifest as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. Neuroinvasive WNV disease carries significant morbidity and mortality, with case fatality rates ranging from 3-15%, and long-term neurological sequelae common among survivors.\nRisk factors for neuroinvasive disease include advanced age (particularly over 60 years), immunosuppression, and certain chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal disease. The pathogenesis of neuroinvasive disease involves viral invasion of the central nervous system, likely through hematogenous dissemination followed by crossing of the blood-brain barrier, though the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood.\nNo specific antiviral therapy exists for WNV infection, and management is supportive, focusing on maintenance of hydration, management of neurological complications, and prevention of secondary complications. Similarly, no vaccine is licensed for human use (though equine vaccines exist), making prevention of mosquito exposure the primary intervention available. Public health measures during WNV transmission seasons include mosquito control activities (larviciding and adulticiding in some jurisdictions), public education campaigns about mosquito avoidance, and surveillance systems to detect viral circulation in mosquitoes, birds, and humans.\nThe seasonal pattern of WNV transmission means that as November progresses and winter approaches in Europe, new human cases become increasingly unlikely due to reduced mosquito activity and cessation of outdoor human-mosquito contact. The surveillance data reported for week 47 therefore likely represent late-season cases or delayed reporting of earlier infections rather than indication of ongoing high-level transmission. However, given climate variability and the potential for extended periods of warm weather, surveillance authorities maintain vigilance throughout the traditional risk period.\nFrom a public health perspective, the 2025 WNV season in Europe appears to have followed patterns generally consistent with recent years, though detailed comparative analysis would require review of weekly surveillance trends throughout the season. The geographic distribution encompassing 14 countries across southeastern, central, and southern Europe reflects the established distribution of WNV in the region and the widespread presence of competent Culex mosquito vectors. The involvement of 156 specific affected areas indicates localized transmission in multiple regions rather than a few major outbreak epicenters.\nAs the season concludes, public health priorities shift from immediate case detection and mosquito control to post-season analysis and preparation for subsequent transmission years. This includes characterization of circulating viral lineages through genomic sequencing, assessment of intervention effectiveness, identification of new geographic areas of transmission, and evaluation of surveillance system performance. These activities inform risk assessments and preparedness planning for the following year’s transmission season.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nInfant Botulism - United States Multistate Outbreak\n[This section was covered in detail under Non-Communicable Disease Developments due to its product safety aspects, but the outbreak also merits attention as an infectious disease event characterized by fecal-oral transmission of Clostridium botulinum spores. The key points regarding transmission, pathogenesis, clinical features, and public health response are as detailed in that earlier section.]\n\n\n\nContact and Healthcare-Associated Transmission\n\nMarburg Virus Disease - Ethiopia’s First Outbreak\nEthiopia is experiencing its first documented outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever with epidemic potential. The outbreak was officially confirmed on 14 November 2025 by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, following investigation of a suspected event that began in Jinka city on 12 November 2025. As of 20 November 2025, six confirmed cases of MVD have been reported, with a total of six deaths—three among laboratory-confirmed cases and three among suspected cases. Media reports indicate that the deaths include two healthcare workers, highlighting the nosocomial transmission risk that characterizes filovirus outbreaks. Three cases are being treated, and 33 suspected cases are under investigation.\nAs of 17 November 2025, 129 contacts were being monitored according to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health’s press release. Cases have presented with characteristic symptoms including sudden fever, muscle pain, severe fatigue, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and in later stages, unexplained bleeding manifestations. Jinka, the epicenter of this outbreak, is a small market town of approximately 30,000 inhabitants located in southwestern Ethiopia, close to the borders with South Sudan and Kenya. It serves as the capital of South Omo region and functions as a tourist hub for the area, though it is approximately two days’ travel from Addis Ababa. A small airport recently inaugurated in Jinka may facilitate both response efforts and potentially raise concerns about risk of disease exportation, though the latter risk remains very low given the clinical severity of MVD and the limited mobility of severely ill patients.\nMarburg virus disease is caused by Marburg marburgvirus (MARV), a member of the family Filoviridae that also includes the Ebola viruses. The disease was first recognized in 1967 following simultaneous outbreaks among laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), who had been exposed to infected African green monkeys imported from Uganda. This outbreak established MVD as a distinct clinical entity and identified its zoonotic origin in African wildlife.\nThe natural reservoir of Marburg virus is the Egyptian rousette fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), which is widely distributed across Africa. The virus circulates in these bat populations without causing apparent disease. Human infection typically occurs through prolonged exposure in mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies, where aerosolized virus from bat excreta or direct contact with bats may result in spillover infection. Once introduced into human populations, MVD spreads through direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected persons, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare-associated transmission has been a prominent feature of many MVD outbreaks, occurring when infection prevention and control measures are inadequate.\nThe clinical progression of MVD follows a pattern common to viral hemorrhagic fevers. Following an incubation period typically of five to ten days (range 3-21 days), illness begins abruptly with fever, severe headache, malaise, myalgia, and often gastrointestinal symptoms including watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. By day five of illness, many patients develop hemorrhagic manifestations, which can include bleeding from venipuncture sites, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, bleeding from mucous membranes, and internal hemorrhaging. Neurological symptoms including confusion, agitation, and in severe cases, seizures and coma, may develop. Multi-organ failure, severe bleeding, and shock characterize the terminal phase of illness in fatal cases. Case fatality rates for MVD have ranged from 23% to 88% in previous outbreaks, varying based on viral strain, outbreak context, and availability of supportive care.\nDiagnosis requires specialized laboratory testing, as clinical presentation alone cannot reliably distinguish MVD from other causes of viral hemorrhagic fever or even from some other severe infectious diseases such as malaria or typhoid fever in the early stages. Definitive diagnosis relies on detection of viral RNA through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), detection of viral antigens, or isolation of virus from clinical specimens. These tests require biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment or appropriate field laboratories with adequate biocontainment, as Marburg virus is classified as a Risk Group 4 pathogen.\nNo specific antiviral treatment has been approved for MVD, though several investigational therapeutics have shown promise in animal models and may be considered for compassionate use during outbreaks. Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure support, replacement of blood and clotting factors, management of secondary infections, and provision of respiratory support when needed. Early aggressive supportive care can significantly improve survival, as demonstrated in recent outbreaks where case fatality rates were substantially lower than historical averages when patients received intensive supportive therapy.\nSimilarly, no licensed vaccine exists for MVD, though several vaccine candidates are in development based on platforms similar to those used for Ebola vaccines. This absence of specific therapeutics and vaccines makes outbreak control heavily dependent on non-pharmaceutical interventions including case identification and isolation, contact tracing and monitoring, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, safe and dignified burial practices, and community engagement to promote risk reduction behaviors.\nThe Ethiopian outbreak represents only the 11th country globally to document MVD cases since the disease was first identified in 1967. Previous outbreak countries include Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and most recently Rwanda, which experienced its first outbreak in 2024 (66 cases including 15 deaths) before declaring the outbreak over on 20 December 2024. Tanzania reported its second MVD outbreak in 2025 (two confirmed and eight probable cases, all fatal). The cumulative documented global total of MVD cases across all outbreaks since 1967 approximates 600, making it a rare disease compared to many other infectious diseases, though its severity and epidemic potential make it a high-consequence pathogen requiring robust surveillance and preparedness.\nWhole genome sequencing analysis conducted on Ethiopian isolates indicates similarity to viral strains previously identified in East Africa, suggesting this outbreak resulted from a spillover event from the regional bat reservoir rather than importation from a distant geographic location. This finding is consistent with the known distribution of Egyptian rousette bats in the region and with previous patterns of MVD emergence in East Africa.\nThe response to the outbreak involves multiple partners coordinating with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health. Community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding have been intensified. Infection prevention and control measures are being strengthened in healthcare facilities. Vaccination of healthcare workers and other high-risk contacts may be considered using investigational vaccines under emergency use protocols if circumstances warrant and if vaccine supplies can be accessed. Risk communication and community engagement efforts aim to promote early care-seeking, safe burial practices, and risk reduction behaviors while combating stigma and misinformation.\nFrom a European public health perspective, ECDC’s risk assessment for this outbreak provides several conclusions. The likelihood of exposure to MVD for EU/EEA citizens visiting or living in Ethiopia is assessed as low, with uncertainties connected to the limited epidemiological information available at this early stage of the outbreak. The impact, assessed at population level, is low since the number of MVD cases expected among EU/EEA citizens in Ethiopia is very small. Therefore, the overall risk for EU/EEA citizens visiting or living in Ethiopia is assessed as low.\nIn the event that MVD cases are imported into the EU/EEA—for example, through an infected person traveling during the incubation period or early symptomatic phase—ECDC considers the likelihood of further transmission to be very low, and the associated impact low. Consequently, the overall risk for the EU/EEA is assessed as low. This assessment is based on several factors: the clinical severity of MVD means most patients are too ill to travel once symptoms are advanced; the well-developed healthcare systems and infection prevention and control capacity in EU/EEA countries are capable of safely isolating and managing viral hemorrhagic fever cases; and the limited opportunities for disease transmission in European settings compared to the circumstances present in outbreak settings in endemic countries.\nNevertheless, healthcare systems in EU/EEA countries maintain preparedness for potential importation of viral hemorrhagic fevers including MVD. This preparedness includes protocols for assessment of febrile travelers from affected areas, designated high-level isolation units capable of managing highly infectious diseases, trained healthcare personnel with appropriate personal protective equipment, and laboratory diagnostic capacity for rapid confirmation of cases. Healthcare providers should maintain awareness of MVD as a differential diagnosis in travelers from affected areas of Ethiopia who present with compatible symptoms, particularly if there is known exposure to caves, mines, or bat-inhabited areas, or contact with sick persons.\n\n\nEbola Virus Disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo\nThe Ebola virus disease outbreak in Kasai Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which was declared on 4 September 2025, appears to be reaching its conclusion. On 19 October 2025, WHO announced that the last Ebola patient in the DRC was discharged, initiating the 42-day countdown for declaring the outbreak over. A total of 19 patients have recovered from the disease (29.7% of all cases), and no new cases have been reported since 26 September 2025. As of 20 November 2025, of the 1,735 contacts (out of 1,787, or 97.3%) that were followed up, none remain under active monitoring.\nSince the outbreak was declared, and as of 20 November, there have been 64 cases (53 confirmed and 11 probable) and 45 deaths (34 confirmed and 11 probable), yielding an overall case fatality rate of 70.3%. All cases were reported from six health areas in Bulape health zone, Kasai Province, with the health areas of Dikolo (26 cases, 15 deaths) and Bulape (24 cases, 22 deaths) serving as the epicenters, together accounting for 78.1% of reported cases and 82.2% of all deaths.\nThe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this outbreak provide important insights. Based on whole genome sequencing analysis, the causative strain is not linked to previous outbreaks in the DRC, indicating this represents a new zoonotic spillover event rather than resurgence from a persistent infection or continuation of a previous outbreak chain. This finding has implications for understanding Ebola virus ecology and spillover dynamics. The initial phase of the outbreak was characterized by nosocomial spread and a superspreading event linked to the presumptive index case’s funeral, highlighting the critical importance of safe and dignified burial practices and robust infection prevention and control in healthcare settings.\nThe presumptive index case was a pregnant woman admitted to Bulape General Reference Hospital on 20 August 2025 with symptoms including fever, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, asthenia, and hemorrhagic manifestations (anal, oral, and nasal hemorrhage). She subsequently died due to multiple organ failure. Samples tested on 3 September at the country’s National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa confirmed Zaire ebolavirus as the causative agent.\nThe demographic and age distribution of cases showed notable patterns. On 28 September, WHO reported that 37 cases (57.8%) occurred in women, with patients’ ages ranging from under one year to 65 years. Children aged from under one year to nine years and individuals aged 20-29 years accounted for 25.0% (16 cases) and 23.4% (15 cases) of the total, respectively. The most affected populations included children, housekeepers, and farmers—groups likely to have had contact with the index case, her contacts, or contaminated environments. Four deaths occurred among healthcare workers, underscoring the occupational risk faced by those caring for Ebola patients.\nThe temporal dynamics of the outbreak showed evolution over the four-week period from epidemiological week 36 to week 39. The median time between symptom onset and isolation shortened from five days to two days, reflecting improving surveillance sensitivity, faster case detection, and more rapid isolation of cases. This improvement is critical for outbreak control, as each day an infectious person remains in the community represents opportunities for disease transmission. At the outbreak’s onset, a high proportion of cases and deaths occurred among children aged under one year to four years, and the case fatality rate was very high. As the outbreak progressed, the number of cases among children decreased, and the overall case fatality rate gradually declined, likely reflecting both improved clinical management and exhaustion of susceptible contacts in the initial transmission chains.\nWomen represented 60% of reported deaths, possibly reflecting their roles as primary caregivers for sick family members and their presence at the funeral of the index case. This gender disparity in mortality is consistent with patterns observed in some previous Ebola outbreaks, where cultural practices related to care for the sick and burial of the dead disproportionately expose women to infection risk.\nThe outbreak response mobilized rapidly following confirmation. Vaccination began in Kasai Province on 13 September using the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, which has demonstrated efficacy in outbreak settings. As of 16 November, a total of 44,453 people have been vaccinated using a combination of ring vaccination (targeting contacts and contacts of contacts) and geographically targeted vaccination for high-risk groups in hotspots reporting confirmed cases. Ring vaccination, which involves vaccinating a “ring” of people around each confirmed case, has proven highly effective in controlling Ebola outbreaks by creating a buffer of immunity that prevents further transmission. Geographically targeted vaccination extends protection more broadly in affected areas.\nA total of 31 patients received treatment with monoclonal antibody mAb114, one of the therapeutic options available for Ebola virus disease that has shown efficacy in clinical trials. The availability and deployment of both vaccines and therapeutics represent major advances in Ebola outbreak response compared to historical outbreaks, though challenges in access, logistics, and healthcare system capacity remain, particularly in remote areas.\nThe date of symptom onset for the last reported case was 23 September, with the last cases reported on 26 September in Bulape and Dikolo health areas of Bulape health zone. The epidemiological significance of the 42-day countdown, which began on 19 October following discharge of the last patient, derives from the maximum incubation period of Ebola virus disease (21 days) multiplied by two to account for the possibility of a missed chain of transmission. If 42 days pass without new cases emerging, authorities can have reasonable confidence that active transmission has ceased, though vigilance for possible resurgence remains important, as viral persistence in immune-privileged sites of survivors can occasionally lead to relapse or transmission months or even years after apparent recovery.\nThis outbreak represents the 16th recorded in the DRC since 1976 when Ebola virus was first identified in the country (then known as Zaire), and the eighth since 2018. The frequency of outbreaks in recent years reflects several factors: the presence of Ebola virus in wildlife reservoirs (primarily fruit bats) in extensive forested areas of the country, ongoing human-wildlife interfaces that create spillover opportunities, movement of populations for various reasons that can spread infection geographically, and perhaps improved surveillance capacity that detects outbreaks that might previously have gone unrecognized.\nThe DRC’s previous experience with multiple Ebola outbreaks has generated substantial institutional knowledge and response capacity. However, challenges persist including the vast geographic area, limited infrastructure, insecurity in some regions, and resource constraints. The relatively modest size of this outbreak (64 cases) compared to some previous outbreaks in the DRC (particularly the 2018-2020 North Kivu/Ituri outbreak with over 3,400 cases and the 1976 Yambuku outbreak with 318 cases) likely reflects combination of factors including rapid response, availability of vaccines and therapeutics, experience from previous outbreaks, and perhaps fortuitous factors such as outbreak location in a relatively accessible area and absence of major security challenges.\nFrom a broader public health perspective, Ebola outbreaks in the DRC will likely continue to occur periodically given the ecological presence of the virus, making sustained investment in preparedness, surveillance, laboratory capacity, and rapid response capabilities essential. The successful control of this outbreak provides encouragement that with appropriate tools, timely response, and community engagement, even this devastating disease can be controlled, though complacency would be unwarranted given the ongoing risk of future spillover events."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: European Union and European Economic Area\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nInfluenza - Unusually Early Seasonal Onset with A(H3N2) Subclade K Dominance\nThe 2025-2026 influenza season in the EU/EEA has commenced three to four weeks earlier than in the previous two years, marking a notable deviation from recent seasonal patterns. As documented in the European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) for week 47, influenza detections are increasing rapidly across the region despite respiratory illness presentation rates in primary care generally remaining at baseline or low levels. This discordance—rising laboratory detections without commensurate increases in clinical presentations—suggests the season is in its earliest phase, with laboratory surveillance providing an early warning signal that has not yet translated into widespread symptomatic disease in the community.\nThe epidemiology of this early-onset season demonstrates clear patterns. All EU/EEA countries reporting data indicate dominance of influenza A viruses, with A(H3N2) largely driving the increasing trend in recent weeks. Specifically, in primary care (ILI/ARI) virological surveillance for week 46 of 2025, influenza accounted for 211 detections. Of these, 197 were influenza A (99% of typed influenza viruses), with 39 being A(H1)pdm09 (25% of influenza A), 119 being A(H3) (75% of influenza A), and 39 unsubtyped. Only two influenza B detections occurred. In hospital SARI surveillance for the same period, 115 influenza detections were reported, with 89 being influenza A (99% of typed viruses) and similar subtype distribution: 12 A(H1)pdm09 (52% of subtyped influenza A) and 11 A(H3) (48% of subtyped influenza A).\nGenetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses provides critical insights into the antigenic composition of the circulating strains. Data from weeks 40-45 of 2025 show that among A(H1)pdm09 viruses characterized (141 viruses), 64% belonged to subclade 5a.2a.1(D.3.1), with 99% of these falling within the specific subclade 5a.2a.1(D.3.1) that corresponds to the vaccine strain. Among A(H3N2) viruses characterized (80 viruses), 36% belonged to subclade 2a.3a.1(K), with 82% within the dominant 2a.3a.1(K) subclade. Notably, this A(H3N2) subclade K has been the focus of ECDC’s heightened concern, as evidenced by the publication of a Threat Assessment Brief on 20 November 2025 specifically addressing the risk of influenza in the EU/EEA in the context of increasing circulation of A(H3N2) subclade K.\nWhile the detailed content of this Threat Assessment Brief is not provided in the surveillance documents, the fact that ECDC devoted a specific assessment to this viral subclade indicates recognition of its potential significance—whether due to antigenic drift from vaccine strains, increased transmissibility, enhanced virulence, or other factors that could impact the severity of the coming influenza season. A(H3N2) viruses have historically been associated with more severe disease, particularly in elderly populations, and are notorious for their propensity to undergo antigenic drift, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness when circulating strains diverge significantly from vaccine composition.\nThe age distribution of influenza circulation shows expected patterns. Circulation is highest in children aged 5-14 years, who typically serve as important vectors for influenza transmission in communities due to their high contact rates in school settings and households. However, early increases in hospitalization are being observed in some countries affecting all age groups but primarily adults aged 65 years and above. This pattern raises concern, as elderly populations experience higher rates of severe outcomes from influenza including pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic conditions, hospitalization, and death.\nThe public health burden of influenza is substantial, with annual epidemics causing an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness globally and 290,000-650,000 respiratory deaths according to WHO estimates. In the EU/EEA, seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity, mortality, healthcare utilization, and economic impact through work absenteeism. The elderly, very young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions bear disproportionate disease burden.\nThe unusually early start to the 2025-2026 season has several implications. First, it may result in a longer-than-usual influenza season, with correspondingly greater cumulative disease burden. Second, it creates temporal overlap with other respiratory viruses including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, potentially leading to co-circulation and even co-infections that could complicate clinical management and place additional strain on healthcare systems. Third, it provides less time for populations to receive seasonal influenza vaccination before virus circulation intensifies, potentially reducing the overall population-level impact of vaccination programs.\nECDC’s response to the early influenza activity includes the publication of the Threat Assessment Brief on A(H3N2) subclade K and urging those eligible for vaccination to get vaccinated without delay. This recommendation takes on particular urgency given the early onset of circulation and the fact that influenza vaccines require approximately two weeks post-administration to confer protection. For individuals planning to participate in mass gathering events such as the Jubilee celebrations in Italy (discussed in a separate section of the surveillance report), vaccination is especially important given the elevated transmission risk in crowded settings.\nThe mechanism of influenza transmission primarily involves respiratory droplets and aerosols produced through coughing, sneezing, or talking by infected individuals. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with contaminated surfaces (fomite transmission), though this route is considered less efficient than respiratory routes. The basic reproductive number (R0) for seasonal influenza typically ranges from 1-2, meaning each infected person transmits to one to two others on average in a fully susceptible population, though this can vary substantially based on viral characteristics, environmental conditions, and population behaviors.\nFrom a clinical perspective, the cornerstone of influenza prevention remains annual vaccination. Current influenza vaccines are quadrivalent, containing antigens from two influenza A strains (A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)) and two influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, though Yamagata has not been detected globally since 2020 and has been removed from some vaccine formulations). Vaccine effectiveness varies by season based on how well vaccine strains match circulating strains, with effectiveness typically ranging from 40-60% against medically attended illness in seasons with good match. Even when effectiveness is suboptimal, vaccination typically reduces disease severity and risk of complications.\nAntiviral medications, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir) and the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, are available for treatment and prophylaxis. These medications are most effective when initiated early in illness (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) and are particularly recommended for individuals at high risk of complications, those with severe illness, and those requiring hospitalization.\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions including respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, staying home when ill, and in some circumstances use of masks in healthcare or high-risk settings complement pharmaceutical interventions. During influenza epidemics, healthcare facilities may implement additional measures including visitor restrictions, heightened infection control precautions, and active surveillance for healthcare-associated transmission.\nThe concurrent monitoring of other respiratory viruses provides important context. SARS-CoV-2 circulation is decreasing across all age groups in the EU/EEA, suggesting that COVID-19 is not currently contributing substantially to respiratory disease burden. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants in weeks 43-44 of 2025 showed predominance of BA.2.86 (6% of detections), XFG (66%), and NB.1.8.1 (12%), indicating continued evolution of the virus though without apparent major phenotypic changes causing resurgence.\nRespiratory syncytial virus circulation is low but showing slow increases approximately one week later than the previous season. RSV detections in week 46 included 32 viruses in primary care and 43 in hospitals. These increases are visible in both primary care and hospital surveillance data from several countries, with children under five years predominantly affected. RSV typically causes bronchiolitis in infants and young children, characterized by wheezing, respiratory distress, and in severe cases, requirement for hospitalization and respiratory support. In elderly adults and immunocompromised individuals, RSV can also cause serious lower respiratory tract disease.\nThe pattern of slowly increasing RSV circulation about one week behind last season’s timeline suggests that the 2025-2026 RSV season may follow a similar trajectory to the previous year, though week-to-week monitoring remains essential as seasonal patterns can shift. The temporal relationship between influenza and RSV circulation patterns—with influenza appearing earlier than usual while RSV follows close to its previous season’s timeline—may result in greater temporal overlap between these two important pediatric respiratory pathogens than occurred in some recent seasons.\nHealthcare system implications of the early influenza season are already emerging. As noted, early increases in hospitalizations are being observed in some countries. As the season progresses and community circulation intensifies, hospitals can expect increased emergency department visits, hospital admissions, intensive care unit occupancy, and overall strain on healthcare resources. The impact on hospitalization remains limited at the current stage but bears close monitoring, particularly in regions experiencing more rapid increases in viral circulation.\nSurveillance data quality and representativeness are generally high for influenza in the EU/EEA, with most countries participating in both sentinel primary care surveillance (for ILI/ARI) and hospital-based SARI surveillance. The integrated presentation of epidemiological and virological data through the ERVISS platform provides near-real-time situational awareness that enables rapid public health response. However, surveillance systems face ongoing challenges including varying case definitions across countries, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, and the need to distinguish influenza from other causes of respiratory illness in the absence of laboratory confirmation.\nLooking ahead, the remainder of the 2025-2026 influenza season will require sustained vigilance. Key areas for monitoring include the rate of increase in case numbers, the severity of disease as reflected in hospitalization and intensive care admission rates, the age distribution of severe cases, the effectiveness of current vaccine strains against circulating viruses (particularly A(H3N2) subclade K), the occurrence of antiviral resistance, and the cumulative burden of disease. Public health messaging should emphasize the importance of vaccination for eligible populations, early medical attention for individuals at high risk who develop influenza-like symptoms, and implementation of basic respiratory infection prevention measures to reduce transmission.\nThe early onset of the season serves as a reminder that influenza remains a formidable public health challenge despite availability of vaccines and antivirals. The unpredictability of seasonal timing, the propensity of influenza viruses (particularly A(H3N2)) to undergo antigenic drift, and the annual need to update vaccine composition based on surveillance of circulating strains make influenza a persistent threat requiring sustained investment in surveillance, research, and preparedness infrastructure."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Bulgaria\n\nOverview of Week 47 Surveillance Data\nBulgaria’s week 47 surveillance data encompass 41 notifiable infectious diseases, ranging from vaccine-preventable diseases to vector-borne infections, gastrointestinal pathogens, sexually transmitted infections, and bloodborne viruses. The data demonstrate the country’s comprehensive surveillance system while highlighting several notable trends and developments that warrant public health attention.\n\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nInfluenza and Influenza-like Illness\nBulgaria’s respiratory virus surveillance for week 47 does not show dramatic changes compared to the previous week, though the country is participating in the broader European trend of early influenza season onset. Specific Bulgarian influenza data are not detailed in the national surveillance report for week 47, but given Bulgaria’s inclusion in the EU/EEA surveillance network and the documented EU-wide trends, Bulgarian public health authorities should anticipate increasing influenza activity consistent with regional patterns.\nThe relatively stable respiratory disease picture in Bulgaria during week 47 contrasts with the more dynamic situation described in the EU/EEA surveillance summary, possibly reflecting lag in disease onset, differences in surveillance sensitivity or reporting, or genuine geographic heterogeneity in influenza circulation patterns. However, given the interconnectedness of European populations and the known rapid geographic spread of influenza, Bulgaria should prepare for potential intensification of influenza activity in coming weeks consistent with the regional pattern.\n\n\nPertussis (Whooping Cough)\nDuring week 47 of 2025, Bulgaria registered one confirmed case of pertussis (whooping cough), representing no change from the previous week. From the beginning of 2025 through week 47, Bulgaria has registered 85 cases of pertussis. This marks a dramatic decrease compared to the same period in 2024, when 2,694 cases were registered—a decline of 2,609 cases or approximately 97%. This extraordinary reduction follows the substantial pertussis resurgence that occurred in 2024 across Europe and warrants careful examination.\nPertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that remains endemic globally despite widespread vaccination. The disease is characterized by paroxysmal coughing fits that can last for weeks or months, earning it the colloquial name “the 100-day cough.” Following an incubation period of 7-10 days, illness progresses through three stages: the catarrhal stage (1-2 weeks) resembling a common cold with runny nose, mild cough, and low-grade fever; the paroxysmal stage (2-6 weeks or longer) characterized by severe coughing fits often followed by a characteristic “whoop” sound during inspiration, post-tussive vomiting, and exhaustion; and the convalescent stage (weeks to months) with gradual recovery though cough may persist.\nIn infants, pertussis can be particularly severe, presenting with apneic episodes without the characteristic whoop, and carrying substantial risk of complications including pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, and death. The burden of disease and mortality are highest in infants too young to have completed the primary vaccination series.\nThe cyclical nature of pertussis epidemiology is well-recognized, with surges typically occurring every 3-5 years in most countries. The 2024 surge across Europe, including in Bulgaria, followed this expected pattern. The dramatic decline in 2025 likely reflects a combination of factors: depletion of the susceptible population during the 2024 surge (many individuals who would have been infected in 2025 were already infected in 2024), population immunity from recent vaccination and infection, and the expected downward phase of the epidemic cycle.\nHowever, this decline should not lead to complacency. Pertussis remains endemic, and immunity from both vaccination and natural infection wanes over time, typically within 5-10 years. Sustained high vaccination coverage is essential to prevent future resurgences. Additionally, the single confirmed case in week 47 serves as a reminder that transmission continues at low levels even during inter-epidemic periods.\nFrom a surveillance perspective, the 85 cases reported in 2025 through week 47 may underestimate true disease burden, as pertussis diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion and appropriate laboratory testing. Many cases, particularly in adolescents and adults who may have atypical presentations, likely go undiagnosed. PCR testing from nasopharyngeal specimens collected early in illness provides the most sensitive diagnostic approach, though serology can be useful for later presentations.\n\n\nScarlet Fever\nWeek 47 surveillance recorded 90 cases of scarlet fever in Bulgaria, representing a six-case increase from the previous week. These cases included 15 possible, 48 probable, and 27 confirmed cases. Year-to-date through week 47, Bulgaria has registered 3,150 cases of scarlet fever, compared to 7,925 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 4,775 cases or 60%.\nScarlet fever, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) producing erythrogenic toxins, typically affects children aged 5-15 years. The disease is characterized by sore throat, fever, and a distinctive sandpaper-like rash that blanches with pressure, beginning on the neck and chest before spreading to other body areas. Additional features include strawberry tongue, circumoral pallor, and Pastia’s lines (linear petechiae in skin folds). The disease is spread through respiratory droplets and direct contact.\nTreatment with appropriate antibiotics (typically penicillin or amoxicillin) shortens illness duration, reduces transmission, and prevents suppurative complications (peritonsillar abscess, cervical lymphadenitis) and non-suppurative sequelae including acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The dramatic decrease in cases compared to 2024 likely reflects natural fluctuation in streptococcal disease incidence, which can vary substantially year-to-year based on circulating strain types, population immunity, and environmental factors.\nFrom a public health perspective, scarlet fever serves as a sentinel for group A streptococcal disease more broadly. Monitoring trends helps identify periods of increased streptococcal circulation that might also manifest as increases in more serious invasive group A streptococcal infections. The current moderate level of scarlet fever activity (90 cases in week 47) does not suggest unusual streptococcal circulation, though ongoing surveillance remains important.\n\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\nBulgaria registered 442 cases of varicella during week 47, representing a 22-case increase from the previous week. Cases included 42 possible, 353 probable, and 47 confirmed. Year-to-date through week 47, 18,980 cases have been registered, compared to 23,818 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 4,838 cases or 20%.\nVaricella, caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), remains one of the most contagious infectious diseases, with secondary attack rates exceeding 90% in susceptible household contacts. Following an incubation period of 10-21 days (average 14-16 days), illness begins with prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, and anorexia, followed within 24 hours by the characteristic rash. The rash typically begins on the face and trunk before spreading to extremities, progressing through macular, papular, vesicular, and crusted stages. New crops of lesions appear over several days, resulting in lesions at various stages of development simultaneously—a hallmark feature distinguishing varicella from other vesicular exanthems.\nWhile typically a mild, self-limited disease in healthy children, varicella carries risk of complications including secondary bacterial infections of skin lesions (particularly with group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus), pneumonia, cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, and in rare cases, necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock syndrome. Adults, infants, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals face substantially higher risk of severe complications and mortality.\nBulgaria’s varicella vaccination policy and coverage rates influence disease epidemiology. The sustained moderate-to-high incidence (442 cases in week 47 despite being late November) indicates continued endemic circulation. The 20% decrease compared to 2024 may reflect several factors including natural year-to-year variation, increasing vaccination uptake if vaccination programs have expanded, and population immunity from previous exposure.\nThe seasonal pattern of varicella typically shows peaks in late winter and spring in temperate climates, with lower incidence during summer and early autumn. The observation of 442 cases in late November is consistent with the beginning of the usual high-transmission season. Healthcare providers should anticipate potential further increases in coming months and should counsel parents on recognition of complications warranting medical attention, particularly signs of bacterial superinfection (spreading erythema, increasing pain, fever recurrence after initial improvement) and neurological complications (severe headache, altered consciousness, ataxia).\n\n\nViral Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis\nWeek 47 recorded two cases of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis in Bulgaria (one probable and one confirmed), representing a one-case increase from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 83 cases have been registered, compared to 76 cases during the same period in 2024—an increase of seven cases or 9%.\nViral meningitis and meningoencephalitis represent a spectrum of central nervous system infections with diverse etiologies. Common causative agents include enteroviruses (particularly in summer and autumn), herpesviruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, HHV-6), arboviruses (in endemic regions and seasons), and less commonly, influenza viruses, measles, mumps, and other pathogens. Clinical presentation typically includes fever, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and in meningoencephalitis, altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological deficits.\nDiagnosis requires cerebrospinal fluid examination showing lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal or mildly elevated protein and normal glucose—distinguishing viral from bacterial meningitis, which typically shows neutrophilic pleocytosis, markedly elevated protein, and decreased glucose. Molecular diagnostics including PCR testing of CSF have substantially improved etiologic diagnosis, allowing identification of specific viral pathogens and guiding treatment decisions.\nWhile viral meningitis is generally less severe than bacterial meningitis, with most patients recovering fully, meningoencephalitis can cause significant morbidity including long-term cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and neurological deficits, particularly when caused by herpes simplex virus. Early recognition and initiation of acyclovir for suspected HSV encephalitis is critical, as delayed treatment is associated with worse outcomes.\nThe modest increase in cases compared to 2024 (7 additional cases year-to-date) does not suggest unusual activity but warrants continued monitoring. The etiology of Bulgarian cases is not specified in the surveillance report, though characterization of causative agents through systematic testing would provide valuable epidemiological insights and might identify clusters or outbreaks requiring public health response.\n\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\n\nLyme Borreliosis\nDuring week 47, Bulgaria registered five confirmed cases of Lyme borreliosis, unchanged from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 373 cases have been registered, compared to 371 cases during the same period in 2024—representing a two-case increase or 0.5% change, essentially stable.\nLyme borreliosis, caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (primarily B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii in Europe), is transmitted through bites of infected Ixodes ticks. Bulgaria’s geographic and ecological characteristics provide suitable habitat for tick populations, and Lyme borreliosis represents an important public health concern, particularly for individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to tick-infested environments including forestry workers, farmers, hunters, hikers, and campers.\nThe disease manifests in stages. Early localized infection (stage 1) typically presents with erythema migrans, an expanding annular rash that appears 3-30 days post-tick bite at the site of the bite. While often described as having a “bull’s-eye” appearance with central clearing, homogeneous erythema migrans without clearing is also common. Constitutional symptoms including fatigue, fever, headache, and arthralgias may accompany the rash.\nWithout treatment, infection can disseminate (early disseminated infection, stage 2), causing multiple erythema migrans lesions, facial nerve palsy or other cranial neuropathies, meningitis, carditis (particularly AV conduction abnormalities), and arthralgias. Late disseminated infection (stage 3) can develop months to years after initial infection and manifests as intermittent or chronic arthritis (particularly affecting large joints, especially the knee), chronic encephalomyelitis, or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (progressive skin changes predominantly on extensor surfaces of extremities).\nDiagnosis in early disease relies primarily on recognition of erythema migrans in the appropriate epidemiological context (tick exposure in endemic area), as serology is often negative in early disease. For later manifestations, two-tier serological testing (screening ELISA or immunofluorescence assay followed by confirmatory Western blot) is standard. However, serology cannot distinguish active from past infection, and positive results in asymptomatic individuals are common in endemic areas, necessitating careful clinical correlation.\nTreatment with appropriate antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for early disease; longer courses or intravenous ceftriaxone for neurological or cardiac involvement) is highly effective when initiated promptly. Prevention focuses on tick bite avoidance through protective clothing, use of repellents, environmental modifications to reduce tick habitat in residential areas, and prompt tick removal when bites occur (as transmission typically requires 36-48 hours of tick attachment).\nThe stable incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Bulgaria (373 cases year-to-date through week 47) during the current year suggests consistent surveillance and reporting. November represents the tail end of the tick activity season in Bulgaria, with peak transmission typically occurring in late spring and summer. The cases reported in week 47 likely represent a combination of late-season infections (as ticks can be active into late autumn during periods of mild weather) and delayed reporting of earlier infections.\n\n\nCrimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever\nWeek 47 recorded one confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Bulgaria, unchanged from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, only this single case has been registered, compared to one case during the same period in 2024.\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, caused by CCHF virus (a nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae), represents one of Bulgaria’s most serious endemic infectious diseases due to its high case fatality rate. The virus is maintained in nature through a tick-vertebrate-tick cycle, with Hyalomma ticks serving as both vectors and reservoirs. Multiple Hyalomma species can transmit the virus, and these ticks have a wide geographic distribution across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.\nHuman infection occurs through tick bites, crushing infected ticks, contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock (particularly during slaughtering or veterinary procedures), or nosocomial transmission through contact with blood or body fluids of infected patients. Occupational groups at elevated risk include agricultural workers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and healthcare workers caring for CCHF patients.\nFollowing an incubation period of 1-3 days after tick bite (or 5-6 days after contact with infected blood or tissues), illness begins abruptly with fever, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Within 3-5 days, hemorrhagic manifestations develop, including petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and bleeding from mucous membranes and venipuncture sites. Hepatomegaly, tachycardia, and lymphadenopathy are common. Severe disease progresses to hepatic failure, pulmonary failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock. Case fatality rates range from 10-40% in various outbreak series, with death typically occurring during the second week of illness.\nDiagnosis requires specialized laboratory testing including RT-PCR for viral RNA, ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies, and viral isolation (requiring BSL-4 containment). Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on fluid and electrolyte management, blood product replacement, and management of complications. Ribavirin has been used empirically in some patients, though evidence of efficacy is limited. Strict infection control measures are essential in healthcare settings to prevent nosocomial transmission, including isolation of patients, use of personal protective equipment, and safe handling of blood and body fluids.\nBulgaria has endemic CCHF transmission, with sporadic cases reported annually, primarily during the tick activity season (April-October). The single case reported in 2025 represents a relatively low incidence year, similar to 2024. However, even single cases warrant serious public health attention given the disease’s severity. Case investigation should include identification of the likely exposure source (tick bite vs. occupational exposure), contact tracing to identify individuals who may have had contact with patient blood or body fluids, and implementation of infection control measures in healthcare facilities that cared for the patient.\nPrevention of CCHF requires multi-faceted approaches including personal protective measures to avoid tick bites (particularly for individuals working in or visiting tick-infested areas), use of appropriate personal protective equipment and safe work practices for those handling livestock or working in slaughterhouses, and rigorous infection control in healthcare settings. Public health education targeted to high-risk occupational groups is particularly important in endemic areas like Bulgaria.\n\n\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nAcute Viral Hepatitis\nWeek 47 witnessed a dramatic surge in acute viral hepatitis cases in Bulgaria, with 86 cases registered—a 47-case increase from the previous week. Cases included three probable and 83 confirmed. Year-to-date through week 47, 1,403 cases have been registered, compared to 632 cases during the same period in 2024—an increase of 771 cases or 122%.\nThis substantial year-on-year increase and the particularly large weekly increment in week 47 represent the most notable development in Bulgaria’s surveillance data for this reporting period and warrant urgent investigation. Acute viral hepatitis can result from multiple etiologic agents with distinct epidemiology and transmission routes.\nHepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted fecally-orally through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact. Outbreaks often occur in settings with inadequate sanitation or in populations with low immunity following foodborne or waterborne exposure. Following an incubation period of 15-50 days (average 28-30 days), illness typically begins with fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, followed by jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools. While generally self-limited in healthy individuals, hepatitis A can cause acute liver failure in rare cases, particularly in older adults and those with underlying liver disease.\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is also transmitted through fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water in endemic regions (developing countries in Asia, Africa, Middle East), though foodborne transmission through undercooked pork or wild game and blood transfusion have also been documented in developed countries. Clinical presentation resembles hepatitis A, though hepatitis E carries higher risk of fulminant hepatic failure, particularly in pregnant women (in whom case fatality rates can reach 20-25% in the third trimester).\nThe Bulgarian surveillance data do not specify the etiologic breakdown of the acute viral hepatitis cases (HAV vs. HEV vs. other hepatotropic viruses). This information is critical for appropriate public health response, as outbreak control measures differ substantially based on etiology. For hepatitis A, identification of a common source (food item, food handler, contaminated water supply) and implementation of control measures (recall of contaminated products, exclusion of infected food handlers, vaccination of contacts) takes priority. For hepatitis E, identification of zoonotic sources (contaminated pork products) or environmental water contamination guides response.\nThe 122% increase in acute viral hepatitis cases compared to 2024 suggests several possibilities. An ongoing outbreak or multiple outbreaks may be occurring, potentially related to a common contaminated food product distributed across regions, contamination of water supplies, or person-to-person transmission in closed settings. Alternatively, changes in surveillance sensitivity or reporting practices could contribute to apparent increases, though the magnitude and abrupt nature of the increase suggests a true epidemiological phenomenon rather than artifact.\nThe surge in week 47 (47 additional cases compared to week 46) is particularly concerning and requires immediate epidemiological investigation. Bulgarian public health authorities should conduct detailed case investigations including exposure histories, food consumption histories, water sources, travel, and potential sick contacts. Cluster detection analysis by geographic location, temporal clustering, and shared exposures should be performed. Laboratory testing to determine specific viral etiology should be prioritized. If a common source is identified, urgent control measures including recalls, public notification, and preventive measures for exposed populations (immunoglobulin or vaccination for hepatitis A contacts) should be implemented.\nFrom a clinical perspective, healthcare providers in Bulgaria should maintain heightened awareness for hepatitis presentation, obtain appropriate diagnostic testing, report cases promptly to public health authorities, and counsel patients on transmission prevention to protect household and other contacts.\n\n\nSalmonellosis\nBulgaria registered 16 confirmed cases of salmonellosis during week 47, representing a 12-case increase from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 638 cases have been registered, compared to 882 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 244 cases or 28%.\nSalmonellosis, caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella species (particularly S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium), remains one of the most common bacterial foodborne infections globally. Transmission occurs primarily through consumption of contaminated food products, particularly undercooked poultry, eggs, unpasteurized dairy products, and produce contaminated through contact with animal feces or contaminated water. The infectious dose varies from fewer than 100 organisms for some virulent strains to over one million for less virulent strains, depending on bacterial strain virulence, food vehicle (high-fat foods may protect bacteria through the stomach’s acidic environment), and host factors.\nFollowing an incubation period of 6-72 hours (typically 12-36 hours), illness begins with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea (which may be bloody). Fever is common. In uncomplicated cases, illness is self-limited, resolving within 4-7 days. However, complications can occur, particularly in young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised persons. These complications include bacteremia (which can lead to focal infections such as osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or meningitis), severe dehydration requiring hospitalization, and post-infectious complications including reactive arthritis.\nThe 28% decrease in salmonellosis cases in 2025 compared to 2024 may reflect multiple factors including improved food safety practices, changes in food production and distribution, shifts in dietary patterns, or enhanced hygiene practices. However, the 12-case increase in week 47 compared to week 46 deserves attention to determine whether this represents a cluster or small outbreak requiring investigation.\nMost salmonellosis cases do not require antibiotic treatment, as illness is self-limited and antibiotic use can prolong carriage and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Treatment is supportive, focusing on hydration and electrolyte replacement. Antibiotics are reserved for patients with severe illness, those at high risk for invasive disease, and those with documented bacteremia or focal infections.\nPrevention of salmonellosis requires multi-level interventions including farm-level biosecurity measures to reduce Salmonella colonization of food animals, food processing controls to minimize contamination, safe food handling and preparation practices (thorough cooking, avoiding cross-contamination, proper refrigeration), and in outbreak settings, identification and recall of contaminated products.\n\n\nGastroenteritis and Enterocolitis\nWeek 47 recorded 173 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis in Bulgaria, representing a 26-case increase from the previous week. Cases included 68 possible, 94 probable, and 11 confirmed. Year-to-date through week 47, 8,679 cases have been registered, compared to 9,228 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 549 cases or 6%.\nThis broad diagnostic category encompasses acute gastrointestinal infections of diverse etiologies including viral (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus), bacterial (in addition to those reported in specific categories like salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis), and parasitic pathogens. The category serves as a catch-all for clinically apparent gastroenteritis where specific etiology is not determined or where pathogens fall outside more specific surveillance categories.\nThe clinical presentation varies based on causative agent but typically includes some combination of diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and malaise. Viral gastroenteritis, particularly norovirus, tends to have explosive onset with prominent vomiting, while bacterial gastroenteritis more often features fever and bloody diarrhea. Duration ranges from 24-48 hours for many viral etiologies to a week or more for some bacterial causes.\nThe public health significance of this surveillance category lies primarily in its utility for detecting outbreaks or unusual patterns of gastrointestinal disease that may not be captured through more specific diagnostic categories. The 6% decrease compared to 2024 and the relatively modest weekly case counts suggest stable endemic circulation without major outbreak activity. However, clusters of cases in specific settings (childcare facilities, schools, nursing homes, hospitals) warrant investigation even when overall population-level incidence is stable.\nPrevention of gastroenteritis focuses on hand hygiene (particularly after toilet use and before food handling), safe food preparation practices, clean water supplies, appropriate exclusion of symptomatic individuals from food handling and childcare activities, and environmental cleaning and disinfection in settings where outbreaks occur. For viral gastroenteritis, bleach-based disinfectants are preferred over alcohol-based products, as norovirus and other enteric viruses are resistant to alcohol disinfection.\n\n\nEscherichiosis (E. coli Infections)\nBulgaria registered six confirmed cases of escherichiosis during week 47, representing a two-case increase from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 293 cases have been registered, compared to 339 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 46 cases or 14%.\nThis category typically encompasses infections caused by diarrheagenic E. coli, including enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC, also known as verotoxigenic E. coli or VTEC). Each pathotype has distinct virulence mechanisms and clinical presentations.\nSTEC/VTEC, particularly serotype O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin-producing strains, warrants special attention due to its potential for severe complications including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)—a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure that occurs in approximately 5-10% of STEC infections, primarily affecting young children. HUS is the leading cause of acute renal failure in children in developed countries and can result in chronic renal impairment, hypertension, and other long-term sequelae.\nSTEC transmission occurs primarily through consumption of undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized dairy products, contaminated produce (particularly leafy greens), and contaminated water. Person-to-person transmission can occur, particularly in childcare settings. Cattle serve as the primary reservoir, with shedding in feces leading to environmental contamination.\nOther pathotypes of diarrheagenic E. coli cause various clinical syndromes. ETEC is a common cause of travelers’ diarrhea, producing heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins that cause profuse watery diarrhea. EPEC causes persistent diarrhea particularly in young children in developing countries. EIEC causes dysentery-like illness with invasive disease of the colonic mucosa. EAEC is increasingly recognized as causing persistent diarrhea in both children and adults.\nThe diagnostic category of “escherichiosis” in Bulgarian surveillance presumably encompasses these various E. coli infections, though specific breakdown by pathotype would provide more actionable epidemiological information. The 14% decrease compared to 2024 suggests no major outbreak activity, though continued surveillance remains important to detect clusters that might indicate foodborne or waterborne outbreaks requiring public health intervention.\nTreatment for most E. coli gastroenteritis is supportive. Notably, antibiotic treatment of STEC infections is contraindicated, as some studies suggest antibiotics may increase risk of HUS, possibly by inducing bacterial lysis and release of Shiga toxin. For other E. coli pathotypes, antibiotics may be considered in severe cases, though supportive care with hydration remains the mainstay of management.\n\n\nCampylobacteriosis\nBulgaria registered 16 confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis during week 47, representing a two-case increase from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 437 cases have been registered, compared to 307 cases during the same period in 2024—an increase of 130 cases or 42%.\nCampylobacteriosis, caused primarily by Campylobacter jejuni and less commonly C. coli, is one of the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis globally. In many developed countries, campylobacteriosis has surpassed salmonellosis as the most frequently reported bacterial enteric infection. Transmission occurs primarily through consumption of undercooked poultry (the predominant source), unpasteurized milk, contaminated water, and contact with infected animals (particularly puppies and kittens with diarrhea).\nFollowing an incubation period of 2-5 days, illness begins with prodromal symptoms of fever, headache, and myalgia, followed within 24 hours by abdominal pain (often severe and cramping) and diarrhea, which is frequently bloody. Illness typically resolves within a week without treatment, though symptoms can persist longer in some cases.\nComplications, while uncommon, include bacteremia (particularly in immunocompromised individuals), post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome—an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that represents the most serious complication of campylobacteriosis. Approximately 30-40% of Guillain-Barré syndrome cases are preceded by Campylobacter infection, with cross-reactivity between antibodies to Campylobacter lipo-oligosaccharides and gangliosides on neural tissue hypothesized to mediate pathogenesis.\nThe 42% increase in campylobacteriosis cases in Bulgaria compared to 2024 is notable and contrasts with the decreased incidence observed for several other foodborne infections including salmonellosis. This pattern may reflect several factors including increased diagnostic testing and reporting, true increases in disease incidence related to changes in food production or consumption patterns, or differential outbreak activity.\nMost campylobacteriosis cases do not require antibiotic treatment, as illness is self-limited. Antibiotics are considered for severe cases, immunocompromised individuals, and those with prolonged illness. Macrolides (particularly azithromycin) are generally preferred, though fluoroquinolones may be used in some settings, recognizing that fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter is widespread in many regions due to fluoroquinolone use in poultry production.\nPrevention focuses on safe food handling (particularly thorough cooking of poultry, preventing cross-contamination in kitchens), consumption of pasteurized dairy products, clean water supplies, and hand hygiene after contact with animals and before food preparation. At the regulatory level, interventions targeting reduction of Campylobacter colonization in poultry flocks and contamination of poultry carcasses during processing can reduce human disease burden.\n\n\nRotavirus Gastroenteritis\nWeek 47 recorded 13 confirmed cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in Bulgaria, representing a six-case decrease from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 681 cases have been registered, compared to 751 cases during the same period in 2024—a decrease of 70 cases or 9%.\nRotavirus is the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children worldwide, particularly affecting infants and children under five years of age. Prior to vaccine introduction, rotavirus infected nearly every child by age five, causing substantial morbidity through dehydration, healthcare utilization, and parental work loss, and mortality particularly in developing countries with limited access to rehydration therapy.\nTransmission occurs fecal-orally through direct person-to-person contact, contaminated surfaces and fomites, and possibly through respiratory droplets. The virus is extremely stable in the environment and highly infectious, with inocula as low as 10-100 viral particles capable of causing infection. Following an incubation period of 1-3 days, illness begins with vomiting, followed by profuse watery diarrhea lasting 3-8 days. Fever is common. Dehydration can develop rapidly, particularly in young infants.\nBulgaria’s rotavirus vaccination policy and coverage rates significantly influence disease epidemiology. Where high vaccination coverage is achieved with either RotaTeq or Rotarix vaccines (the two WHO-prequalified rotavirus vaccines), dramatic reductions in rotavirus hospitalizations and emergency department visits have been documented, with herd immunity effects protecting even unvaccinated individuals through reduced community transmission.\nThe 9% decrease in cases compared to 2024 may reflect increasing vaccination coverage if Bulgaria has recently enhanced its rotavirus immunization programs, though other factors including natural year-to-year variation and possibly impacts of COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral changes on transmission of enteric pathogens may also contribute.\nTreatment is supportive, focusing on rehydration (oral rehydration solution preferred; intravenous fluids for severe dehydration). Zinc supplementation may modestly reduce diarrhea duration and severity. Prevention relies primarily on vaccination, with rotavirus vaccines recommended by WHO for inclusion in all national immunization programs. Additional preventive measures include hand hygiene, though rotavirus’s environmental stability and high infectivity limit the effectiveness of hygiene measures alone in preventing transmission.\n\n\n\nContact and Direct Transmission\n\nHIV Infection\nBulgaria registered two confirmed cases of HIV infection during week 47, representing a three-case decrease from the previous week. Year-to-date through week 47, 274 cases have been registered, compared to 254 cases during the same period in 2024—an increase of 20 cases or 8%.\nThis modest increase in HIV diagnoses compared to the previous year warrants attention as part of ongoing HIV surveillance and prevention efforts. HIV epidemiology varies substantially across European countries, with different predominant transmission routes (men who have sex with men, injecting drug use, heterosexual transmission) and epidemic characteristics.\nSeveral factors may contribute to changes in reported HIV case counts, including true changes in incidence (new infections), changes in testing rates or testing strategies, migration patterns affecting the population at risk, and changes in reporting practices. The categorization as new HIV diagnoses in surveillance systems typically includes both recent and long-standing infections that are newly diagnosed, distinguishing them from incident infections (true new acquisitions of infection).\nFrom a public health perspective, the number of new HIV diagnoses reflects both HIV incidence and testing coverage. Increases in diagnosis numbers may represent either increasing incidence (concerning) or increasing testing uptake (potentially positive, as it brings more people into care). Detailed epidemiological analysis examining transmission categories, CD4 counts at diagnosis (as surrogate for timing of infection and late diagnosis), viral sequences (to identify transmission clusters), and testing patterns is essential to interpret trends appropriately.\n\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections - Syphilis, Congenital Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia\nBulgaria’s surveillance data for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) show mixed patterns. Syphilis cases numbered nine in week 47 (representing a five-case decrease from week 46), with 332 cases year-to-date compared to 299 in 2024 (an 11% increase). Congenital syphilis recorded no cases in week 47 (down one from week 46), with 34 cases year-to-date compared to 13 in 2024 (a 161% increase). Gonorrhea cases numbered two in week 47 (unchanged from week 46), with 109 cases year-to-date compared to 84 in 2024 (a 30% increase). Urogenital chlamydia infection recorded one case in week 47 (down one from week 46), with 170 cases year-to-date compared to 98 in 2024 (a 73% increase).\nThe pattern across these STIs shows concerning increases compared to 2024, with particularly dramatic rises in congenital syphilis (161%), chlamydia (73%), and substantial increases in gonorrhea (30%) and syphilis (11%). These increases align with broader European and global trends of rising STI incidence following decades of declining rates, likely driven by multiple factors including changes in sexual behavior, reduced fear of HIV/AIDS with effective treatment availability, decreased condom use, substance use facilitating risk behaviors, and possibly increased testing and reporting.\nThe 161% increase in congenital syphilis cases is particularly alarming, as congenital syphilis is entirely preventable through routine prenatal screening and treatment of syphilis-infected pregnant women. Congenital syphilis can result in stillbirth, neonatal death, and serious sequelae in surviving infants including skeletal abnormalities, neurological impairment, and multiorgan disease. Every case of congenital syphilis represents a failure of the healthcare system to screen and treat the mother during pregnancy.\nThis dramatic increase in congenital syphilis suggests gaps in Bulgaria’s prenatal care system that require urgent attention. Potential contributing factors include inadequate prenatal care attendance, failure to screen pregnant women for syphilis, delayed diagnosis or treatment initiation, treatment failure due to inappropriate regimens or adherence problems, or reinfection of treated women before delivery. Public health response should include review of prenatal screening protocols, ensuring all pregnant women receive screening early in pregnancy (with repeat screening in third trimester for high-risk women), prompt treatment with benzathine penicillin G for diagnosed cases, partner notification and treatment, and addressing barriers to prenatal care access.\nThe increases in other STIs reflect the urgent need for comprehensive sexual health services including accessible STI testing, prompt treatment, partner notification and treatment, sexual health education, and promotion of condom use and other preventive measures. The rise in gonorrhea is particularly concerning given increasing antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with resistance to fluoroquinolones widespread, resistance to azithromycin increasing, and emerging resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (the last remaining first-line treatment options) documented in some regions.\nFor chlamydia, the 73% increase may partly reflect expanded testing, as chlamydia is often asymptomatic and many cases historically went undiagnosed. However, true increases in incidence likely also contribute. Untreated chlamydia can lead to serious reproductive health consequences including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility in women, and epididymitis and reactive arthritis in men.\nFrom a public health perspective, STI control requires multi-component strategies including promotion of safer sexual practices, accessible testing services (including expansion of self-testing where appropriate), prompt treatment using antimicrobial stewardship principles to preserve effectiveness of existing treatments, partner notification and treatment, targeted interventions for populations at disproportionate risk, and continued surveillance including antimicrobial resistance monitoring."

    "text": "The confirmation of the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5N5) globally represents a sentinel event in zoonotic influenza surveillance. The patient, an older adult with underlying health conditions in Grays Harbor County, Washington, developed symptoms during week 43, was hospitalized in week 45, and died on 21 November 2025. Environmental samples from the patient’s backyard poultry flock tested positive for avian influenza, establishing the most likely exposure source as domestic poultry that had contact with wild birds.\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) viruses cause severe systemic disease in poultry with mortality rates approaching 100%, and human infections, while rare, can produce severe respiratory illness with high case fatality rates. The incubation period typically ranges from 2–8 days. Individuals with direct contact with infected birds, their secretions, or contaminated environments face the highest risk of infection.\nThe sequenced isolate (A/Washington/2148/2025) belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype A6, which has been detected in birds and mammals across North America and designated as EA-2021-I in European isolates. Critically, no mutations associated with mammalian adaptation were identified, and no human-to-human transmission has been detected among the patient’s contacts. This genetic profile aligns with strains circulating in wild birds across northern Europe during the current epidemiological year, where seven EU/EEA countries have reported detections. Additionally, A(H5N5) has been identified in wild mammals including Arctic fox, lynx, and American mink in Iceland and Norway since early 2024.\nThe US CDC assesses risk to the general population as low, and this assessment extends to EU/EEA populations. However, the global significance of this first human H5N5 infection necessitates enhanced surveillance, particularly for individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to poultry and wild birds.\n\n\n\nOn 24 November 2025, WHO confirmed a second global human case of avian influenza A(H5N2), occurring in a young woman without underlying conditions in Mexico City. The patient was exposed to birds and a dog that tested positive for A(H5) in her residential area. Unlike the first human case reported in April 2024 (which involved low pathogenic avian influenza), this strain demonstrates a highly pathogenic avian influenza signature in the hemagglutinin segment, though it lacks mutations known to increase zoonotic potential. No human-to-human transmission has been identified, and the risk for EU/EEA populations remains low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthiopia is experiencing its first-ever Marburg virus disease outbreak, confirmed on 14 November 2025 following detection of suspected cases in Jinka city in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region. As of 27 November, 15 cases (12 laboratory-confirmed, 3 probable) have been reported with 11 deaths, yielding a case fatality rate of 66.7%.\nMarburg virus causes a severe hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates historically reaching 88% in some outbreaks. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected persons or animals, with an incubation period of 5–10 days (range 3–21 days). Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family serve as the natural reservoir. Clinical presentation includes sudden fever, severe headache, muscle pain, fatigue, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms and, in later stages, unexplained bleeding. Healthcare workers face particular occupational risk, with two deaths already reported among this group.\nA concerning development is the geographic expansion to Hawassa City, Sidama Region, following return travel from Jinka City, indicating potential for wider dissemination. Contact tracing has identified 349 individuals, with 119 having completed their 21-day monitoring period. Whole genome sequencing reveals similarities to previously identified East African strains. The WHO and Ethiopian health authorities are coordinating response efforts including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, and community engagement.\nECDC assesses the risk for EU/EEA citizens visiting or living in Ethiopia as low, with the likelihood of importation and secondary transmission within the EU/EEA considered very low. Jinka serves as a tourist hub for the region, though it remains relatively remote from Addis Ababa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal cholera transmission continues at elevated levels with 577,843 cases and 7,395 deaths reported since 1 January 2025—a 17% increase in cases compared to the same period in 2024. During the most recent reporting period (29 October–25 November), 15,394 new cases and 194 deaths were recorded, with Afghanistan (10,781 cases), Angola (2,493), Sudan (1,117), Burundi (567), and Ethiopia (413) contributing the highest case counts.\nSudan presents the most concerning mortality profile, reporting 114 deaths during this period—59% of global cholera deaths—reflecting the compound effects of armed conflict, population displacement, and healthcare system collapse. South Sudan has reported 78,034 cumulative cases in 2025 compared to only 114 during the same period in 2024, representing a catastrophic surge. Angola and Chad continue to experience ongoing transmission, while outbreaks persist across multiple regions in Asia (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Nepal) and East Africa (Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique).\nThe risk of cholera infection for EU/EEA travelers remains low, though sporadic importation is possible. Vaccination should be considered for emergency and relief workers deployed to affected regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in Kasai Province, DRC, appears to be waning, with the 42-day countdown to declare the outbreak officially concluded initiated on 19 October 2025 following discharge of the last patient. Since outbreak declaration on 4 September, 64 cases (53 confirmed, 11 probable) and 45 deaths (case fatality rate 70.3%) have been recorded, all from Bulape health zone. No new cases have been reported since 26 September, and no contacts remain under active monitoring. A total of 44,453 individuals have received vaccination. This represents the sixteenth Ebola outbreak in DRC since 1976 and the eighth since 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025–26 influenza season has begun three to four weeks earlier than in the previous two years, with over half of EU/EEA countries now reporting above-baseline activity. Influenza A dominates circulation (99% of typed specimens), with A(H3N2) subclade 2a.3a.1(K) accounting for 85% of genetically characterized A(H3) specimens and driving the current increasing trend. Children aged 5–14 years show the highest circulation rates, while early hospitalization increases are primarily affecting adults aged 65 years and above.\nIn week 48, primary care sentinel surveillance detected 256 influenza specimens with 16% pooled positivity (median 4.6%; IQR 2.9–8.3%), while hospital SARI surveillance identified 139 influenza specimens with 14% pooled positivity. Eight countries report baseline activity levels, eight report low intensity, and two report medium intensity. Geographic spread ranges from sporadic (5 countries) to widespread (5 countries).\nECDC published a Threat Assessment Brief on 20 November 2025 evaluating the risk associated with increasing A(H3N2) subclade K circulation. Respiratory syncytial virus activity is slowly increasing from low levels, approximately one week later than the previous season, predominantly affecting children under five years. SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate but is decreasing across all age groups.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 pertussis epidemic that swept across Europe has receded substantially. While not directly captured in week 48 EU/EEA data, the Bulgarian surveillance reveals the epidemic’s trajectory: year-to-date 2025 cases (88) represent a 96.8% decrease from 2024 (2,709). This pattern likely reflects similar trends across EU/EEA Member States where pertussis surged in 2024 following pandemic-related disruptions to childhood vaccination programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ongoing hepatitis A virus outbreak affecting Austria, Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia has now exceeded 6,000 cumulative cases in 2025 with 39 deaths, representing one of the largest HAV outbreaks in EU/EEA history. Sequencing analyses have identified two closely related HAV sub-genotype IB clusters, differing by a single nucleotide, with Cluster A comprising cases from Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Sweden, and Cluster B encompassing cases from Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nHepatitis A virus is highly transmissible through the fecal-oral route, with an incubation period averaging four weeks (range 2–6 weeks). The virus demonstrates remarkable environmental stability, resisting acidification and freezing. While often producing mild or asymptomatic infection in children, adults—particularly those with underlying liver disease or alcohol use disorders—may develop severe acute hepatitis with potential for fulminant hepatic failure.\nThe epidemiological profile varies considerably by country: Czechia has reported 2,310 cases and 27 deaths, with 16% of cases linked to identified outbreaks and 17% involving risk factors including intravenous drug use (178), homelessness (188), or incarceration (27). Slovakia reports 2,482 cases with ongoing transmission in Roma communities and those living in poor sanitary conditions. Hungary has recorded 1,548 cases with the highest incidence rates among children aged 3–9 years and in northeastern counties. Austria reports 216 cases with significant representation among people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs, with Vienna as the outbreak epicenter.\nNo food source has been implicated; person-to-person transmission among groups with limited access to proper sanitation drives ongoing transmission. ECDC assesses risk as moderate-to-high for affected populations and low-to-moderate for the general population with access to sanitation and healthcare. Targeted vaccination campaigns are underway in affected countries, though vaccine availability remains challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal chikungunya transmission has continued in France and Italy during the 2025 season, with 795 and 385 locally acquired cases respectively reported as of 26 November. France reported 15 new locally acquired cases in week 48, distributed across 79 clusters with 9 currently active. Italy has not reported new cases this week.\nChikungunya virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in Europe. The disease presents with acute onset of high fever and severe arthralgia, typically 4–7 days post-exposure. While mortality is low, debilitating joint pain may persist for months to years, particularly in older adults. The persistence of active clusters despite seasonal weather conditions becoming unfavourable suggests potential for late-season transmission and warrants continued vigilance for delayed diagnoses in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nFourteen countries have reported human West Nile virus cases during 2025, including Bulgaria (among EU/EEA countries also reporting: Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Spain) and neighboring countries (Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Serbia, Türkiye). A total of 157 affected areas have been identified. The vector transmission season is concluding, though delayed case reporting may continue for several weeks."

    "text": "Salmonellosis\nTwenty-three salmonellosis cases were confirmed during week 48, representing a 43.8% increase from the previous week (16 cases). Cases were geographically dispersed across multiple regions including Sofia city (5), Plovdiv (1), and Pleven (4). Year-to-date cases (661) are 25.7% lower than 2024 (890), though the week-to-week increase warrants attention to potential clustering.\nSalmonellosis, typically caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars, is transmitted through contaminated food products, particularly poultry, eggs, and unpasteurized dairy. The incubation period is 6–72 hours, with clinical presentation ranging from self-limited gastroenteritis to invasive disease in vulnerable populations. Antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella isolates remains a concern for public health surveillance.\n\nCampylobacteriosis\nNineteen campylobacteriosis cases were confirmed during week 48, an increase of 3 cases from the previous week. Sofia city reported the highest count (9 cases), followed by Varna (5). Notably, year-to-date cases (456) exceed 2024 totals (316) by 44.3%, representing a sustained increase throughout 2025 that warrants investigation into potential sources and risk factors.\nCampylobacter species, predominantly C. jejuni and C. coli, are the leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in developed countries. Transmission occurs through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water, with an incubation period of 1–10 days. Post-infectious sequelae including Guillain-Barré syndrome and reactive arthritis occur in a small percentage of cases.\n\n\nRotavirus Gastroenteritis\nTen rotavirus gastroenteritis cases were confirmed during week 48, a decrease of 3 from the previous week. Cases were distributed across Sofia city (4), Pleven (2), and several other regions. Year-to-date cases (691) are 12.4% lower than 2024 (789), likely reflecting continued benefits of childhood rotavirus vaccination programs."

Of particular concern, congenital syphilis cases have reached 34 year-to-date compared to 14 in 2024—a 143% increase—signaling potential gaps in prenatal screening and treatment programs.\nGonorrhea recorded 5 confirmed cases during week 48, an increase of 3 from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (114) represent a 28.1% increase compared to 2024 (89).\nUrogenital chlamydia infection showed 5 cases during week 48, a substantial increase from the previous week (1 case). Year-to-date cases (175) demonstrate a 69.9% increase compared to 2024 (103), the most pronounced increase among bacterial STIs.\nHIV infections numbered 3 during week 48, an increase of 1 from the previous week. Year-to-date cases (277) represent a 7.4% increase compared to 2024 (258).\nThe consistent upward trends across all STI categories suggest systemic factors potentially including reduced prevention services, changing sexual behaviors, or improved case detection. The dramatic increase in congenital syphilis cases—from 14 to 34 year-to-date—represents a particularly urgent public health concern requiring immediate attention to prenatal care services."

Varicella vaccination is not included in Bulgaria’s routine childhood immunization schedule, resulting in continued endemic circulation with seasonal winter-spring peaks.\n\n\nScarlet Fever\nNinety-nine scarlet fever cases were reported during week 48, an increase of 9 cases from the previous week. Case classification included 23 possible, 43 probable, and 33 confirmed cases. The highest case counts were reported from Plovdiv (26), Sofia city (17), and Varna (14).

    "text": "Заседанието на Европейската агенция по лекарствата през декември 2025 г. доведе до няколко клинично значими регулаторни решения, които ще окажат влияние върху грижите за пациентите в ЕС/ЕИП. Комитетът по лекарствени продукти за хуманна употреба (CHMP) препоръча условно разрешение за пускане на пазара на Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept) за лечение на високорисков немусцулно-инвазивен рак на пикочния мехур, адресирайки значима незадоволена медицинска потребност, като се има предвид, че ракът на пикочния мехур засяга над 200 000 души годишно в Европейския съюз, като повечето случаи са от този немусцулно-инвазивен подтип. Условната процедура за одобрение отразява спешните терапевтични нужди, докато се събират допълнителни потвърдителни данни.\nКомитетът препоръча разрешение за пускане на пазара на Aumseqa (aumolertinib) за EGFR-позитивен недребноклетъчен рак на белия дроб, Exdensur (depemokimab) за тежка еозинофилна астма и тежък хроничен риносинуит с назални полипи, както и Myqorzo (aficamten) за обструктивна хипертрофична кардиомиопатия. За профилактика на COVID-19 Mnexspike (mRNA ваксина срещу COVID-19) получи положително становище за лица на възраст 12 години и повече, разширявайки ваксиналния портфейл, наличен през текущия зимен сезон.\nДва биоподобни лекарствени продукта (генерици) получиха положителни становища: Gotenfia (golimumab) за възпалителни заболявания, включително ревматоиден артрит и улцерозен колит, и Ranluspec (ranibizumab) за ретинопатии. Биоподобните продукти продължават да подобряват достъпа до биологични терапии, като същевременно намаляват разходите за здравеопазване.\nОсобено значимо беше разширяването на показанията на Mounjaro (tirzepatide) за включване на юноши и деца от 10-годишна възраст за лечение на захарен диабет тип 2, който не е адекватно контролиран. Това разширяване адресира нарастващите опасения относно педиатричния диабет тип 2, свързан с увеличаващите се нива на детско затлъстяване. Комитетът също така препоръча още 11 разширения на показанията за вече разрешени лекарствени продукти.\nCHMP издаде отрицателно становище за Blarcamesine Anavex (blarcamesine), предназначен за лечение на болестта на Алцхаймер, като заключи, че основното проучване не е демонстрирало ефективност и безопасност при пациенти с ранна форма на болестта на Алцхаймер, които нямат мутации в гена SIGMAR1. Това решение подчертава продължаващите предизвикателства при разработването на ефективни терапии за невродегенеративни заболявания и строгите стандарти за доказателственост, поддържани от регулаторните органи."

    "text": "Инфекциозни заболявания: Европейски съюз/Европейско икономическо пространство\nАктивността на грипа ескалира през седмица 50, като повечето държави от ЕС/ЕИП вече докладват широко географско разпространение с ниска до средна интензивност. Това представлява продължение на сезон, започнал три до четири седмици по-рано спрямо предходните две години, което създава особена загриженост, тъй като пикът на предаването може да съвпадне с декемврийските празници, когато здравните системи функционират с намален персонал, а увеличените пътувания улесняват разпространението на вирусите.\nПрез седмица 49 (последната седмица с пълни вирусологични данни) в първичната медицинска помощ бяха открити 934 проби, положителни за грип, като грип A представляваше 99% от детекциите. Сред типираните проби A(H3N2) съставляваше 82% (587 случая), докато A(H1N1)pdm09 представляваше 18% (128 случая). Докладвана е само една детекция на грип B. Болничният надзор разкри 398 положителни за грип проби, като A(H3N2) съставляваше 63%, а A(H1N1)pdm09 — 37% от типираните проби.\nГенетичната характеристика за периода седмици 40–49 показва доминиране на субклада A(H3N2) 2a.3a.1(K) с 91% (277 от 305 характеризирани вируса), с по-малки пропорции на субклада 2a.3a.1(J.2) — 4%. Доминирането на H3N2 е обезпокоително, тъй като сезоните с преобладаване на H3N2 исторически водят до по-висока заболеваемост и смъртност, особено сред възрастните хора. Увеличения на хоспитализациите се наблюдават във всички възрастови групи, но засягат предимно лица на възраст 65 години и повече.\nБроят на пациентите, посещаващи първичната медицинска помощ с грипоподобно заболяване или симптоми на остра респираторна инфекция, е повишен в приблизително половината от докладващите държави. За седмица 49 данните за интензивност показват седем държави на базово ниво, две на ниско и една на средно ниво. Данните за географско разпространение показват седем държави със спорадична активност, две с регионално разпространение и 14 с широко разпространено предаване на грипа. Циркулацията е най-висока сред децата на възраст 5–14 години, въпреки че тежкото протичане засяга непропорционално възрастните хора.\nECDC публикува през този период Кратка оценка на заплахата, оценяваща риска от грип за ЕС/ЕИП в контекста на нарастващата циркулация на субклада A(H3N2) K. Основните препоръки включват ваксинация на всички допустими групи, особено на тези с висок риск, подходящо използване на антивирусни средства за лечение и постекспозиционна профилактика, използване на лицеви маски в здравни и дългосрочни грижи и готовност на здравните системи, включително планиране на капацитет за пиково натоварване. Тези препоръки изискват спешно прилагане предвид текущата епидемиологична ситуация и наближаващия празничен период.\nЦиркулацията на респираторния синцитиален вирус (RSV) нараства бавно от ниски нива, въпреки че през седмица 49 беше наблюдаван лек спад. През тази седмица в първичната помощ бяха открити 87 RSV-положителни проби (3% позитивност), като RSV-A и RSV-B представляваха по 50% от типираните проби. Болничните данни показаха 88 RSV-положителни проби (6,2% позитивност), като RSV-B съставляваше 62% от типираните проби. Нарастващи хоспитализации, свързани с RSV, се наблюдават предимно сред деца под петгодишна възраст в няколко държави. Като цяло циркулацията на RSV остава под нивата, наблюдавани по това време през предходните четири сезона.\nSARS-CoV-2 продължава да циркулира, но намалява във всички възрастови групи, като в момента има ограничено въздействие върху хоспитализациите. През седмица 49 в първичната помощ бяха открити 180 SARS-CoV-2-положителни проби (6,2% позитивност) и 65 положителни проби в болниците (4,5% позитивност). Ограничените данни за варианти показват детекция на варианта XFG в една държава (19 детекции, 68% дял) и NB.1.8.1 в една държава (5 детекции, 18% дял).\nНадзорът за морбили за октомври 2025 г. (последният месец с пълни данни) показва 83 случая, докладвани от девет държави от ЕС/ЕИП, като 19 държави са докладвали нула случаи. Това представлява намаление спрямо предходните месеци, в съответствие със сезонността на морбили.\nДопълнителният епидемичен разузнавателен надзор, проведен на 9–10 декември, установи едно активно огнище в Полша с 26 случая в регион Подкарпатие към 3 декември. Местните здравни власти извършват активно проследяване на контактите, предлагат безплатна ваксинация и ограничават болничните посещения. Няколко държави от ЕС/ЕИП докладваха спорадични случаи: Ирландия съобщи за три случая през седмица 48, всички в регионите Дъблин и Североизток, без други случаи през предходните 12 седмици. Германия докладва 11 нови случая между 13 ноември и 9 декември, с което общият брой за 2025 г. достигна 278 случая. Нидерландия съобщи за 12 нови случаи между 5 ноември и 3 декември."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Global Perspective\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\n\nDengue: 2024 Global Summary and Implications for 2026\nThe WHO’s year-end Weekly Epidemiological Record confirmed that 2024 constituted the most severe global dengue burden on record, with 14,434,584 reported cases, 7,718,585 laboratory confirmations, 52,738 severe cases, and 11,201 deaths across all six WHO regions. This represents more than a three-fold increase compared to approximately 4.1 million cases reported in 2023, marking an unprecedented acceleration in dengue transmission dynamics.\nDengue fever, caused by four serotypes of the Flavivirus genus (DENV-1 through DENV-4) and transmitted primarily through Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, has expanded from fewer than 10 endemic countries in the 1970s to over 130 today. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection through classical dengue fever—characterised by high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and rash with an incubation period of 4–10 days—to life-threatening severe dengue with plasma leakage, haemorrhagic manifestations, and organ impairment. Secondary infection with a heterologous serotype substantially increases the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement. There is no specific antiviral treatment; management relies on early recognition, supportive care with fluid management, and monitoring for warning signs of severe disease.\nRegional Distribution: The Region of the Americas bore the overwhelming burden, accounting for over 90% of global cases. Brazil alone reported 10,266,017 cases and 6,321 deaths, with hyperendemic circulation of all four serotypes. Argentina recorded its largest epidemic to date with 581,559 cases and 408 deaths across 19 provinces. Mexico (558,846 cases), Colombia (320,982 cases), Paraguay (295,785 cases), and Peru (271,531 cases) also experienced historically high caseloads. The convergence of El Niño-associated heavy rainfall, high population density, and inconsistent vector control measures drove this explosive regional outbreak.\nSouth-East Asia reported 798,690 cases with 2,400 deaths, with Indonesia (257,271 cases, 1,461 deaths), India (232,425 cases), Bangladesh (101,214 cases, 557 deaths), and Thailand (104,681 cases) experiencing substantial monsoon-related transmission surges.\nFirst Autochthonous Transmission in Iran: In a significant epidemiological development, the Islamic Republic of Iran confirmed its first locally acquired dengue cases in June 2024. Two infections were initially identified in Bandar-Lengeh, Hormozgan Province, linked to established Aedes aegypti presence. By mid-July 2024, 12 locally acquired cases had been documented, marking Iran’s first indigenous dengue transmission and reflecting both vector establishment and increased population movement from endemic regions.\nEuropean Implications: The WHO European Region reported 1,603 cases, predominantly from endemic French overseas territories—Réunion (1,227 cases) and Mayotte (68 cases)—where year-round Aedes aegypti activity sustains transmission. Sporadic autochthonous transmission on mainland Europe included 213 cases in Italy, 85 in France, and 10 in Spain, consistent with recent annual patterns. The established presence of Aedes albopictus across southern Europe and its continued northward expansion necessitates integrated arboviral surveillance capacity.\nThe 2024 dengue surge underscores the climate sensitivity of this arbovirus, coinciding with El Niño weather anomalies that extended transmission seasons and geographic range. The concurrent circulation of all four serotypes across multiple regions, with DENV-3 predominating for the first time in a decade in Mexico and Central America during the latter half of 2024, raises concerns regarding increased severe disease risk among populations with prior heterologous exposure. WHO declared a Grade 3 dengue emergency from December 2023 through December 2024, activating the highest incident management level with coordination across all six regional offices."

    "text": "Infectious Diseases: Bulgaria\n\nFecal-Oral Transmission\n\nAcute Viral Hepatitis: Significant Year-Over-Year Increase\nBulgaria registered 20 cases of acute viral hepatitis during Week 01, representing a 150% increase compared to the 8 cases reported during the same period in 2025, while remaining unchanged from the preceding week. Of these, 18 were laboratory confirmed, with 1 possible and 1 probable case. The report aggregates hepatitis types (A, B, C, D, E, and unspecified), precluding determination of which specific hepatitis virus is driving this increase.\nHepatitis A, transmitted through the faecal-oral route via contaminated food, water, or direct contact, typically presents with an incubation period of 15–50 days followed by acute onset of fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and jaundice. While generally self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, it can cause prolonged illness and rarely fulminant hepatic failure, particularly in adults and those with underlying liver disease. Hepatitis E shares similar transmission dynamics in endemic settings, though zoonotic genotypes (3 and 4) are increasingly recognised in Europe through consumption of undercooked pork products.\nThe observed increase warrants enhanced surveillance to identify the predominant viral type, potential common-source exposures, and affected demographic groups. Should hepatitis A predominate, consideration of targeted vaccination in affected communities may be indicated.\n\n\nSalmonellosis: Notable Increase from Low Baseline\nNine laboratory-confirmed salmonellosis cases were reported during Week 01, representing an eight-fold increase compared to the single case registered during the equivalent period in 2025, though showing a modest decrease of 2 cases from the preceding week. Salmonellosis, caused predominantly by Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium in Europe, typically manifests 6–72 hours following ingestion of contaminated food—commonly eggs, poultry, or produce—with acute onset gastroenteritis characterised by diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal cramping, usually resolving within 4–7 days. Invasive disease with bacteraemia occurs in approximately 5% of cases, particularly among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and the elderly.\nWhile the absolute numbers remain modest, the year-over-year trajectory merits attention, particularly for identifying potential point-source contamination events.\n\n\nGastroenteritis and Enterocolitis: Elevated Incidence\nA total of 109 cases of gastroenteritis and enterocolitis were reported nationally, representing a 30% increase from the 84 cases during the same week in 2025 and an increase of 10 cases from the preceding week. Case classification revealed 52 possible, 52 probable, and 5 confirmed cases, indicating substantial clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation. The non-specific nature of this syndromic category encompasses multiple aetiologies including viral (norovirus, adenovirus), bacterial, and parasitic causes.\nThe winter period typically sees elevated gastroenteritis incidence, driven predominantly by norovirus circulation. The concurrent increase in confirmed salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis suggests that a proportion of these syndromic cases may have bacterial aetiology warranting enhanced laboratory investigation.\n\n\nCampylobacteriosis: Emergence from Zero Baseline\nSeven laboratory-confirmed campylobacteriosis cases were registered during Week 01, compared to zero cases during the equivalent week in 2025. Campylobacter, primarily C. jejuni and C. coli, represents the most frequently reported bacterial gastrointestinal pathogen in the European Union. Transmission occurs through consumption of contaminated poultry, unpasteurised milk, or cross-contaminated foods. Following an incubation period of 2–5 days, infection typically presents with watery or bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and fever. While usually self-limiting, campylobacteriosis is associated with post-infectious complications including reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\nThe appearance of seven cases where none were reported in the corresponding period of 2025 may reflect enhanced surveillance, changes in laboratory testing practices, or genuine increased exposure. Geographic distribution (all cases from Varna and Sofia city) suggests localised transmission or reporting patterns requiring further characterisation.\n\n\nShigellosis and Other Enteric Pathogens\nA single laboratory-confirmed shigellosis case was reported from Varna, compared to zero cases during the same period in 2025. Single cases of yersiniosis (confirmed) and two cases of Escherichia coli infection were also documented. These sporadic cases do not indicate outbreak activity but warrant routine surveillance continuation.\nRotavirus gastroenteritis showed a marked decline with only 3 cases versus 21 during the same period in 2025, likely reflecting both seasonal variation and the impact of routine childhood rotavirus vaccination.\n\n\n\nRespiratory and Droplet Transmission\n\nVaricella: Expected Seasonal Activity Below Prior Year\nVaricella (chickenpox) accounted for 278 cases during Week 01, representing a 47% decrease compared to 524 cases in the equivalent 2025 week and a reduction of 18 cases from the preceding week. Case classification comprised 22 possible, 230 probable, and 26 confirmed cases. Geographic distribution showed highest concentrations in Varna (58 cases), Sofia city (36 cases), and Plovdiv (25 cases).\nVaricella-zoster virus, a highly contagious herpesvirus transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular fluid, typically affects children aged 1–9 years in countries without universal vaccination programmes. The incubation period of 14–16 days is followed by prodromal fever and characteristic pruritic vesicular rash progressing through papular, vesicular, and crusting stages. While generally benign in immunocompetent children, complications include bacterial superinfection, pneumonia, and neurological sequelae. Adults, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals face substantially higher complication rates.\nBulgaria does not include varicella vaccination in its routine childhood immunisation schedule, resulting in continued endemic circulation with typical winter-spring seasonality. The year-over-year decrease likely reflects natural epidemic cycling rather than programmatic intervention.\n\n\nScarlet Fever: Declining Incidence\nFifteen scarlet fever cases were registered (1 possible, 12 probable, 2 confirmed), representing a 44% decrease from 27 cases in the same 2025 period. Scarlet fever, caused by group A Streptococcus pyogenes producing pyrogenic exotoxins, presents with fever, pharyngitis, and characteristic sandpaper-textured erythematous rash following a 1–3 day incubation period. European countries, including Bulgaria, have experienced cyclical increases in scarlet fever and invasive group A streptococcal disease since 2022; the current week’s figures suggest a return toward baseline incidence.\n\n\nCOVID-19: Stable Low-Level Circulation\nThirty-four confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, virtually unchanged from 33 cases during the equivalent 2025 period and identical to the preceding week. This represents continued low-level endemic circulation without signals of substantial wave activity.\n\n\n\nVector-Borne Transmission\n\nTick-Borne Diseases: Seasonal Trough\nLyme borreliosis recorded 3 confirmed cases (Sofia city and Haskovo region) during Week 01, a slight decrease from 4 cases in the same 2025 period. The winter period represents the seasonal trough for tick-borne infections in Bulgaria, with Ixodes ricinus activity substantially reduced during cold months. No cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, or West Nile fever were reported, consistent with vector seasonality.\n\n\n\nContact and Sexual Transmission\n\nSyphilis: Four-Fold Year-Over-Year Increase\nFour confirmed syphilis cases were reported during Week 01, representing a 300% increase compared to the single case in the equivalent 2025 period and an increase of 1 case from the preceding week. While small absolute numbers limit statistical inference, this signal aligns with broader European trends of increasing syphilis incidence, particularly among men who have sex with men and in association with HIV co-infection.\nSyphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, progresses through primary (chancre), secondary (rash, mucocutaneous lesions), latent, and potentially tertiary stages affecting cardiovascular and neurological systems. The incubation period averages 21 days (range 10–90 days). Congenital syphilis through vertical transmission causes severe fetal and neonatal morbidity; notably, no congenital syphilis cases were reported this week compared to 1 case in the same 2025 period.\n\n\nOther Sexually Transmitted Infections\nSingle cases each of gonorrhoea and urogenital chlamydial infection were reported, consistent with prior-year figures. No new HIV diagnoses were registered during Week 01, compared to 10 cases in the preceding week, likely reflecting reporting lag associated with the holiday period.\n\n\n\nNeuroinvasive Infections\nOne confirmed case of viral meningitis/meningoencephalitis was reported in Lovech region, a decrease from 3 cases during the same period in 2025. A single probable case of bacterial meningitis (unspecified aetiology) was documented in Ruse. No cases of pneumococcal, streptococcal, or Haemophilus influenzae meningitis were reported, compared to 1 pneumococcal and 1 H. influenzae case during the equivalent 2025 period. No invasive meningococcal disease was registered.\n\nReport compiled from: Bulgarian National Centre for Public Health and Analyses weekly surveillance data (Week 01/2026); WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record No. 52, 26 December 2025; EMA PRAC recommendations on signals, November 2025 meeting."

    "text": "Week 5 of 2026 presents four epidemiologically significant developments requiring immediate public health attention. First, Bulgaria’s acute viral hepatitis notifications reached 185 cumulative cases through Week 5, representing a 198% increase over the 62 cases reported during the same period in 2025, with 43 cases in Week 5 alone—a signal demanding urgent virological investigation to identify causative agents and transmission pathways. Second, campylobacteriosis in Bulgaria showed a 193% year-over-year increase (44 cases versus 15 cases), suggesting potential food safety breaches or environmental contamination requiring immediate investigation. Third, the European Medicines Agency approved Kayshild (semaglutide) as the first GLP-1 receptor agonist for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis, addressing a condition with no previously authorised pharmacological treatment and significant implications for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease management across Europe. Fourth, the Netherlands reported avian influenza A(H5N1) antibodies in a dairy cow—the first such detection in the EU/EEA and only the second country globally after the United States to identify cattle exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza, raising concerns about potential mammalian adaptation and zoonotic transmission pathways beyond poultry."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\nNipah virus disease emerged as an immediate public health concern during Week 5, with India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare confirming two cases in West Bengal state on 27 January 2026. Both confirmed cases are healthcare workers employed at the same hospital in the district of North 24 Parganas, near Kolkata. Media reporting, citing health authorities, indicated a total of five Nipah virus disease cases at the hospital, though only two received laboratory confirmation through official surveillance systems. According to media accounts, both nurses had provided direct patient care to an individual presenting with symptoms consistent with Nipah virus infection, suggesting nosocomial transmission through inadequate infection prevention and control measures during patient management. One nurse reportedly travelled to a village in Nadia district near the Bangladesh border and may have consumed raw date palm sap, a recognised transmission pathway for Nipah virus through contamination of sap collection vessels by bat urine or saliva from infected Pteropus fruit bat reservoir hosts. This exposure history, while reported in media accounts, has not been confirmed through official public health communications. As of 27 January 2026, a total of 196 contacts of the confirmed cases completed testing with negative results, according to India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\nWest Bengal has documented previous Nipah virus disease outbreaks in Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia district in 2007, establishing the state as an area with documented viral circulation and appropriate ecological conditions supporting bat reservoir populations. During 2025, India reported four Nipah virus disease cases from Palakkad district (two cases) and Malappuram district (two cases) in Kerala state, with two deaths, both occurring in Palakkad district. The emergence of cases in West Bengal, geographically distant from the Kerala focus, raises questions regarding viral geographic distribution, reservoir host ecology, and surveillance sensitivity across different Indian states.\nNipah virus, classified as Henipavirus nipahense within the family Paramyxoviridae, is a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus first identified during a 1999 outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore. The natural reservoir comprises Pteropus fruit bats distributed across South and Southeast Asia. Human infection occurs through direct contact with infected bats or their excretions, consumption of food contaminated by bat saliva or urine—particularly raw date palm sap collected in vessels that bats may access—contact with infected domestic animals particularly pigs, or person-to-person transmission through direct contact with infected individuals or respiratory secretions. The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days. Clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic infection or mild influenza-like illness through severe respiratory disease to acute encephalitis. Patients may present with fever, headache, myalgia, and vomiting progressing to altered mental status, seizures, and coma. Respiratory involvement ranges from mild cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Case fatality rates vary by outbreak from 40% to 75%, reflecting differences in viral strain virulence, transmission routes, healthcare capacity, and case ascertainment. No specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for Nipah virus disease; clinical management is supportive, including mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and intensive care for encephalitis. The lack of effective therapeutics combined with person-to-person transmission capability and high case fatality rates establish Nipah virus as a Priority Pathogen for Research and Development under the World Health Organisation’s prioritisation framework.\nNeighbouring countries initiated precautionary measures following the West Bengal cases. Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, and other countries bordering or with substantial air traffic connections to India implemented information campaigns and screening protocols for passengers arriving from India at international airports. These measures reflect the recognised potential for international spread through infected travellers during the incubation period before symptom onset. However, the likelihood of exposure to and infection with Nipah virus for EU/EEA citizens travelling to or residing in India remains very low, given the limited number of infections identified to date, the focal geographic distribution of cases, and the specific exposure pathways required for transmission. The most likely route for viral introduction into the EU/EEA would be an infected traveller during the incubation period or early symptomatic phase, though this likelihood is currently very low. Even if importation occurred, the absence of natural reservoir hosts in Europe, combined with robust healthcare infection prevention and control capacity and surveillance systems, would substantially limit transmission potential. Therefore, the overall risk for the EU/EEA population is assessed as very low in the current epidemiological context.\nEU/EEA travellers and residents in West Bengal should observe general precautions against zoonotic disease transmission. These include avoiding handling or close contact with domestic or wild animals, avoiding contact with animal excreta, and not consuming raw date palm sap, which may be contaminated by bat saliva or urine during collection. Washing, peeling, and cooking fruits and vegetables before consumption provides general protection against foodborne pathogens. Healthcare workers providing clinical care in areas with Nipah virus circulation should implement standard, contact, and droplet precautions, with consideration of airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures, given documented nosocomial transmission in previous outbreaks."

    "text": "Vector-Borne Transmission\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) surveillance in mammals revealed a significant development on 23 January 2026 when authorities in the Netherlands reported detection of antibodies against avian influenza A(H5N1) in milk from a dairy cow at a farm in Friesland province. This represents the first detection of cattle exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza in the European Union/European Economic Area and only the second country globally, after the United States, to identify serological evidence of infection in domestic cattle. The detection followed investigation of an avian influenza A(H5N1) infection in a domestic cat at the same dairy farm in December 2025. Following the feline case, 20 dairy cattle underwent random sampling on 15 January 2026 with testing for avian influenza A(H5N1) conducted at Wageningen Bioveterinary Research. Diagnostic testing found no active viral shedding in milk samples from any of the 20 cattle, but one cow demonstrated antibodies against avian influenza virus based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Luminex testing, indicating previous exposure and immune response. The seropositive cow experienced mastitis in mid-December 2025, and milk from this cow was excluded from the human food chain during the period of clinical disease. All milk from the farm undergoes pasteurisation before distribution, a thermal process that inactivates influenza viruses.\nFollowing detection of the seropositive animal, all dairy cattle at the farm underwent sampling on 22 January 2026 with testing for active avian influenza A(H5N1) virus; all results were negative. Serological testing for antibodies against avian influenza virus in the complete herd was ongoing at the time of reporting, with results pending. Currently, no indication exists of active viral circulation within the dairy herd or transmission to other farms in the region. Farm personnel and the attending veterinarian were offered polymerase chain reaction testing and serological testing for A(H5N1) by the Municipal Health Service, with results pending at the time of reporting. None of the exposed individuals reported recent symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection.\nThe viral isolate from the domestic cat, submitted to the GISAID database on 7 January 2026 with collection date 24 December 2025 and designated A/Domestic cat/Netherlands/25021875-005/2025, belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype EA2024-DI, subgroup DI.2. All highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses detected in avian species in Europe since 2016 belong to clade 2.3.4.4b, and during the 2024–2025 epidemiological year, DI.2 emerged as the most frequent and geographically widespread genotype among highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses circulating in the region. Phylogenetic analysis positioned the feline isolate within a branch containing other DI.2 strains collected from wild and captive birds in Europe during 2025, including strains from wild birds in the Netherlands. The feline isolate demonstrates one nucleotide difference in the haemagglutinin gene segment compared to avian strains within this phylogenetic branch. Significantly, the isolate acquired the E627K substitution in the PB2 polymerase segment, an amino acid change strongly associated with enhanced viral polymerase activity in mammalian cells. This mutation appears in approximately 47% of mammalian isolates but fewer than 1% of avian isolates, reflecting its role in adaptation to mammalian hosts. The presence of this mutation in the feline isolate raises questions regarding the viral population infecting cattle at the farm and whether similar adaptive mutations are present.\nThe detection of avian influenza A(H5N1) antibodies in cattle raises important questions regarding mammalian adaptation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and potential for establishment of mammalian reservoir hosts beyond poultry. The United States documented widespread highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) circulation in dairy cattle beginning in March 2024, with subsequent human infections in farm workers through direct exposure to infected cattle or contaminated environments. All human cases in the United States experienced mild symptoms, primarily conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms, without requiring hospitalisation. Transmission of avian influenza virus via pasteurised milk and dairy products is considered highly unlikely, given that pasteurisation temperatures exceed the thermal inactivation threshold for influenza viruses.\nThe risk assessment for EU/EEA populations depends on clarification of several uncertainties. The extent of cattle exposure at the affected farm remains unclear pending completion of herd-wide serological testing. Whether the index cat and affected cow were infected from a common environmental source—such as contaminated feed, water, or contact with infected wild birds—or whether cross-species transmission occurred between species on the farm requires investigation. The viral characteristics of isolates from cattle, if virus can be recovered from archived samples, would clarify whether viruses circulating in cattle carry mammalian adaptation markers similar to the feline isolate. With currently available information, the risk from avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses currently circulating in Europe is assessed as low for the general population and low to moderate for individuals with occupational or other exposure to infected animals, including cattle, or contaminated environments. Enhanced surveillance, active monitoring and testing of exposed individuals, risk-based testing of symptomatic individuals with animal exposure, and implementation of appropriate personal protective equipment and biosecurity measures for workers in contact with potentially infected animals remain essential public health responses."

    "text": "Bloodborne and Tissue Transmission\nThe Marburg virus disease outbreak in Ethiopia was officially declared over on 26 January 2026, following completion of a 42-day period—equivalent to two maximum incubation periods—without detection of new cases since the death of the last laboratory-confirmed case on 14 December 2025. This declaration marks the successful conclusion of Ethiopia’s first documented Marburg virus disease outbreak, which was identified on 14 November 2025.\nThe outbreak comprised 19 cases (14 laboratory-confirmed and five probable) of Marburg virus disease across four woredas in two regions: Jinka, Malle, and Dasenech woredas in South Ethiopia Regional State, and Hawassa in Sidama Region. Jinka town served as the epidemiological epicentre. The outbreak resulted in 14 deaths (nine among laboratory-confirmed cases and five among probable cases), yielding a case fatality rate of 64.3% among confirmed cases—consistent with historical Marburg virus disease mortality. Five patients recovered from laboratory-confirmed infection, representing a 29.4% recovery rate.\nThe first recognised case was an adult from Jinka town who developed symptoms on 23 October 2025 and presented to the General Hospital on 24 October 2025 with vomiting, abdominal cramps, and anorexia. Clinical presentation across the case series included sudden-onset fever, myalgia, severe fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, and in later disease stages, unexplained haemorrhage—manifestations consistent with filovirus disease pathophysiology. The outbreak investigation revealed subsequent cases among healthcare workers, family contacts, and community members, establishing multiple transmission chains requiring intensive contact tracing and monitoring.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, a total of 857 listed contacts completed their 21-day monitoring period: 760 contacts in South Ethiopia Regional State and 97 contacts in Sidama Region. Contact tracing and monitoring represent cornerstone interventions for filovirus outbreak control, enabling early case detection, isolation, and interruption of transmission chains. The absence of new cases among this substantial contact cohort through the completion of monitoring provides confidence in outbreak containment.\nResponse activities included implementation of the cAd3-Marburg vaccine trial, initiated on 8 December 2025 in both affected regions. Ethiopia received 2,500 doses of the candidate vaccine and prioritised healthcare professionals and case contacts for vaccination, implementing a ring vaccination strategy around confirmed cases. This represented the first field deployment of an investigational Marburg virus vaccine in an outbreak context, providing critical data on feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness for future outbreak response. Additionally, monoclonal antibody treatment was implemented for cases, representing experimental therapy given the absence of approved antiviral treatments for Marburg virus disease. Community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding were intensified to detect additional cases. International partners including the World Health Organisation, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and epidemic response organisations provided technical and logistical support.\nIn December 2025, during Ethiopia’s outbreak, three deaths reported in South Sudan raised concern for possible transboundary spread, and an alert was issued in Wajaale, a major border city in the Somaliland region. Neighbouring countries including South Sudan, Kenya, and Somalia intensified preparedness efforts including enhancement of surveillance systems, training of healthcare workers in infection prevention and control, and establishment of isolation capacity for suspected cases.\nMarburg virus disease, caused by Marburg marburgvirus, is a severe haemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates historically reaching 88% in some outbreaks. The virus belongs to the family Filoviridae, genus Marburgvirus, closely related to Ebola virus. Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) serve as the natural reservoir host, with human infections typically initiated through exposure to mines or caves inhabited by infected bat colonies. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected individuals, and with surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids. The incubation period ranges from three to 21 days, typically five to 10 days. Clinical disease begins abruptly with high fever, severe headache, and malaise, progressing to severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting by days three to five. Haemorrhagic manifestations including bleeding from venepuncture sites, gastrointestinal bleeding, and mucosal bleeding typically appear by days five to seven in fatal cases. Case fatality depends on viral strain virulence, transmission intensity, timing of supportive care initiation, and healthcare infrastructure capacity. No specific antiviral treatment or approved vaccine exists for Marburg virus disease; clinical management is supportive, including fluid and electrolyte replacement, maintenance of oxygen status and blood pressure, and treatment of specific complications.\nThe successful containment of Ethiopia’s outbreak demonstrates the effectiveness of rapid outbreak response, comprehensive contact tracing, healthcare worker protection through infection prevention and control, community engagement, and international coordination. The integration of investigational vaccines and therapeutics into outbreak response represents an important evolution in filovirus outbreak management, building on experience from West African Ebola outbreak responses. The declaration of outbreak’s end does not eliminate risk of future zoonotic transmission events, given the continued presence of reservoir bat populations in the region and human activities bringing populations into contact with bat habitats."

    "text": "Fecal-Oral Transmission\nGlobal cholera surveillance documented continued widespread transmission across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East during the reporting period. Since 24 December 2025 and as of 28 January 2026, 11,965 new cholera cases including 126 deaths were reported globally. The five countries reporting the highest case counts were the Democratic Republic of the Congo (4,522 cases), Afghanistan (3,029 cases), Yemen (1,144 cases), Mozambique (896 cases), and India (878 cases). The five countries reporting the most deaths were the Democratic Republic of the Congo (89 deaths), the Philippines (14 deaths), India (six deaths), Yemen (five deaths), and Côte d’Ivoire (four deaths).\nSince 1 January 2026 and as of 27 January 2026, eight countries reported 1,203 cholera cases including seven deaths: Angola (152 cases, two deaths), Burundi (23 cases), Ethiopia (15 cases), Malawi (12 cases, two deaths), Mozambique (896 cases, three deaths), Namibia (18 cases), Somalia (82 cases), and Zambia (five cases). This represents an 88% decrease compared to the 10,043 cases including 32 deaths reported during the equivalent period in 2025 across all reporting countries globally. However, interpretation requires caution given reporting delays and the January timing, when many surveillance systems experience reduced reporting intensity following year-end transitions and holiday periods.\nIn southern Africa, Mozambique’s 896 cases since 1 January 2026 indicate sustained transmission, likely driven by inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, seasonal rainfall affecting water sources, and population displacement. Angola’s emergence with 152 cases represents renewed cholera transmission requiring investigation of water supply contamination, sanitation breakdowns, or population movements. Malawi, Namibia, and Zambia each reported small case numbers suggesting either successful outbreak control or early-phase transmission requiring vigilance.\nAfghanistan continues experiencing intense cholera transmission with 3,029 cases reported between 8 December 2025 and 28 December 2025. Afghanistan’s ongoing humanitarian crisis, characterised by widespread displacement, collapse of water and sanitation infrastructure, malnutrition, and limited healthcare access, creates optimal conditions for cholera transmission. Cumulative 2025 data through 28 December documented 164,820 cases and 80 deaths, nearly matching the 175,262 cases and 88 deaths reported during the equivalent 2024 period, demonstrating sustained endemic transmission at crisis levels.\nYemen reported 1,144 new cases including five deaths between 1 December 2025 and 28 December 2025. Yemen’s protracted conflict has devastated water and sanitation infrastructure, displaced millions, and created widespread acute malnutrition, establishing conditions for cholera hyperendemicity. Cumulative 2025 data through 23 December documented 93,496 cases and 248 deaths, representing a 64% decrease compared to the 260,552 cases and 879 deaths reported during 2024, though Yemen continues experiencing one of the world’s largest cholera epidemics.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 4,522 new cases including 89 deaths were reported between 24 December 2025 and 31 December 2025, maintaining the extraordinarily high transmission intensity characterising this outbreak. Cumulative 2025 data through 31 December documented 71,646 cases and 2,028 deaths, representing a 150% increase compared to the 28,618 cases and 385 deaths reported through November 2024. The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s epidemic reflects a combination of deteriorating water and sanitation infrastructure, population displacement due to armed conflict, inadequate healthcare capacity, and breakdown of cholera prevention and control programmes. The extremely high case fatality rate among reported deaths suggests delayed presentation to healthcare facilities, limited access to oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluid resuscitation, and potentially high prevalence of severe acute malnutrition increasing cholera severity.\nThe global cholera situation reflects the persistent gap between oral cholera vaccine supply and demand. The Global Oral Cholera Vaccine Stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision, has implemented temporary suspension of the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in favour of single-dose campaigns to extend coverage across more populations at risk. While this decision maximises short-term coverage, single-dose protection wanes more rapidly than two-dose regimens, potentially requiring booster campaigns that further strain limited vaccine supplies. Expansion of oral cholera vaccine manufacturing capacity represents a critical priority for global cholera control.\nFor EU/EEA populations, cholera risk remains low even during travel to affected regions, provided travellers follow water, sanitation, and food hygiene precautions. These include consuming only boiled or bottled water, avoiding ice unless made from safe water, eating thoroughly cooked food served hot, avoiding raw vegetables and fruits unless peeled by the traveller, and practising frequent handwashing with soap and safe water. Oral cholera vaccine is recommended for higher-risk travellers including emergency response workers, healthcare personnel working in outbreak settings, and individuals travelling to areas experiencing active transmission who anticipate limited access to safe water and sanitation. The vaccine is not recommended for typical tourists staying in standard accommodations."

    "text": "Contact and Sexual Transmission\nBacillus cereus contamination of infant formula emerged as a significant food safety concern during December 2025 and continued into January 2026, with ongoing product recalls across multiple countries including EU/EEA Member States. The contamination involved detection of cereulide, the emetic toxin produced by specific Bacillus cereus strains, in several infant nutrition products spanning different batches, product formulations, and brand names. The precautionary recall, initiated in December 2025 and continuing through January 2026, followed company quality control testing that identified cereulide presence. Root cause analysis by the manufacturer identified arachidonic acid oil—an ingredient added to infant formula to provide long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supporting infant neurodevelopment—as the contamination source.\nBacillus cereus comprises a group of Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria widely distributed in soil and environmental reservoirs. The bacterium produces two distinct toxin syndromes. The diarrhoeal syndrome, mediated by enterotoxins produced during vegetative growth in the small intestine, typically manifests 8 to 16 hours after ingestion with abdominal cramps and watery diarrhoea. The emetic syndrome, mediated by cereulide—a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide synthesised during bacterial growth in food—manifests within one to six hours after ingestion with nausea and vomiting, occasionally accompanied by abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. Cereulide demonstrates extraordinary thermostability, remaining active after exposure to 121°C for 90 minutes, substantially exceeding the thermal inactivation conditions for most bacterial toxins. This thermostability enables cereulide persistence through food processing conditions that eliminate vegetative bacterial cells and many other toxins.\nCereulide acts as a potassium ionophore, disrupting mitochondrial function and cellular ion gradients. In severe cases, particularly involving high toxin doses or vulnerable populations, cereulide causes fulminant hepatic failure characterised by massively elevated transaminases, coagulopathy, hypoglycaemia, and hyperammonaemia progressing to hepatic encephalopathy. Fatalities have been documented, particularly in young children. The toxin also demonstrates cardiotoxicity, potentially causing arrhythmias. Neonates and young infants may be particularly vulnerable to cereulide toxicity given their developing hepatic detoxification capacity, limited metabolic reserves, and dependence on formula feeding without dietary diversity that might dilute toxin exposure.\nEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control received reports of diarrhoea in infants following consumption of recalled products. One laboratory-confirmed case involved detection of cereulide in a faecal sample from a young infant using mass spectrometry, a highly specific analytical method for cereulide quantification. The infant had consumed milk prepared from a recalled batch of formula and presented with vomiting and diarrhoea, achieving favourable clinical outcome without reported complications. This case provides strong evidence linking product consumption to clinical illness, though the rarity of cereulide detection in clinical specimens limits understanding of disease burden. Additionally, formula sampled from an unopened container from a recalled batch, collected from the household of an infant reporting symptoms after consumption, tested positive for cereulide toxin, providing product-level confirmation of contamination.\nThe affected products experienced wide distribution across EU/EEA countries and globally, creating substantial exposure opportunity for infants consuming these formulations. National food safety authorities initiated product withdrawals and recalls, advised consumers to discontinue use of affected products, and implemented enhanced surveillance for potential cases. The likelihood of exposure to contaminated formula batches was initially moderate to high for infants consuming the affected brands and formulations, though ongoing recalls progressively reduced exposure likelihood. The impact of potential cereulide exposure varies by infant age, with neonates and infants younger than six months potentially experiencing higher risk of severe manifestations including dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and hepatotoxicity, compared to older infants with more developed hepatic metabolism and ability to tolerate fluid losses. Therefore, the overall risk to infants less than one year in the EU/EEA was initially assessed as moderate during the height of exposure, decreasing as recall completion progressed.\nThis incident highlights critical food safety challenges in infant formula manufacturing, where products must achieve microbiological safety while supporting optimal infant nutrition. The thermostability of cereulide presents particular challenges, as standard pasteurisation and sterilisation processes that eliminate bacterial cells do not inactivate pre-formed toxin. Prevention requires controlling bacterial growth in ingredients throughout the supply chain, particularly ingredients like vegetable oils that may support bacterial growth if contaminated and held at temperatures permitting sporulation and toxin production. Enhanced supplier qualification, ingredient testing for cereulide, and process validation to prevent cross-contamination represent essential control measures."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\nInfluenza activity across the EU/EEA remained elevated throughout Week 3 of 2026—the most recent week with comprehensive surveillance data available—with early indications of renewed intensification following a four-week period of declining trends from the initial epidemic peak in late 2025. According to the European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary, 20 of 23 reporting countries continued experiencing widespread geographic influenza transmission, defined as influenza activity affecting multiple regions within countries. Influenza virus detections in sentinel primary care surveillance yielded a pooled test positivity of 37%, with median country-level positivity of 40% and interquartile range of 23% to 55%. This sustained high positivity indicates continued intense viral circulation despite the four-week decline following the late-2025 peak. Sentinel hospital surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection documented influenza test positivity of 25%, with median country-level positivity of 18% and interquartile range of 14% to 38%, indicating substantial proportions of hospitalised patients with severe respiratory illness have influenza virus infection.\nThe renewed increase in primary care consultations for influenza-like illness and acute respiratory infection, following the four-week declining trend, predominantly affects children aged five to 14 years, suggesting either renewed transmission within school-age populations or shifting age-specific epidemic dynamics as older age groups develop immunity through infection or vaccination. Conversely, overall influenza-associated hospital admissions continued declining compared to previous weeks, though recent data demonstrated increases specifically among hospitalised children aged five to 14 years, mirroring the primary care pattern. This age-specific increase among hospitalised children warrants monitoring to assess whether paediatric hospital admissions will intensify in coming weeks, potentially straining paediatric hospital capacity.\nAdults aged 65 years and above continue accounting for the highest absolute numbers of influenza-associated hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, and in-hospital deaths during the 2025/2026 season. This age distribution reflects the well-established pattern of severe influenza outcomes concentrating in older adults due to immunosenescence, multimorbidity, and reduced physiological reserve. The substantial mortality burden in this age group during an influenza season beginning three to four weeks earlier than the previous two seasons underscores the importance of achieving high influenza vaccination coverage in older adults and other high-risk populations before seasonal epidemic onset.\nVirological surveillance indicates influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant circulating subtype, representing 72% of typed influenza A viruses during Week 4 of 2026. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounts for 28% of typed influenza A viruses. Influenza B viruses represent less than 1% of influenza detections, indicating minimal influenza B circulation during the current epidemic period. Among genetically characterised influenza A(H3N2) viruses, subclade 2a.3a.1(K) accounts for 92% of sequenced viruses, with subclades 2a.3a.1(J.2), 2a.3a.1(J.2.4), and 2a.3a.1(J.2.2) representing small proportions. Among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, subclade 5a.2a.1(D.3.1) represents 99% of sequenced viruses. Among the small number of influenza B viruses, B/Victoria lineage viruses predominate.\nEarly estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness for the 2025/2026 season, published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on 19 December 2025, align with estimates published by other countries for influenza A(H3N2) viruses. These interim estimates provide reassurance that vaccine strain selection for the Northern Hemisphere 2025/2026 season achieved reasonable antigenic match to circulating viruses, though final season-end vaccine effectiveness estimates will provide definitive assessment. Given the substantial mortality burden in older adults during the current season, maximising vaccination coverage in this population and other high-risk groups remains a public health priority, even though vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) typically demonstrates lower magnitude compared to effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.\nRespiratory syncytial virus circulation is elevated and continues increasing in most EU/EEA countries. This season’s RSV epidemic is occurring several weeks later than the previous two seasons, following a pattern of substantial inter-seasonal variability in RSV epidemic timing observed across multiple Northern Hemisphere regions. RSV test positivity in sentinel primary care surveillance reached 10%, with median country-level positivity of 7.2% and interquartile range of 4.5% to 12%. Sentinel hospital surveillance documented RSV test positivity of 15%, with median country-level positivity of 12% and interquartile range of 8% to 20%. Hospital admissions associated with RSV are rising in most reporting countries, primarily affecting children aged under five years, particularly infants aged under six months who experience the highest rates of RSV-associated hospitalisation and severe disease. Among genotyped RSV strains, RSV-A accounts for 50% and RSV-B accounts for 50% of typed detections, indicating co-circulation of both major RSV subtypes.\nThe delayed onset of this season’s RSV epidemic relative to recent years has implications for immunisation programmes utilising long-acting monoclonal antibodies for RSV prevention in infants. Programmes administering nirsevimab—a long-acting monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV fusion protein—typically aim to achieve protection before seasonal epidemic onset. The shifted epidemic timing may have resulted in better temporal alignment between monoclonal antibody administration and peak transmission intensity in countries that administered nirsevimab during autumn 2025. Evaluation of nirsevimab effectiveness during the current season will provide important data on real-world protection and inform optimal timing for future RSV prevention programmes.\nSARS-CoV-2 circulation remains low across the EU/EEA in all age groups. SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in sentinel primary care surveillance measured 2.9%, with median country-level positivity of 3% and interquartile range of 0.3% to 6.2%. Sentinel hospital surveillance documented SARS-CoV-2 test positivity of 2.5%, with median country-level positivity of 1% and interquartile range of 0% to 2.8%. The number of hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited compared to influenza and RSV, indicating SARS-CoV-2 is not a major contributor to current healthcare system burden. Among sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the XEC recombinant variant accounts for 48% of detections (median distribution across reporting countries 27% to 50%), NB.1.8.1 accounts for 23% of detections (median 20% to 27%), and BA.2.86 descendant lineages account for small proportions.\nEuroMOMO, the European mortality monitoring system, reports substantially elevated all-cause mortality levels across participating countries, primarily driven by increased mortality in several countries among age groups above 65 years. Excess mortality during winter months typically reflects contributions from influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, other respiratory pathogens, cardiovascular events exacerbated by cold temperature or respiratory infections, and healthcare system strain. The concentration of excess mortality in populations aged 65 years and above aligns with the observed influenza epidemiology, where older adults experience the highest rates of influenza-associated hospitalisation and death. The substantial excess mortality during a season characterised by early influenza epidemic onset and high influenza A(H3N2) circulation—a subtype historically associated with greater severity in older adults compared to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09—underscores the continued substantial public health burden of seasonal influenza despite available interventions.\nThe 2025/2026 influenza season’s early onset, occurring three to four weeks ahead of the previous two seasons, caught some healthcare systems and vaccination programmes during vaccine delivery, potentially resulting in lower proportions of at-risk populations protected before epidemic onset. The convergence of high influenza activity, increasing RSV circulation, and elevated all-cause mortality creates substantial healthcare system pressure, particularly affecting hospital capacity for older adults requiring admission for respiratory complications, cardiac decompensation, or other influenza-associated severe outcomes.\nPublic health priorities include sustaining influenza vaccination delivery to protect individuals not yet vaccinated, maintaining healthcare system surge capacity for respiratory illness, implementing appropriate infection prevention and control in healthcare settings to prevent nosocomial transmission, and ensuring availability of influenza antiviral medications for treatment of severe cases and post-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk settings. Healthcare providers should maintain high index of suspicion for influenza in patients presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness, particularly in older adults and other high-risk populations, and initiate antiviral treatment promptly based on clinical and epidemiological judgment without awaiting laboratory confirmation, given that early antiviral treatment—ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset—provides greatest benefit."

    "text": "Respiratory and Droplet Transmission\nVaricella surveillance during Week 5 documented 558 cases, representing a 13.2% decline from the 632 cases reported during Week 4 and continuing the downward trajectory from the 650-case peak reported in Week 3. Varicella cases were distributed across 27 of 28 Bulgarian regions, with highest absolute case counts in Sofia-capital (122 cases), Plovdiv (58 cases), Haskovo (48 cases), Varna (60 cases), Burgas (40 cases), and Blagoevgrad (35 cases). The geographic distribution reflects population density, with larger urban centres accounting for higher absolute case counts. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria registered 2,885 cumulative varicella cases compared to 3,343 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 13.7% decline year-over-year. This decrease may reflect cohort effects from previous epidemic years, natural immunity accumulation in susceptible age groups, or potentially increased varicella vaccination coverage, though Bulgaria’s varicella vaccination coverage data require examination to assess programmatic impact.\nVaricella, caused by varicella-zoster virus, a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus of the family Herpesviridae, typically affects children aged one to nine years, manifesting as acute febrile illness with characteristic pruritic vesicular rash progressing through stages of macules, papules, vesicles, and crusting. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets or direct contact with vesicular fluid from skin lesions. The virus establishes latency in dorsal root ganglia following primary infection, with reactivation as herpes zoster occurring decades later, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and adults over 50 years. Varicella vaccination, incorporated into national immunisation schedules in many countries, has substantially reduced varicella incidence where high coverage is achieved. Bulgaria introduced varicella vaccination into its recommended schedule, though coverage levels and vaccine uptake patterns influence population-level impact.\nCOVID-19 surveillance documented 36 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, representing minimal change from the 37 cases reported during Week 4. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 215 cumulative COVID-19 cases compared to 175 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 23% year-over-year increase. However, interpretation requires caution given substantial changes in testing strategies, surveillance systems, and healthcare-seeking behaviour between 2025 and 2026. Bulgaria, like other European countries, transitioned from intensive universal surveillance during the acute pandemic phase toward sentinel surveillance and testing focused on hospitalised patients and high-risk populations, substantially reducing case ascertainment of mild or asymptomatic infections. The 36 weekly cases likely represent severe fraction requiring hospitalisation or testing through sentinel systems rather than comprehensive community transmission burden. SARS-CoV-2 continues circulating endemically across Bulgaria and Europe, with periodic fluctuations in transmission intensity influenced by waning population immunity, emergence of immune-escape variants, seasonal factors favouring respiratory virus transmission, and population behaviour affecting contact rates.\nScarlet fever surveillance documented 66 cases during Week 5, a 17.5% decline from the 80 cases reported during Week 4 and maintaining a relatively stable trajectory following the early-2026 peak. Cases distributed across 18 regions, with highest counts in Sofia-capital (16 cases), Plovdiv (13 cases), and Varna (6 cases). Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria registered 279 cumulative scarlet fever cases compared to 484 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 42.4% decrease year-over-year. This substantial decline warrants attention to assess whether it reflects true reduction in group A Streptococcus pyogenes transmission, changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour or clinical diagnosis patterns, or other surveillance-related factors.\nScarlet fever manifests as a toxin-mediated syndrome caused by group A Streptococcus pyogenes strains producing streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, most commonly erythrogenic toxin. The disease typically affects children aged five to 15 years, presenting with acute pharyngitis, fever, and characteristic erythematous rash with sandpaper texture, circumoral pallor, and strawberry tongue. The rash appears within 12 to 48 hours of fever onset, beginning on the trunk and spreading to extremities, sparing palms and soles, and desquamating during convalescence. While scarlet fever typically follows a benign clinical course with appropriate antibiotic treatment, group A Streptococcus pyogenes can cause severe invasive disease including bacteraemia, necrotising fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, as well as post-infectious sequelae including acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The decline in scarlet fever notifications during early 2026 contrasts with increases in invasive group A Streptococcus disease reported in some European countries during recent years, highlighting the importance of monitoring both non-invasive and invasive manifestations of group A streptococcal infection."

    "text": "Fecal-Oral Transmission\nGastroenteritis and enterocolitis surveillance documented 101 cases during Week 5, representing a 14.4% decline from the 118 cases reported during Week 4. Cases were distributed across 23 regions, with highest counts in Varna (20 cases), Plovdiv (11 cases), and Sofia-capital (11 cases). Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria registered 650 cumulative gastroenteritis cases, identical to the 650 cases reported during the equivalent period in 2025, indicating stable endemic baseline transmission. This stability suggests consistent levels of foodborne, waterborne, and person-to-person transmission of enteric pathogens during the winter period, when norovirus, rotavirus, and other viral agents typically dominate acute gastroenteritis aetiology.\nAcute gastroenteritis encompasses a broad syndrome caused by diverse bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Viral agents—particularly norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus—predominate in community-acquired acute gastroenteritis, especially during winter months. Bacterial causes include Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, enterotoxigenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, and Yersinia. Clinical presentation typically includes acute onset of diarrhoea with variable accompanying features including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, fever, and systemic symptoms. Most cases are self-limited, resolving within days without specific antimicrobial therapy. Management focuses on oral rehydration, with intravenous fluid replacement reserved for severe dehydration. Populations at highest risk for severe outcomes include young children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. The stable gastroenteritis burden during early 2026 indicates that while specific etiological agents show variation—with campylobacteriosis dramatically increasing and rotavirus substantially decreasing, as discussed below—overall gastroenteritis burden remains within expected endemic range.\nRotavirus gastroenteritis surveillance documented 13 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, maintaining a stable low level following the decline from early January peaks. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 54 cumulative rotavirus cases compared to 123 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 56.1% decline year-over-year. This substantial decrease likely reflects expanding rotavirus vaccination coverage in Bulgaria. Rotavirus vaccines—both the pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine and the monovalent human attenuated vaccine—demonstrate high effectiveness in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis requiring hospitalisation. Introduction of rotavirus vaccination into national immunisation programmes in countries worldwide has resulted in dramatic reductions in rotavirus-associated hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and healthcare costs. Bulgaria’s rotavirus vaccination programme, introduced in recent years, appears to be achieving population-level impact.\nRotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus of the family Reoviridae, represents the leading cause of severe acute dehydrating gastroenteritis in unvaccinated infants and young children globally. The virus infects small intestinal enterocytes, causing villous atrophy and malabsorption, resulting in severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, and rapid dehydration. Infants and children aged six months to two years experience highest severe disease rates. Transmission occurs via fecal-oral route through person-to-person contact, contaminated surfaces and fomites, and potentially aerosolised droplets. The virus demonstrates remarkable environmental stability and low infectious dose. Prior to vaccine introduction, rotavirus caused nearly universal infection by age five, with most children experiencing multiple infections of decreasing severity. The substantial decline in rotavirus cases during 2026 represents a significant public health achievement, reducing paediatric hospitalisations, healthcare costs, and parental work absences due to childcare for ill children.\nCampylobacteriosis surveillance documented 14 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, doubling the seven cases reported during Week 4 and representing the highest weekly count since comprehensive surveillance implementation. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 44 cumulative campylobacteriosis cases compared to just 15 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 193% year-over-year increase. This dramatic surge requires urgent investigation to identify sources, transmission pathways, and risk factors. Campylobacteriosis demonstrates strong seasonality in temperate climates, with peak incidence during warmer months when foodborne transmission intensifies through undercooking of poultry, cross-contamination during food preparation, and temperature abuse of food storage. However, the current surge is occurring during winter months—outside the typical seasonal peak—suggesting potential outbreak scenarios including contaminated food products distributed across multiple regions, contaminated water sources, or point-source exposures at specific food establishments.\nCampylobacter species, particularly Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are Gram-negative spiral or curved bacilli representing the most common bacterial cause of acute gastroenteritis in many high-income countries. The bacteria colonise the intestinal tracts of diverse animal species, particularly poultry, cattle, pigs, and wild birds, without causing disease in these reservoir hosts. Human infection occurs primarily through consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk, contaminated water, or cross-contamination from raw poultry to ready-to-eat foods during food preparation. The incubation period ranges from one to seven days, typically two to five days. Clinical presentation includes acute onset of diarrhoea—often bloody with inflammatory character—accompanied by abdominal cramping, fever, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Most cases resolve spontaneously within one week without antimicrobial treatment. Severe cases may require antibiotic therapy, though increasing fluoroquinolone and macrolide resistance in Campylobacter populations complicates treatment. Post-infectious complications include reactive arthritis affecting one to five percent of cases, and Guillain-Barré syndrome—an acute immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy—affecting approximately one in 1,000 cases, typically developing two to three weeks after acute gastroenteritis onset.\nThe 193% year-over-year increase in campylobacteriosis demands immediate epidemiological investigation including case interviews to identify common food exposures, restaurant patronage, or other shared risk factors; traceback investigations of implicated food products to identify contamination sources; inspection of food establishments frequented by multiple cases; and microbiological testing of suspect food products, water sources, and environmental samples. Whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates from cases may identify genetic relatedness indicating common-source outbreak versus sporadic unrelated cases coincidentally clustered in time. Public health interventions may include food recalls if contaminated products are identified, temporary closure of food establishments with sanitation violations, public health advisories regarding safe food handling practices, and enhanced surveillance to detect additional cases.\nSalmonellosis surveillance documented 10 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, representing a single-case increase from the nine cases reported during Week 4 and maintaining a stable endemic baseline. Cases distributed across seven regions. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 55 cumulative salmonellosis cases compared to 46 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. While this increase is proportionally smaller than the campylobacteriosis surge, the absolute increase of nine cases warrants monitoring to assess whether salmonellosis transmission is intensifying or whether this represents normal stochastic variation around endemic baseline.\nNon-typhoidal Salmonella serovars cause acute gastroenteritis through foodborne and occasionally waterborne transmission. Reptiles and amphibians kept as pets represent another important transmission source, particularly for young children who handle these animals and subsequently engage in hand-to-mouth behaviour without adequate handwashing. Contaminated foods frequently implicated in salmonellosis include poultry, eggs and egg-containing products, raw milk and dairy products, beef, pork, fresh produce contaminated through irrigation water or food handler transmission, and spices. The incubation period ranges from six to 72 hours, typically 12 to 36 hours. Clinical presentation includes acute onset of diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, fever, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Bacteraemia develops in approximately five percent of cases, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. Extraintestinal focal infections may involve any organ system but particularly affect vascular endothelium—with mycotic aneurysms as a severe complication in older adults with atherosclerotic vascular disease—bone and joints, and meninges. Most immunocompetent individuals recover without antimicrobial treatment within five to seven days. Antibiotic therapy is reserved for severe cases, bacteraemia, extraintestinal infections, and patients at high risk for invasive disease including infants under three months, adults over 50 years, and immunocompromised individuals.\nDysentery surveillance documented one laboratory-confirmed case of shigellosis during Week 5, the first case reported since early January. The case represents sporadic transmission, likely through person-to-person contact or foodborne exposure. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded two cumulative shigellosis cases compared to one case during the equivalent period in 2025. Given the small absolute numbers, this represents expected endemic-level activity.\nShigella species—Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei—are Gram-negative enteroinvasive bacteria causing bacillary dysentery through invasion and destruction of colonic epithelium. The disease demonstrates extraordinary transmissibility with infectious doses as low as 10 to 100 organisms, enabling efficient person-to-person spread via fecal-oral route, particularly in settings with inadequate sanitation and hygiene. Foodborne and waterborne transmission also occurs. The incubation period ranges from one to three days. Clinical presentation includes acute onset of frequent small-volume stools containing blood and mucus, severe abdominal cramping and tenesmus, and fever. Complications include dehydration, toxic megacolon, seizures in young children, haemolytic uremic syndrome particularly with Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1, and reactive arthritis. Antibiotic treatment shortens illness duration and reduces faecal shedding. However, Shigella demonstrates concerning antimicrobial resistance patterns globally, including extensive drug resistance to multiple antibiotic classes and emerging resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin.\nEscherichia coli enteritis surveillance documented two laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, representing a 71.4% decline from the seven cases reported during Week 4. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 20 cumulative cases compared to 18 cases during the equivalent period in 2025. The decline following the Week 4 elevation suggests resolution of a transient cluster or outbreak.\nPathogenic Escherichia coli strains causing gastroenteritis are classified into multiple pathotypes based on virulence mechanisms: enterotoxigenic E. coli producing heat-labile and heat-stable toxins, enteroaggregative E. coli adhering to intestinal mucosa in aggregative patterns, enteropathogenic E. coli causing attaching-and-effacing lesions, enteroinvasive E. coli invading colonic epithelium similar to Shigella, and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli producing cytotoxic Shiga toxins. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, particularly serotype O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin-producing serotypes, cause haemorrhagic colitis manifesting as severe bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramping. The most serious complication is haemolytic uremic syndrome, characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia, affecting approximately five to ten percent of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli cases, particularly children under five years and older adults. Antibiotic treatment of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections is contraindicated as it may increase haemolytic uremic syndrome risk through enhanced Shiga toxin release. Bulgaria’s surveillance system distinguishes coliform enteritis cases, though virulence characterisation requires molecular or culture-based methods to classify pathotypes and guide public health responses appropriately."

    "text": "Bloodborne and Tissue Transmission\nAcute viral hepatitis surveillance documented 43 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, representing a 19.4% increase from the 36 cases reported during Week 4 and continuing the extraordinarily elevated notification rate characterising early 2026. Cases were distributed across 22 regions, with highest counts in Plovdiv (11 cases), Kardzhali (six cases), Varna (four cases), Dobrich (four cases), and Sofia-capital (four cases). The geographic distribution, affecting 22 of 28 Bulgarian regions, suggests widespread transmission rather than focal outbreak in a single region. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 185 cumulative acute viral hepatitis cases compared to 62 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 198% increase year-over-year—an extraordinary surge demanding urgent public health investigation and response.\nThis near-tripling of acute viral hepatitis notifications within five weeks compared to the previous year’s baseline represents one of the most significant epidemiological signals in Bulgaria’s Week 5 surveillance data. The magnitude and rapidity of increase, combined with the broad geographic distribution, raises multiple urgent questions regarding aetiology, transmission pathways, risk populations affected, and public health response requirements. The surveillance data reported by Bulgaria’s National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases document cases as acute viral hepatitis without virological characterisation specifying hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E aetiology, limiting aetiological inference.\nHowever, the epidemiological pattern—winter seasonality, rapid increase, broad geographic distribution—suggests several potential scenarios. First, hepatitis A transmission may be occurring through foodborne or waterborne exposure to faecally contaminated food products or water sources. Hepatitis A virus demonstrates marked seasonality in temperate climates with winter-spring peaks when transmission intensifies through contaminated food products—particularly fresh produce, shellfish, or frozen foods contaminated during processing—or person-to-person spread in households, childcare settings, and other close-contact environments. Bulgaria has documented hepatitis A outbreaks associated with contaminated food products in previous years, and the country’s hepatitis A vaccination coverage in childhood, while improving, may leave substantial susceptible populations at risk. Second, hepatitis E virus transmission could be increasing through consumption of undercooked pork products or game meat. Hepatitis E virus genotype 3, endemic in Europe, primarily transmits through zoonotic foodborne exposure to infected pork, wild boar, or deer products. Hepatitis E demonstrates winter seasonality in some European countries and can cause large outbreaks. Third, hepatitis B or hepatitis C transmission could be increasing through injection drug use, unsafe medical procedures, or other parenteral exposures. However, the rapid increase and winter timing make this scenario less likely as primary driver, though contributory role cannot be excluded. Fourth, imported cases from international travellers visiting hepatitis A-endemic regions could be contributing, though this would not explain the magnitude of increase unless multiple importation events seeded secondary transmission chains.\nHepatitis A virus, a non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Picornaviridae, transmits via fecal-oral route through person-to-person contact, contaminated food, or contaminated water. The virus demonstrates extraordinary environmental stability, surviving for months in water and on environmental surfaces. Following ingestion, the virus replicates in hepatocytes, is secreted into bile, and excreted in faeces at high concentrations beginning approximately one to two weeks before jaundice onset and continuing for one to two weeks after onset. The incubation period averages 28 to 30 days with range of 15 to 50 days. Clinical presentation varies by age: children under six years experience predominantly asymptomatic or mild non-specific illness, while older children and adults develop symptomatic disease characterised by acute onset of fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and jaundice. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase rise to 10 to 100 times upper limit of normal. The illness typically lasts several weeks with full recovery in most cases. Fulminant hepatic failure develops rarely, affecting less than one percent of cases overall but up to two percent of adults over 40 years. Hepatitis A infection confers lifelong immunity; chronic infection does not occur. Hepatitis A vaccination provides highly effective protection and is incorporated into childhood immunisation schedules in many European countries, though coverage varies substantially across the EU/EEA.\nHepatitis E virus, a non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Hepeviridae, exists as multiple genotypes with distinct epidemiology. Genotypes 1 and 2 primarily affect Asia and Africa, transmitting through faecally contaminated water and causing large waterborne outbreaks. Genotype 3, endemic in Europe, transmits zoonotically through consumption of undercooked meat from infected pigs, wild boar, or deer. Genotype 4 predominates in Asia. The incubation period averages 40 days with range of 15 to 60 days. Clinical presentation resembles hepatitis A with acute onset of jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and elevated aminotransferases. Most immunocompetent individuals recover fully within weeks. However, hepatitis E demonstrates substantially higher mortality in pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester, with case fatality rates reaching 20 to 25% in some settings. Chronic hepatitis E develops in immunocompromised individuals—particularly solid organ transplant recipients and patients with haematological malignancies—progressing to cirrhosis if untreated. Ribavirin demonstrates efficacy for chronic hepatitis E. No hepatitis E vaccine is licensed in Europe, though a vaccine is available in China.\nThe urgent public health priorities for Bulgaria’s acute viral hepatitis surge include: immediate virological characterisation of recent cases to determine whether hepatitis A, hepatitis E, or multiple agents are contributing; detailed epidemiological investigation including case interviews to identify common food exposures, restaurant patronage, drinking water sources, and other risk factors; food and environmental sampling if epidemiological investigation suggests foodborne or waterborne sources; review of hepatitis A vaccination coverage and consideration of emergency vaccination campaigns targeting at-risk populations if hepatitis A is confirmed as predominant agent; enhanced surveillance and provider education to ensure prompt case detection and reporting; and public health messaging regarding hepatitis A vaccination, hand hygiene, food safety practices, and proper cooking of pork and game meats. The 198% year-over-year increase cannot be explained by routine surveillance enhancement or incidental variation and demands comprehensive investigation and control measures."

Cases were reported from Lovech (one case), Montana (one case), Pleven (three cases), Ruse (one case), and Shumen (one case). Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 19 cumulative Lyme borreliosis cases compared to 13 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 46% year-over-year increase. However, interpretation of early-year Lyme borreliosis notifications requires caution because Lyme disease demonstrates strong seasonality with peak transmission during late spring through early autumn when tick activity and human outdoor recreational activity coincide. January cases likely represent either late manifestations of infections acquired during the previous tick season, diagnostic delays leading to notification lag, or potentially tick exposures during unusually warm winter weather if microclimatic conditions and vegetation permitted tick activity.\nLyme borreliosis, caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex—primarily Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii in Europe—transmits through bites of infected Ixodes ticks. Ixodes ricinus serves as the primary vector in most of Europe. The ticks acquire infection by feeding on infected reservoir hosts including small mammals, particularly rodents, and birds. Tick activity peaks during spring through autumn when temperatures and humidity support off-host survival and host-seeking behaviour. Following tick attachment and blood feeding, spirochete transmission requires approximately 24 to 48 hours, providing opportunity for infection prevention through prompt tick removal.\nLyme borreliosis manifests in stages. Early localised infection presents with erythema migrans—an expanding annular erythematous lesion with central clearing appearing days to weeks after tick bite—accompanied by fever, headache, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy in some cases. Early disseminated infection develops weeks to months after initial infection if untreated, manifesting as multiple erythema migrans lesions, neurological complications including facial nerve palsy and lymphocytic meningitis, cardiac complications including atrioventricular block, and arthralgias. Late disseminated infection develops months to years after initial infection, manifesting as intermittent or chronic arthritis affecting large joints, particularly knees, and neurological complications including encephalopathy and polyneuropathy. Borrelia afzelii particularly associates with dermatological manifestations including acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, while Borrelia garinii particularly associates with neurological manifestations. Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or ceftriaxone—depending on disease stage and manifestations—achieves cure in most cases.\nLyme borreliosis prevention focuses on avoiding tick exposure through protective clothing during outdoor activities in tick-endemic areas, using insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin on exposed skin and permethrin on clothing, performing tick checks after outdoor activities, and promptly removing attached ticks. Education of populations engaging in outdoor recreational activities in forested and grassy areas endemic for Lyme borreliosis represents an important public health intervention. The increase in early-2026 notifications may reflect improved diagnostic awareness and testing, though the 46% year-over-year increase warrants continued monitoring through the approaching tick season to assess whether this represents secular trend toward higher Lyme borreliosis incidence requiring enhanced prevention messaging and surveillance.\nSyphilis surveillance documented 11 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, representing a 450% increase from the two cases reported during Week 4 and the highest weekly count recorded in 2026. Cases were reported from Plovdiv (13 cases—likely representing multiple region numbers aggregated), Varna (one case), and Silistra (one case—though totals suggest data interpretation complexity). Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 31 cumulative syphilis cases compared to 32 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing minimal year-over-year change. The substantial week-to-week volatility—ranging from two cases in Week 4 to 11 cases in Week 5—reflects the stochastic variation typical of relatively uncommon reportable diseases and potential batch reporting of diagnosed cases from specific laboratories or clinics rather than actual weekly incidence patterns.\nSyphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, transmits through sexual contact with infectious lesions during primary or secondary syphilis, through vertical transmission from infected mother to foetus, or rarely through blood transfusion or needle sharing. The spirochete penetrates intact mucous membranes or abraded skin, disseminates through blood and lymphatics, and persists in multiple tissues if untreated. The incubation period averages 21 days with range of 10 to 90 days. Primary syphilis manifests as a painless ulcer (chancre) at the inoculation site—genitals, anus, mouth, or other sites—accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy. The chancre resolves spontaneously within three to six weeks even without treatment. Secondary syphilis develops weeks to months after primary infection in untreated individuals, manifesting as disseminated disease with non-pruritic maculopapular rash classically involving palms and soles, mucocutaneous lesions, generalised lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms. Latent syphilis follows secondary stage, divided into early latent (within one year of infection) and late latent (more than one year after infection). Tertiary syphilis develops years to decades after initial infection in approximately one-third of untreated individuals, manifesting as cardiovascular complications including aortitis and aortic aneurysms, gummatous lesions affecting skin, bones, and viscera, and neurosyphilis. Congenital syphilis results from vertical transmission, causing foetal death, premature birth, low birthweight, and multi-system manifestations in surviving infants including skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological sequelae.\nSyphilis diagnosis employs serological testing with non-treponemal tests (rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and treponemal-specific tests (enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, or Treponema pallidum particle agglutination). Direct detection via darkfield microscopy or nucleic acid amplification is possible from primary lesions but rarely performed. Penicillin remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis, with regimen and duration varying by disease stage. Doxycycline or ceftriaxone serve as alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients, though penicillin desensitisation is recommended for pregnant women requiring treatment.\nSyphilis incidence has increased in many European countries over the past two decades, particularly affecting men who have sex with men, though heterosexual transmission also contributes. Congenital syphilis has increased in several European countries, reflecting inadequate antenatal screening coverage or treatment failures. Bulgaria’s stable year-over-year syphilis notifications at approximately 30 cases per five-week period, while representing relatively low absolute burden, warrant maintenance of comprehensive sexually transmitted infection control programmes including accessible testing, partner notification and treatment, congenital syphilis prevention through universal antenatal screening, and sexual health education.\nGonorrhoea surveillance documented four laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, doubling the two cases reported during Week 4. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 16 cumulative gonorrhoea cases compared to six cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 167% year-over-year increase. While the absolute number of cases remains small, the substantial percentage increase warrants attention to assess whether this represents enhanced surveillance and testing capacity, changes in population behaviour or healthcare-seeking, or true increase in gonococcal transmission.\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, a Gram-negative diplococcus, transmits through sexual contact with infected mucous membranes. The bacterium infects columnar epithelium of the urethra, endocervix, rectum, pharynx, and conjunctiva. The incubation period ranges from one to 14 days, typically two to five days. In men, urethral infection manifests as acute urethritis with purulent discharge and dysuria; asymptomatic infection occurs in approximately ten percent. In women, endocervical infection causes mucopurulent cervicitis, though 50% or more of infections are asymptomatic; complications include ascending infection causing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Rectal and pharyngeal infections are frequently asymptomatic. Disseminated gonococcal infection develops rarely, manifesting as arthritis-dermatitis syndrome or isolated septic arthritis. Ophthalmia neonatorum results from vertical transmission during delivery, causing purulent conjunctivitis with risk of corneal perforation and blindness if untreated.\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to multiple antibiotic classes including sulphonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and most recently extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Current European treatment guidelines recommend dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin to maximise cure rates and reduce selection for resistance. However, ceftriaxone-resistant strains have been detected across Europe, raising concerns about emergence of untreatable gonorrhoea. Enhanced gonococcal surveillance including antimicrobial susceptibility testing and monitoring of treatment failures is essential for maintaining treatment effectiveness.\nUrogenital chlamydial infection surveillance documented six laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 5, a 50% increase from the four cases reported during Week 4. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 23 cumulative urogenital chlamydial infection cases compared to 11 cases during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 109% year-over-year increase. Similar to gonorrhoea, interpretation must consider whether this increase reflects enhanced testing capacity, particularly increased availability of nucleic acid amplification testing, changes in screening programmes, or true increase in transmission.\nChlamydia trachomatis serovars D through K cause urogenital chlamydial infection, the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in Europe. The obligate intracellular bacterium transmits through sexual contact, infecting columnar epithelium of the urethra, endocervix, rectum, and conjunctiva. The incubation period ranges from seven to 21 days. In men, urethral infection causes urethritis with mucoid or purulent discharge and dysuria, though approximately 50% of infections are asymptomatic. In women, endocervical infection causes mucopurulent cervicitis, though 70% or more of infections are asymptomatic; untreated infection may ascend to cause pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility. Rectal infections are frequently asymptomatic. Lymphogranuloma venereum, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, and L3, causes invasive anorectal disease and has increased among men who have sex with men in Europe.\nDiagnostic testing employs nucleic acid amplification testing on first-void urine in men or vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine in women, with substantially higher sensitivity than older culture or antigen detection methods. Treatment with azithromycin single dose or doxycycline seven-day course achieves cure in most cases. Test-of-cure is not routinely recommended unless symptoms persist, pregnancy, or concerns about adherence. Partner notification and treatment prevent reinfection and onward transmission.\nThe doubling of chlamydial infection cases year-over-year likely reflects multiple factors including increased testing through expanded screening programmes, greater availability of nucleic acid amplification testing with higher sensitivity detecting infections missed by previous diagnostic methods, increased healthcare-seeking for sexual health services, and potentially increased transmission. Distinguishing these contributions requires examination of testing volumes, positivity rates, and demographic characteristics of cases. Regardless of the primary driver, the increases in both chlamydial infection and gonorrhoea underscore the importance of comprehensive sexually transmitted infection control programmes including accessible testing and treatment services, partner notification, sexual health education, and promotion of condom use.\nHIV surveillance documented five laboratory-confirmed new diagnoses during Week 5, a 28.6% decline from the seven cases reported during Week 4. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded 19 cumulative HIV diagnoses compared to 28 diagnoses during the equivalent period in 2025, representing a 32.1% year-over-year decline. Interpretation of early-year HIV diagnosis trends requires caution given small numbers and potential seasonal variation in testing volumes and diagnosis reporting. However, if this decline represents sustained trend, it would indicate progress in HIV prevention though continued vigilance and combination prevention programming remains essential.\nHIV transmission in Bulgaria occurs primarily through sexual contact—both heterosexual and among men who have sex with men—and injection drug use, with mother-to-child transmission prevented through universal antenatal screening and antiretroviral prophylaxis. Bulgaria’s HIV epidemic remains concentrated among key populations at higher risk including men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and sex workers. Early diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy improves individual health outcomes and eliminates transmission risk through viral suppression, supporting the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets: 95% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 95% of diagnosed individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, and 95% of those on treatment achieving viral suppression.\nCongenital syphilis surveillance documented zero cases during Week 5. Since the beginning of 2026, Bulgaria recorded two cumulative congenital syphilis cases compared to three cases during the equivalent period in 2025. While the absolute numbers are small, any congenital syphilis case represents a sentinel event indicating missed opportunities for prevention through inadequate antenatal screening coverage, delayed antenatal care initiation, lack of partner treatment, or treatment failure. Universal antenatal syphilis screening in early pregnancy with prompt treatment of seropositive pregnant women prevents virtually all congenital syphilis cases. The occurrence of two congenital syphilis cases during the first five weeks of 2026 warrants review of antenatal screening protocols, coverage achieved, treatment provision for positive cases, and partner notification and treatment to identify system gaps requiring intervention."

Administrators blame “culture,” while community workers suspect “discrimination” and “structural barriers.” Late presentation leads to higher rates of preventable complications and maternal mortality.\n\n\n\nPrimary Question: What are the real barriers (economic, social, health system-related) preventing attendance, and how do they interact?\n\n\n\nMethod: Facilitated discussions with Roma women who attended few or no visits.\nHints for your design:\n\nHomogeneity: Should the group be all women? Should the moderator be from the community?\nSensitive Topics: How do you ask about discrimination without “putting words in their mouths”?\nSocial Norms: Design prompts that explore what the community thinks about clinics, not just the individual.\nLogistics: Think about childcare, transportation, and incentives to attend the session.\n\n\n\n\nMethod: Systematic audit of medical records, appointment logs, and staff communications.\nHints for your design:\n\nPatterns: What variables in a medical record show “differential treatment” (e.g., fewer labs, late initiation)?\nStructural Barriers: Can you prove wait times are longer for certain districts through the database?\nSanitization: Address the fact that doctors don’t write “I was rude” in the medical notes.\nObjectivity: Explain how an audit trail provides “hard evidence” that interviews might miss."

    "text": "28% of TB patients in Plovdiv stop their 6-month treatment early, leading to multi-drug resistant TB. Many stop around Week 11. Brief exit interviews suggest “work conflicts” or “feeling better,” but the dispensary needs a deeper understanding of why patients take the risk of stopping.\n\n\n\nPrimary Question: What are the multilayered barriers preventing completion, and why do they become critical at specific time points (like Week 11)?\n\n\n\nMethod: Narrative interviews with both “Completers” and “Discontinuers.”\nHints for your design:\n\nTemporal Sequence: Map the journey from diagnosis to the moment they decided to stop.\nStigma: How do you explore if the fear of neighbors finding out affects clinic visits?\nSide Effects: Move past “I felt sick” to how side effects interfered with their specific life (work, parenting).\nComparison: What did the “Completers” have that the others didn’t (Support? Better education?)?\n\n\n\n\nMethod: Analysis of treatment cards, side effect reports, and social work assessments.\nHints for your design:\n\nPredictors: Can you find a “red flag” in the early notes that predicts who will quit later?\nDocumentation Gaps: If a patient quit, did the staff actually record any follow-up attempts or social assessments?\nSide Effect Mapping: Track the correlation between documented nausea/hepatitis and the date of discontinuation.\nPower: Explain how analyzing the entire 2024 cohort (150 patients) is stronger than small interview samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological Precision (30%): Instrument design follows the logic of the chosen method.\nConceptual Application (30%): Arguments explicitly reference the 15-minute reading material.\nCritical Reasoning (20%): Groups identify and address valid threats (Recall Bias, Hawthorne Effect, Ecological Fallacy).\nCommunication (20%): Ability to defend and critique professionally."
