    "section": "",
    "text": "Definition: Risk factor refers to characteristics or conditions that increase the likelihood of an individual or population developing a specific disease, injury, or adverse health outcome. A risk factor is an element associated with increased risk.\nBasic definitions:\n\nRisk - The likelihood of an adverse event or disease occurrence.\nOdds - The probability of an event happening (p) divided by the probability of the event not happening (q).\n\nClassification - Risk factors can be classified in several ways:\n\nModifiable and Non-modifiable: Modifiable risk factors are those that can be changed or managed, such as smoking, diet, or physical activity. Non-modifiable risk factors are those that cannot be changed, such as genetic characteristics.\nBehavioral and Environmental Factors: Behavioral risk factors are related to individual choices and actions, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Environmental risk factors are associated with the surrounding environment of the individual, such as exposure to pollution, infectious agents, or workplace hazards.\nBiological and Social: Biological risk factors are linked to an individual’s physiology and genetics, such as hormonal imbalances or inherited traits. Social risk factors are related to the social and economic environment of the individual, such as poverty, social isolation, or lack of access to healthcare.\nProximal and Distal: Proximal risk factors are those that directly contribute to the development of a particular disease or condition, such as high blood pressure or elevated blood glucose levels. Distal risk factors are those that indirectly contribute to the development of a disease or condition, such as socio-economic status or level of education.\nPrimary and Secondary: Primary risk factors are those directly associated with the development of a specific disease or condition, such as smoking and lung cancer. Secondary risk factors are those that increase the risk of developing a disease or condition indirectly, such as obesity and its association with diabetes and heart diseases.\n\nExposure: The moment of contact between an individual and the risk factor. It includes the strength of the factor (power of exposure) and the duration of contact. Typically in epidemiology, individuals who have had contact with the risk factor are called exposed, while those without contact are termed unexposed.\nRisk Group: A group of the population with an increased risk of disease, sharing common risk factors.\n\nLow-risk groups: Not exposed to the influence of any known risk factor.\nModerate-risk groups: Exposed to moderate effects of one or several risk factors.\nHigh-risk groups: Exposed to multiple risk factors over an extended period.\nVery high-risk groups: Groups with known inherited risk factors - genetic predisposition.\n\nLeading Risk Factors\n\nBehavioral Risk Factors:\n\nSmoking\nHigh alcohol consumption\nLow physical activity\nUnhealthy diet\n\nSecondary Risk Factors:\n\nArterial hypertension\nOverweight\nHypercholesterolemia\nHyperglycemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: The concept of “causality” is fundamental to applied epidemiology. In its definition, epidemiology attempts to uncover the “causes” of diseases. In the broadest sense, a “cause” is understood as an event or phenomenon that leads to a subsequent event or phenomenon called a result. Determining the “cause” of diseases is crucial for social medicine because:\n\nIt allows for the introduction of health actions preventing contact with risk factors for disease in healthy individuals (primary prevention).\nIt clarifies the mechanism of interaction between risk factors and the body and establishes the natural course of the disease.\nIt introduces specific activities for early detection of the diseased (secondary prevention).\nIt provides opportunities for in-depth research on diseases, discovery, and implementation of specific therapy and rehabilitation (tertiary prevention).\n\nTypes of Epidemiological Relationships: The concept of causality in epidemiology is quite complex. Two types of relationships are possible:\n\nDirect - an association (correlation) between the factor and the result, with or without a true cause-effect relationship between them. When two phenomena are related but there is no cause-effect relationship, we refer to it as “parallelism.”\nIndirect - it is also possible for “third” or more factors to “blur” the true cause-effect relationship between phenomena or to modify (increase or decrease) the manifestation thereof.\n\nMechanisms: From the perspective of causality theory, a factor can cause a disease through the following mechanisms:\n\nThe factor is necessary and sufficient. An example of such interaction is monogenic diseases. In this group of diseases, the factor represents a genetic structural anomaly that leads to a phenotypic change.\nThe factor is necessary but not sufficient. Many infectious diseases, for example, require additional factors besides the infectious agent. Tuberculosis bacteria are necessary for the manifestation of acute miliary tuberculosis, but they are not sufficient to cause it alone. Here, the interaction of the infectious agent with other factors in the body and the environment, which modify its effect (modifiers), is primarily important.\nThe factor is not necessary but sufficient. An example of such interaction is some oncological diseases. Smoking is a proven risk factor of lung cancer. Independently, it is sufficient for this disease. However, smoking is not “necessary” as an obligatory element for the onset of the disease. Other factors alone or in interaction with each other can cause the same disease in non-smokers.\nThe factor is neither necessary nor sufficient. These are factors that have been mistakenly considered “etiological” or “risk” factors for the onset of the disease. However, it is established that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause it.\n\nTypes of Interactions between Factor (Cause) and Result: Despite the various types of interactions between different factors in the genesis of the disease, from an epidemiological point of view, three types of interfactor interactions can be presented schematically and simplified.\n\nChain Interaction: Mediator/Modifier Type: In this form of interaction, a single risk factor alone is potent enough to incite a particular ailment. However, the involvement of a third factor, often termed a “mediator,” intercedes in the connection between the risk factor and the disease manifestation. For instance, the relationship between smoking and cerebrovascular disease - while smoking can directly lead to cerebrovascular issues, it can also induce arterial hypertension, which subsequently increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, within this model, there’s discussion about modifying interactions, where an additional factor alters the impact of the risk factor, either attenuating or amplifying it. Such alterations may exhibit:\nMultiplicative effects (significantly stronger when combined).\nAdditive effects (the combined influence of the modifier and the risk factor).\n\nDivergent Interaction: Confounding Factor Type: This scenario involves a factor that acts as a common underlying cause for both the risk factor and the disease outcome. In clinical epidemiology, common confounding factors include gender and age. Despite being often categorized as “risk” factors, gender and age should more accurately be labeled as “prognostic”, rather than direct causes of diseases. For example, when exploring the link between coffee consumption and myocardial infarction, while coffee intake might be perceived as a direct risk factor, upon separate examination within smoker and non-smoker groups, the link disappear. Here, coffee consumption acts as a confounding factor, while the actual cause-effect relationship lies between smoking and heart attacks. The process of segregating individuals based on such factors is known as “stratification.”\nCumulative Interaction (Collier): This type involves a factor that emerges as a shared outcome of both the risk factor and the disease itself. For instance, a study conducted by Sackett in 1979, where an analysis of hospitalized patients found a correlation between locomotor deficits and infectious lung diseases. Initially appearing as a plausible association, later scrutiny in a sample of non-hospitalized individuals failed to establish such a relationship. This discrepancy underscores the nuanced nature of disease interactions, wherein seemingly related conditions might, upon closer examination, reveal independent pathways to the same outcome, such as hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Bradford-Hill endeavors to introduce criteria that should be met to determine a causal relationship between two factors. His work remains foundational in epidemiology and causality theory.\nCriteria:\n\nStrength of Association: The stronger the statistical association between phenomena, the more likely the relationship between them is causal.\nConsistency (Reproducibility): The findings should be reproducible by other researchers, at different times, in different places, and using different methods, with explanations for any discrepancies.\nSpecificity of Association: The more precisely the disease and exposure to the presumed risk factor can be defined, the stronger the observed association.\nTemporal Relationship: The presumed cause must always precede the effect in time. This is the only obligatory criterion.\nBiological Gradient: Changes in the intensity of exposure to the presumed risk factor lead to corresponding changes in the level of disease occurrence.\nPlausibility: The association must have a logical explanation in line with general medical knowledge and science.\nCoherence: All observations and results should be consistent with the hypothetical model.\nExperimental Evidence: In experimental conditions, changes in the cause should lead to changes in the outcome.\nAnalogy: The association should resemble similar described phenomena and events.\n\nMandatory Criterion: Temporal relationship"

За една група студенти от втори курс например, може да се установи, че се различават по пол, възраст, успех, отношение към определен проблем и редица други характеристики.

Основното им разделяне е на вариационни и категорийни. Вариационните, наричани още количествени, са тези, които се изразяват с числа. Те могат да бъдат прекъснати (дискретни) и непрекъснати (континюитетни). Прекъснатите могат да приемат отделни, изолирани една от друга числови стойности. Такива са броят на членовете на отделно домакинство, броят боледувания за една година, брой живородени деца и др. 2. Непрекъснати са признаците, които могат да получават всякакви характеристики в даден числов интервал. Такива са: теглото, температурата, кръвното налягане. Посочените характеристики могат да бъдат измервани с изключителна точност след десетичната запетая. Категорийните признаци, наричани още атрибутивни или качествени са тези, чиито характеристики нямат числов израз. За тях се използват “етикети” или описателно наименование. Такива са например пол, семейно положение, кръвна група, вид заболяване и др.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nПризнаците биват два основни типа: количествени и качествени.\n\n\n\n\n\nКоличествени са тези променливи, които могат да бъдат изразени числено, а качествени са тези, които нямат числено значение."

    "text": "Показатели за централна тенденция\n\nСредна аритметична\nСредната аритметична се изчислява в зависимост от вида на представяне на количествените данни. Те могат да бъдат изброени негрупирани числа или таблично подредени агрегирани и групирани стойности. От своя страна групировката може да бъде извършена във вариационен или интервален ред.\n\nНегрупирани данни\nПри изчисление на средната аритметична за негрупирани данни се използва формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{}}{n}\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(\\sum x_{}\\) е сборът на числовите стойности на наблюдаваната променлива;\n\\({n}\\) е броят на наблюденията.\n\nНека онагледим това с пример. По-долу са представени стойностите на променливата “сърдечен пулс” за 10 студента от втори курс.\n\n\n [1] 90 80 89 72 73 74 78 86 84 82\n\n\nГрафично е представено тяхното разпределение на фигура Фигура 2. В случая, средната аритметична представлява “средата” на това разпределение (най-издадената му част). За да я изчислим разделяме сбора от стойностите на пулса за всеки един от студентите върху техния брой. Така получаваме:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{90+80+89+72+73+74+78+86+84+82}{10}\\] \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{808}{10} = 80.8\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 2: Разпределение на пулса - по хоризонтала са представени наблюдавани стойности, а по вертикала колко често са наблюдавани те в извадката. С черна пунктирана линия е представена средната аритметична. Представеното разпределение се нарича нормално - има камбановидна, симетрична форма\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nГрупирани данни\n\nИнтервален ред\nКогато разполагаме с по-голям обем данни, удобно е тяхното представяне в групирана форма. При интервалния ред тази групировка се извършва чрез “разкъсване” на стойностите на изследваната променлива в равномерни и неприпокриващи се стъпки - интервали. Всеки от тях се определя от долна и горна лимитираща стойност (граница). При формирането на интервалните групи се преброяват само участниците, чиято наблюдавана стойност е в границите на интервала. С други думи, при тази групировка “губим” статистическа точност, защото не знаем индивидуалните стойностите на участниците, а само към коя група принадлежат. Пример за интервална групировка е представен в Таблица 2 .\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 2: Пример за интервален ред при измерването на пулс сред 45 студенти\n\n\n\n\n\nпулс\nброй студенти\n\n\n\n\n48 - 52\n4\n\n\n53 - 57\n5\n\n\n58 - 62\n8\n\n\n63 - 67\n11\n\n\n68 - 72\n6\n\n\n73 - 77\n6\n\n\n78 - 82\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЗа да изчислим средната стойност за променливата пулс в посочения пример, използваме формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{u}\\cdot{f}}{\\sum_f }\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(x_{u}\\) e средата на всеки от интервалите. Тя се изчислява като половината на сумата между горната и долната лимитираща стойност. Например, за интервала 48 - 52, средата е 50;\n\\(f\\) е броят на наблюденията за всеки един интервал;\n\\(x_{u}\\cdot{f}\\) е произведението между средата на интервала и броя на наблюденията в него;\n\\(\\sum{x_{u}\\cdot{f}}\\) е сумата от всички произведения;\n\\(\\sum_f\\) е сумата от всички наблюдавани участници.\n\nНека представим нагледно примера в Таблица 2 . Първата стъпка е определянето на средата на интервалите. Това е извършено в Таблица 3 .\n\n\n\nТаблица 3: Стъпка 1 - Определяне на средата на всеки интервал\n\n\n\n\n\nпулс\nсреда на интервала\nброй студенти\n\n\n\n\n48 - 52\n50\n4\n\n\n53 - 57\n55\n5\n\n\n58 - 62\n60\n8\n\n\n63 - 67\n65\n11\n\n\n68 - 72\n70\n6\n\n\n73 - 77\n75\n6\n\n\n78 - 82\n80\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСлед това изчисляваме произведенията между броя наблюдавани студенти и средата на интервала.

При него записваме всяка стойност на интересуващата ни променлива, а срещу нея нанасяме броя на наблюдаваните лица, при които сме я наблюдавали. Пример за степенен ред е представен в Таблица 5 .\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 5: Пример за степенен ред при измерването на пулс сред 17 студенти\n\n\n\n\n\nСтойност на пулса\nБрой студенти\n\n\n\n\n59\n1\n\n\n60\n0\n\n\n61\n2\n\n\n62\n4\n\n\n63\n0\n\n\n64\n3\n\n\n65\n2\n\n\n66\n1\n\n\n67\n1\n\n\n68\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЗа изчисляването на средната аритметична, при данни в степенен ред, използваме формулата:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{}\\cdot{f}}{\\sum_f }\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) е символът за средна аритметична;\n\\(x_{}\\) e стойността на наблюдаваната променлива;\n\\(f\\) е броят на наблюденията за всяка една стойност;\n\\(x_{}\\cdot{f}\\) е произведението между всяка от стойностите на променливата и броя на наблюденията за нея;\n\\(\\sum{x_{}\\cdot{f}}\\) е сумата от всички произведения;\n\\(\\sum{f}\\) е сумата от всички наблюдавани участници.\n\nНека представим нагледно примера в Таблица 5 . Първата стъпка, за изчисление на средната аритметична, е определянето на произведенията между всяка една стойност на променливата и съответния брой на наблюденията.

При построяването на графика - разпределението е камбановидно и симетрично.*\nАко сме изчислили теглото на извадка от 1000 души и сме установили че \\({\\bar{x}} = {80\\pm 10}\\) и приемем променливата за нормално разпределена можем да твърдим, че 95 % от участниците (950 изследвани) имат тегло в диапазона \\(80\\pm 2\\cdot{SD}= 80\\pm 20\\) или от 60 до 120 кг. Останалите 2,5 % от останалите 50 участници (25) ще имат тегло над 110 кг, а 25 души (2,5 %) ще имат тегло под 60 кг.*\n\n\n\n\nИлюстративно нормалното разпределение е представено на фигура Фигура 3 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 3: Нормално разпределение"

Показателят се изчислява по формула:\n\\[{IQR} = {Q3} - {Q1}\\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\({IQR}\\) е символът за интерквартилен размах;\n\\({Q3}\\) е стойността на 3-тия квартил 10;\n\\({Q1}\\) е стойността на 1-вия квартил.\n\nЗа да разберем какво представлява интерквартилния размах, нека първо представим данните за болничния престой във възходящ ред:\n\n\n [1]  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  3  3  3  4  4  4  4  4  6  6  6  6 17 24 25\n\n\nАко разделим тези 24 пациенти в 4 групи (по 6-ма) ще установим стойностите на 4-те квартила. В случая 6-тият пациент, пролежал 2 дни, е на границата между първата и останалите три четвъртини на статистическия ред. Стойността, на неговото пролежаване представлява 1-вия квартил \\({Q1}\\). Стойността на пролежаването на 12-тия пациент (4 дни) ограничава разделя статистически ред на две равни части, това е и медианата или втория квартил \\({Q2}\\) - половината пациенти са пролежали повече дни от него. Стойността на пролежаването на 18-тия пациент (6 дни) е 4-тия квартил \\({Q3}\\).\nСлед като сме определили квартилите прилагаме формулата. Интерквартилният размах е\n\\[{IQR} = {Q3} - {Q1} = 6 - 2 = 4\\]\nЗа графично представяне на интерквартилния размах използваме боксплот диаграмата представена на Фигура 5 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 5: Боксплотът се описва като кутия с мустаци. Лявата страна на кутията представя първия, а дясната страна третия квартил. В средата на кутията с черна линия хоризонтална линия е представена медианата.\n\n\n\n\n\nС помощта на интерквартилния размах можем да определим кои стойности са “екстремални” 11"

При 19 от тях това интервалът обхваща стойността на истината средна за генералната съвкупност (сини линии).

    "title": "Medical ethics - Introduction and principles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Doctors have been concerted with ethics since the earliest days of medical practice. Traditionally, medical practitioners have been expected to be motivated by a desire to help their patients. Ethical codes and systems, such as the Hippocratic oath, have emphasized this.\nDuring the latter half of the twentieth century, advances in medical science, in conjunction with social and political changes, meant that the accepted conventions of the doctor-patient relationship were increasingly being questioned. After the Nuremberg trials, in which the crimes of Nazi doctors, among others, were exposed, it became clear that doctors cannot be assumed to be good simply by virtue of their profession.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthics is a study of morality and defining what is right or wrong. One’s first experience with ethics comes from family, religion, background, historical perspective, personal training, and education.\n\n\n‘Medical ethics’ is one subset of the broader disciplines of ‘healthcare ethics’ and ‘bioethics’. It overlaps with both but focuses on the duties of doctors. The original Greek and Latin expressions for ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ conveyed the same idea of a code of conduct acceptable to a particular group.\nNowadays,‘ethics’ can either mean conforming to recognized standards of practice or describe the general study of morality. Traditionally, professional ethics was what doctors defined for themselves, from their own perspective. Their duty was to work to the standards established by their peers and avoid any action that would bring the profession into disrepute. Ethics, in this sense, has always been a central concern of medicine.\nThe key difference between bioethics and medical ethics is that bioethics generally is concerned the moral principles of all biomedical technologies, such as cloning, stem cell therapy, xenotransplantation and the use of animal models in research while medical ethics is more specific and focused on everyday clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequentialism, as its name suggests, is a theory whose focus is purely on the outcome of an action. For a consequentialist, the only question to be asked when seeking a moral reason for doing something is ‘What is the result?’ The most famous form of consequentialism is utilitarianism: ‘an act is morally right if it maximizes the good’ (the terms consequentialism and utilitarianism are commonly used interchangeably).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilitarian Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the available means, act in such a way as to do as much good as possible\n\n\n\nThe basic principle of utilitarian ethics is do good, which is the oldest and most straightforward ethical principle. Utilitarian ethic is useful primarily in catastrophic situations. In times of war, earthquakes, or other major accidents, we have to save as many lives as possible in the shortest amount of time with very limited means. In a rational triage, one would group the wounded into those with minor wounds and injuries who can wait and those who require that we urgently stop their bleeding, clear their airways or prevent further aggravation of their health condition. Utilitarian ethics also offers appropriate advice to activities in the field of public health and preventive medicine.\nConsequentialism makes no distinction between acts and omissions. The outcome of choosing not to do something is just as significant for a consequentialist as the outcome of an act that one has chosen to perform. This means that the scope of our moral obligations may seem unfeasibly large1\nAnother counterintuitive aspect of consequentialism is its apparent imperviousness to considerations of justice. Suppose that we knew for a fact that capital punishment functions effectively as a deterrent: for each person executed, five murderers are deterred. To save resources, we might seize upon any random person, decree that they are the murderer, and execute them. Not only would this have the same deterrent effect, but it would also save police time and money since they would not need to track down the real culprit. A consequentialist would not worry about this, since the overall outcome may be deemed to outweigh the fact that one innocent person has been killed. But for many people, the injustice committed on the innocent man outweighs the beneficial consequences.\n\n\n\nCommunitarianism focuses on the fact that people have responsibilities as well as rights. It advocates policies based on consensus rather than compromise. It asserts that individuals need to concentrate not only on their own rights, but also their responsibilities to people close to them and to community. Communitarian arguments expect a concern for others to be taken into account when decisions are made. This approach comes to the fore when considering the health of communities rather than individuals. It is particularly relevant to public health ethics, genetics and any situation in which an important factor is the interrelatedness of individuals and of their interests.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘deontology’ stems from the Greek for ‘duty’. In contrast to consequentialism, a deontologist approaches ethical questions by identifying and adhering to predefined moral rules, or duties. Once we have established what our duty is, we must perform it, regardless of what the outcome may be. However, this raises the question of how we establish what our duties are.\nThe German philosopher Immanuel Kant argues that we can establish our moral duty purely through the exercise of reason without having to derive them from any theological source. This is known as ‘the categorical imperative’. To achieve this, Kant urges that in all of our decisions we should always behave in such a way that we could will for what we do to become a universal law. This means that we cannot treat our own interests as being superior to those of others. It also means that moral duties are consistent and non-arbitrary - they apply to everyone equally.\nIn utilitarian ethics, the most prominent status is given to the principle of beneficence. Kantian ethics, however, leads us to appreciate the individual, one’s free will, and rational responsibility for one’s decisions - the most important is, therefore, the ethical principle of the respect for autonomy. By requiring one to follow, without exception, universal rules, Kant excluded emotions and interpersonal relations from entering ethical reflections. Even more: an act is ethical only if the motivation comes from the general rule. If done from fear or love, the ethical value of the same act is neutral. In Kantian ethics, there is no place for compromise and no weighing of motivations for acting against the consequences, regardless of how predictable, and thus avoidable, the latter could be.\n\n\n\nIn ethical assessment, utilitarians look at the consequences of a particular act, and deontological ethicists at the conformity of the act with pre-defined rules. Virtue ethics stands in a different position: it’s foundation is the ethical characteristics of a person. Certain personal characteristics are recognized as virtues2 and others as vices. Honesty, generosity, compassion, courage, justice, fidelity, and veracity are virtues that characterize an ethical person, while deception, selfishness, cruelty, infidelity, and disingenuousness are some of the many characteristics that denote a vicious person.Virtue ethics is now regarded as being one of the three key moral theories, along with consequentialism and deontology.\nHowever, virtue ethics requires fundamentally that we have an idea of what the virtues are, and this can be difficult to establish. Certainly, Aristotle’s idea of the virtues does not necessarily harmonize with twenty-first century values. (Along with many other Greeks of his time, Aristotle thought that keeping slaves was perfectly compatible with being virtuous, and believed that women were intrinsically inferior to men.)\nVirtue ethics may be seen as an upgrading of utilitarian and deontological ethics. While virtues are in a central position, the incorporation of practical wisdom also rings consequences into virtue ethics. The rules of deontological ethics are important, yet not unbreakable. Finally, the main advantage of virtue ethics over the other two theories is that it includes human relations, and indeed gives a central position to them, a factor that has a decisive role in the practical reasoning of all of us.\n\n\n\nAnother practical approach is to use narrative or storytelling in order to give the problem context and clarify the ethical crux of it. This has been described as ‘the oldest way of exploring and expounding ethical issues’ through myth, parable or biography. It approaches problems by looking at the patient’s situation as a whole rather than considering a particular facet in isolation. It can involve an overview of the patient’s life, values and experiences of illness. Different health professionals and family members may present the picture from different angles and considering the same dilemma from such various viewpoints provides a way of ensuring that all relevant perspectives and perceptions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are influenced by ethics, the two can contradict one another in a healthcare setting. Law is based on explicit, written norms with a clear system for enacting such norms. Legal norms (approved international agreements, national constitutions, laws, and regulations) are organized hierarchically, should be mutually consistent, have a clearly defined spatial scope of their enactment, and can only apply to actions committed after the legal norm has been enacted. When an individual violates a specific legal norm, clearly defined procedures for establishing guilt and prescribed sanctions are in place.\nSometimes,legal duties as a healthcare professional can conflict with ethical responsibilities. The law may force ones do things their ethics just don’t condone. Or ones may want to do something because it’s ethical, but the law isn’t on their side.\n\n\n\n\nExisting ethical theories do not necessarily give easy answers to moral problems and, indeed, can yield counterintuitive results if pushed to their logical extremes. There is also the problem that moral values differ according to culture and context. What if the doctor is a deontologist, and the patient a consequentialist? Increasingly, in modern medicine, doctors may be treating patients who speak a different language, come from a different country, or practise a different religion. In short, patients’ values may be radically different from those of the doctor, and those of one doctor may differ from those of their colleagues.\nThe ‘four principles’ approach was developed partly in response to this problems, however the approach is not an ethical theory per se. Rather, it attempts to set out certain key considerations which are independent of social, cultural, or religious contexts. Since its inception in the twentieth century, the four principles approach has become extremely influential and is now the dominant framework for medical ethics teaching.\nThe principles in question are:\n\nAutonomy of the individual\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\nAs suggested, these principles are more properly understood as a distillation of other ethical theories, synthesized and reformatted for use in the medical setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding information to patients and allowing them to make their own decisions\n\n\n\nAutonomy means self-governance: making and carrying out one’s own decisions. The importance of respect for autonomy is implicit or explicit in nearly all moral theories. With changing social expectations and, arguably, less hierarchical social and political structures, respect for autonomy has grown in importance, and is regarded by some as the cornerstone of the four principles. Autonomy is at the root of many of the fundamental requirements of good medical practice.\nThe autonomy of the individual includes the right to being informed (for there is no autonomy without information) and the right to confidentiality and privacy (otherwise other parties might influence an individual’s decisions without considering his or her will).\nThe principle of respect for autonomy is not absolute, but there is heated debate about how and when it should be overridden by other principles. What does seem clear is that it will inevitably clash with one or more of the other three principles at times. Resolving these clashes is one of the major preoccupations of medical ethicists and medical practitioners.\n\n\n\nBeneficence is the act of helping people, or benefiting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeneficence\n\n\n\n\n\nUndertaking actions intended to benefit the patient\n\n\n\nBeneficence encapsulates what many people regard as the essence of medicine. Doctors are not here to function as servants, mechanics, shopkeepers, or teachers for their patients. Rather, their unique and special role is to help people, cure disease, relieve distress and suffering, prolong lives, and improve health. It has been argued that in this respect, doctors are radically different from other professionals.3\nAs medical technology and life-preserving interventions have proliferated, it has become evident that patients and doctors have extremely divergent views on the beneficence of life-prolonging measures. Some argue passionately for the continuance of treatment, while others argue that there are situations in which the patient cannot be benefited by being kept alive. Problems arise when a patient’s view of what is ‘beneficent’ differs from that of the doctor. We have seen that respect for autonomy is an essential component of the four principles. But a doctor may find it difficult, if not impossible, to respect the autonomy of a patient whose concept of beneficence is radically different\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is the principle of preventing or avoiding harm to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nActing so as to avoid harming the patient\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence is sometimes regarded as the primary ethical principle to which doctors should adhere. It features in the Hippocratic oath, and it reappears in the common phrase ‘primum non nocere’ (from Latin: first, do no harm). The importance of this principle stems largely from the recognition that those same skills which allow a doctor to improve a patient’s health or well-being, can in themselves cause damage, pain, or sickness. Yet the injunction ‘first do no harm’ is perhaps too extreme. After all, if this really were a doctor’s first and primary obligation, they would not be able to do anything at all. It is impossible to think of any medical procedure or intervention that is entirely without risk. A simple vaccination causes harm by puncturing the skin; even screening may cause harm in the form of anxiety or a false-positive result. For this reason, it is clear that non-maleficence cannot function as medicine’s primary principle; rather, it serves as a balance against beneficence. Beneficence is an active principle - it calls for doctors to intervene to benefit their patients. Non-maleficence is a passive and cautionary principle that reminds doctors to think about the harm they may cause by intervening.\nQuestions of how to interpret “harm” also arise in the public health context. In recent years, some criticisms have been raised regarding breast screening. Frequently, screening programmes are justified on the ground that they save lives by detecting diseases which might otherwise have gone unnoticed until too late. However, in the breast screening context, it has been suggested that the screening programme causes excessive and unjustified interventions. In short, it causes harm. Some patients have biopsies only to discover there was nothing wrong. Others may have cancer detected, but in circumstances where the disease would never have become symptomatic. For example, if a very elderly patient has a very slow-growing cancer, it is highly unlikely that it will kill her. The question of whether such inadvertent harms outweigh the benefits of screening programmes is fraught. These problems, of course, also affect other moral theories that rely on concepts of harm, in particular consequentialism\n\n\n\nJustice is the principle of treating others fairly, avoiding discrimination and distributing resources equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding discrimination, distributing re- sources fairly\n\n\n\nJustice differs from the three principles already discussed. Autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence are highly patient centred. However, most moral theories recognize that the individual is not the sole ethical concern. By its very nature, ethics is a social phenomenon, meaning that questions of fairness come into play. There are two primary ways in which the principle of justice affects ethical decision-making in medicine. Firstly, there is the issue of how other people may be affected by a particular decision. Secondly, there is the question of discrimination: do some patients receive better or worse treatment than others?\nTo comply with the requirements of justice, it is important that decision - making is transparent and consistent. This can be difficult in complex healthcare systems, serving patients whose needs and values vary widely.\nThe other facet of justice is discrimination. It is often assumed that discrimination is intrinsically wrong. Yet, if we never discriminated, we would be unable to function at all. Remembering Aristotle’s injunction, ’treat equals equally and unequals unequally’, it is clear that discrimination in itself is not a problem. It would be unjust to treat a patient with a broken neck exactly the same as one with a broken finger. Where needs are different, we should treat people differently. This involves discriminating: noticing those differences and making decisions accordingly.\nDiscrimination is only a problem when it is unjust. We have suggested it is appropriate to discriminate between patients with different needs; however, if it were decided that only dark-haired patients would be treated, this would clearly be unjust, since there is no connection between hair colour and need for treatment. The challenge, therefore, is to be able to recognize what are, and what are not, the sorts of inequalities that justify treating people differently\n\n\n\n\nReal ethical dilemmas are those for which every possible action (including the omission of action) brings some ethical costs to a person, or to a group of people involved. Ethical analysis begins with a list of persons involved and then explores, for each of them, the ethical benefits and costs of a certain action according to the four ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. In this way, two or more possible actions with their ethical benefits and costs are compared. Ethical analysis does not automatically lead to the recommended action; rather, it is a practical approach to analyse a dilemma, identify the problematic aspects of each of the possible actions, and alleviate the related ethical costs.\nIf an act exists that will benefit all concerned and will not offend anybody, including oneself, then ethics or ethical analysis is not needed. Ethical consideration is also not applicable to situations in which the actor has no choice. Very often, however, we do have a choice; nevertheless, each act brings some benefits and some burdens to the persons whom the act involves.\nEthical analysis is helpful in such situations. The three steps of ethical analysis are:\n\nA list of possible actions\nList of persons or groups of persons whom the actions concern\nPreparing a table with rows for each person or group of persons concerned and columns for the four ethical principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco, aged 3, was seriously hurt in a traffic accident. Upon arrival to the intensive-care unit, he is in severe hemorrhagic shock. His father, a Jehovah’s Witness, prohibits blood transfusion, even after being told that immediate blood transfusion, followed by an operation is the only possibility for survival. The physician has to decide whether he will order blood transfusion or follow the father’s demand.\n\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are blood transfusion against the father’s will or no transfusion.\nThe persons involved are Marco, his family, and the physician. In addition, we will also add to the list the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses since they might be hurt if they learn that their religious belief was ignored. This brings us to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco’s family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysician\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s\nWitnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician’s decision to apply blood transfusion against the father’s will is to be compared to the alternative option - no transfusion, which would almost certainly lead to Marco’s death. We will now insert ethical benefits, marked with a “+”, and ethical costs, marked with a “−”. Assessment of ethical benefits and costs is clearly subjective; however, subjectivity is an unavoidable characteristic of every ethical deliberation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n?\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nMarco’s family\n---\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nPhysician\n+++\n++\n++\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n–\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the ethical benefits of a transfusion against the father’s demand greatly outweigh the ethical costs. The physician in the intensive-care unit has to make decisions without delay which gives Marco a chance for survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian, aged 12, has been treated for neuroblastoma for two years. Despite intensive treatment with three lines of cytotoxic drugs, he is now in relapse. Physicians agree that there is no indication for further active treatment and recommend only supportive and palliative treatment. Due to anaemia, Damian is weak and dizzy. A blood transfusion might lead to short-term improvement of his symptoms but clearly cannot reverse the course of the disease. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, his parents refuse blood transfusion.\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are a transfusion against the parents’ will or no transfusion. The persons involved are Damian, his family, the physician, and the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Here is the table, as prepared for the decision to order blood transfusion against the will of the parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nDamian\n--\n?\n+\n?\n\n\nDamian’s family\n---\n--\n--\n---\n\n\nPhysician\n+\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n---\n---\n--\n---\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the transfusion brings very few benefits and severe ethical costs, which no lengthy explanation can reduce. As a teenager, Damian understands the religion in which he was raised. For the parents, the extremely painful experience of the imminent death of their child would be even worse due to a lack of respect from physician’s side. Their sorrow and anger might spread to the whole community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.\nIt is clear that ethical analysis involves both ethical and professional arguments and it is a strong tool against one-sided presentation of ethical dilemmas. Attention to a single dimension, most often to respect for individual autonomy, should not obscure the ethical benefits and costs for other persons whose interests are also at stake. It is clear that ethical benefits and costs are subject to individual interpretation. Ethics is not mathematics, and conclusions from an ethical analysis may be debatable, based on different professional arguments. Thus, ethical analysis does not provide a single answer, but rather a framework for balancing and reaching a rational conclusion.\n\n\n\nTen medical students are learning how to perform rectal examinations. This is important for their education. However, no one likes undergoing a rectal examination unnecessarily. To ensure that students get the necessary practice, the consultant who is teaching them is trying to decide whether to allow these ten students to practise a rectal examination on 96-year-old anaesthetized woman who is undergoing surgery for an unrelated issue. The woman, who has mental capacity, has not been informed nor has she given consent. Is this ethically acceptable?\n\n\nPerforming a medical procedure on a patient who has not agreed to this may seem deceptive. Doctors are usually expected to be honest and trust-worthy and act with integrity. These are virtues that are explicitly required by the General Medical Council (GMC). Nevertheless, students may be well motivated in wanting to carry out the procedure: doing so should enable them to be better doctors in future. It seems reasonable to suppose that no one has ill intentions towards the patient in question; the procedure is not intended to harm her, and she need never know what has been done to her. However, a wise consultant may be able to exercise a more discerning judgement. Although no ill intention is involved, harm may come to the patient. Such harm, if she was not asked for her consent, will come as a shock. Though a very low-risk procedure, a rectal examination is something that carries a strong taboo in our society. The patient if she discovers she has undergone this may feel outraged or violated. We can never be entirely sure that a patient will not discover something we would prefer was kept secret. The patient’s virtues should also be considered here. If she had been asked, and had agreed to let the students examine her, this would have been a virtuous decision on her part. However, if the students examine her without her knowledge or consent, she has no opportunity to exercise virtue.\n\n\n\nFor a consequentialist, the question of whether the patient agrees to undergo the procedure is irrelevant. As long as she never finds out, no harm is done. If the action benefits ten medical students, this may be enough. Although, of course, it would be different if the procedure causes the patient harm (as it might on a 96-year-old patient), then the procedure could not be justified. However, a utilitarian must also consider the harm that might arise if the patient does find out - the patient may be distressed and angry. Patient negative experience could outweigh the benefit to the medical students. There are also broader harms and benefits to consider. If patients learn that they may be ‘practised on’ while under anaesthetic, they may lose trust in hospitals. But if no one ever finds out, perhaps overall large numbers of patients could benefit, since students will have the chance to improve their skills. If we could be 100% certain that the patient would never find out, the consequentialist would be completely happy to advise the ten students to proceed with their examination\n\n\n\nIt should immediately be apparent that a deontologist would not allow medical students to practise on an unconscious patient without her consent. This would be disregarding her autonomy, as well as being deceptive. However, would obtaining consent in advance make a difference, given that students would still be ‘using’ the patient for their own practice? Given the previous points about autonomy and consent, it seems plausible that a deontologist would be happy for the students to practise on the patient if she had consented in advance. If the patient consents, she shares in the ends of the students, that is, their desire to become better doctors, and this becomes one of her own ends.\n\n\n\nClearly, performing examinations on a patient without her consent is not in keeping with respect for autonomy. However, if this is known to be a teaching hospital, perhaps we could assume that consent to training is implied by this patient’s presence in the hospital. If so, then the procedure may not be deemed to breach the patient’s autonomy at all.\nOne might argue that the procedure is non-maleficent, and could even be beneficent if by chance it picks up something that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. It could also be argued that the broader benefits of carrying out such training in terms of improving population health could be taken to outweigh the other principles, that is, justice might decree that all patients should be willing to undergo this kind of thing for the sake of a wider population benefit.\nHowever, there are a number of issues to consider here. The first issue is whether it is reasonable to infer consent from a patient’s presence in a teaching hospital. Doctors often make this argument, but it is highly questionable. Many members of the public may not be aware of whether their nearest hospital is a teaching hospital or not. Even if they are, there is no reason to assume that they will know that this means they will be exposed to students’ examinations. Therefore, unless the patient has been explicitly consulted, it is not reasonable to suppose that she has somehow consented to being examined while under anaesthetic.\nThe arguments related to beneficence and non-maleficence likewise seem weak when probed further. It is unlikely that the examinations will cause harm; yet there is always some degree of risk and this may be exacerbated by the patient’s anger and distress if she feels she’s been abused or deceived.\nThe question about beneficence is very significant here. Some patients do not wish to know if they have a particular condition, and would choose not to attend screening programmes for this reason. The know-ledge of having a serious medical condition, though regarded as beneficial by many people, can be regarded as harmful by others. This is why people are offered screening, rather than being compelled to participate. If something sinister were identified in this woman, we do not know if she would be grateful or angry and upset about having been denied a choice.\nFinally, it is undoubtedly an admirable thing to participate in research or training. Surprisingly many patients are willing to do this when asked directly. Their choice to be involved may be described as truly altruistic. But when no choice is given, the act is not altruistic. There may also be questions to ask about why this patient in particular is being selected for this training. This is where considerations of justice can be extremely useful in identifying hidden ethical problems. What role is this patient’s age playing here? Has she been chosen as an ‘easy’ option?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n-/?\n-\n+\n---\n\n\nStudents\n+\n---\n+++\n+"

Traditionally, medical practitioners have been expected to be motivated by a desire to help their patients. Ethical codes and systems, such as the Hippocratic oath, have emphasized this.\nDuring the latter half of the twentieth century, advances in medical science, in conjunction with social and political changes, meant that the accepted conventions of the doctor-patient relationship were increasingly being questioned.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ethics is a study of morality and defining what is right or wrong. One’s first experience with ethics comes from family, religion, background, historical perspective, personal training, and education.\n\n\n‘Medical ethics’ is one subset of the broader disciplines of ‘healthcare ethics’ and ‘bioethics’. It overlaps with both but focuses on the duties of doctors. The original Greek and Latin expressions for ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ conveyed the same idea of a code of conduct acceptable to a particular group.\nNowadays,‘ethics’ can either mean conforming to recognized standards of practice or describe the general study of morality. Traditionally, professional ethics was what doctors defined for themselves, from their own perspective. Their duty was to work to the standards established by their peers and avoid any action that would bring the profession into disrepute. Ethics, in this sense, has always been a central concern of medicine.\nThe key difference between bioethics and medical ethics is that bioethics generally is concerned the moral principles of all biomedical technologies, such as cloning, stem cell therapy, xenotransplantation and the use of animal models in research while medical ethics is more specific and focused on everyday clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequentialism, as its name suggests, is a theory whose focus is purely on the outcome of an action. For a consequentialist, the only question to be asked when seeking a moral reason for doing something is ‘What is the result?’ The most famous form of consequentialism is utilitarianism: ‘an act is morally right if it maximizes the good’ (the terms consequentialism and utilitarianism are commonly used interchangeably).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilitarian Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the available means, act in such a way as to do as much good as possible\n\n\n\nThe basic principle of utilitarian ethics is do good, which is the oldest and most straightforward ethical principle. Utilitarian ethic is useful primarily in catastrophic situations. In times of war, earthquakes, or other major accidents, we have to save as many lives as possible in the shortest amount of time with very limited means. In a rational triage, one would group the wounded into those with minor wounds and injuries who can wait and those who require that we urgently stop their bleeding, clear their airways or prevent further aggravation of their health condition. Utilitarian ethics also offers appropriate advice to activities in the field of public health and preventive medicine.\nConsequentialism makes no distinction between acts and omissions. The outcome of choosing not to do something is just as significant for a consequentialist as the outcome of an act that one has chosen to perform. This means that the scope of our moral obligations may seem unfeasibly large1\nAnother counterintuitive aspect of consequentialism is its apparent imperviousness to considerations of justice. Suppose that we knew for a fact that capital punishment functions effectively as a deterrent: for each person executed, five murderers are deterred. To save resources, we might seize upon any random person, decree that they are the murderer, and execute them. Not only would this have the same deterrent effect, but it would also save police time and money since they would not need to track down the real culprit. A consequentialist would not worry about this, since the overall outcome may be deemed to outweigh the fact that one innocent person has been killed. But for many people, the injustice committed on the innocent man outweighs the beneficial consequences.\n\n\n\nCommunitarianism focuses on the fact that people have responsibilities as well as rights. It advocates policies based on consensus rather than compromise. It asserts that individuals need to concentrate not only on their own rights, but also their responsibilities to people close to them and to community. Communitarian arguments expect a concern for others to be taken into account when decisions are made. This approach comes to the fore when considering the health of communities rather than individuals. It is particularly relevant to public health ethics, genetics and any situation in which an important factor is the interrelatedness of individuals and of their interests.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘deontology’ stems from the Greek for ‘duty’. In contrast to consequentialism, a deontologist approaches ethical questions by identifying and adhering to predefined moral rules, or duties. Once we have established what our duty is, we must perform it, regardless of what the outcome may be. However, this raises the question of how we establish what our duties are.\nThe German philosopher Immanuel Kant argues that we can establish our moral duty purely through the exercise of reason without having to derive them from any theological source. This is known as ‘the categorical imperative’. To achieve this, Kant urges that in all of our decisions we should always behave in such a way that we could will for what we do to become a universal law. This means that we cannot treat our own interests as being superior to those of others. It also means that moral duties are consistent and non-arbitrary - they apply to everyone equally.\nIn utilitarian ethics, the most prominent status is given to the principle of beneficence. Kantian ethics, however, leads us to appreciate the individual, one’s free will, and rational responsibility for one’s decisions - the most important is, therefore, the ethical principle of the respect for autonomy. By requiring one to follow, without exception, universal rules, Kant excluded emotions and interpersonal relations from entering ethical reflections. Even more: an act is ethical only if the motivation comes from the general rule. If done from fear or love, the ethical value of the same act is neutral. In Kantian ethics, there is no place for compromise and no weighing of motivations for acting against the consequences, regardless of how predictable, and thus avoidable, the latter could be.\n\n\n\nIn ethical assessment, utilitarians look at the consequences of a particular act, and deontological ethicists at the conformity of the act with pre-defined rules. Virtue ethics stands in a different position: it’s foundation is the ethical characteristics of a person. Certain personal characteristics are recognized as virtues2 and others as vices. Honesty, generosity, compassion, courage, justice, fidelity, and veracity are virtues that characterize an ethical person, while deception, selfishness, cruelty, infidelity, and disingenuousness are some of the many characteristics that denote a vicious person.Virtue ethics is now regarded as being one of the three key moral theories, along with consequentialism and deontology.\nHowever, virtue ethics requires fundamentally that we have an idea of what the virtues are, and this can be difficult to establish. Certainly, Aristotle’s idea of the virtues does not necessarily harmonize with twenty-first century values. (Along with many other Greeks of his time, Aristotle thought that keeping slaves was perfectly compatible with being virtuous, and believed that women were intrinsically inferior to men.)\nVirtue ethics may be seen as an upgrading of utilitarian and deontological ethics. While virtues are in a central position, the incorporation of practical wisdom also rings consequences into virtue ethics. The rules of deontological ethics are important, yet not unbreakable. Finally, the main advantage of virtue ethics over the other two theories is that it includes human relations, and indeed gives a central position to them, a factor that has a decisive role in the practical reasoning of all of us.\n\n\n\nAnother practical approach is to use narrative or storytelling in order to give the problem context and clarify the ethical crux of it. This has been described as ‘the oldest way of exploring and expounding ethical issues’ through myth, parable or biography. It approaches problems by looking at the patient’s situation as a whole rather than considering a particular facet in isolation. It can involve an overview of the patient’s life, values and experiences of illness. Different health professionals and family members may present the picture from different angles and considering the same dilemma from such various viewpoints provides a way of ensuring that all relevant perspectives and perceptions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are influenced by ethics, the two can contradict one another in a healthcare setting. Law is based on explicit, written norms with a clear system for enacting such norms. Legal norms (approved international agreements, national constitutions, laws, and regulations) are organized hierarchically, should be mutually consistent, have a clearly defined spatial scope of their enactment, and can only apply to actions committed after the legal norm has been enacted. When an individual violates a specific legal norm, clearly defined procedures for establishing guilt and prescribed sanctions are in place.\nSometimes,legal duties as a healthcare professional can conflict with ethical responsibilities. The law may force ones do things their ethics just don’t condone. Or ones may want to do something because it’s ethical, but the law isn’t on their side."

The importance of this principle stems largely from the recognition that those same skills which allow a doctor to improve a patient’s health or well-being, can in themselves cause damage, pain, or sickness. Yet the injunction ‘first do no harm’ is perhaps too extreme. After all, if this really were a doctor’s first and primary obligation, they would not be able to do anything at all. It is impossible to think of any medical procedure or intervention that is entirely without risk. A simple vaccination causes harm by puncturing the skin; even screening may cause harm in the form of anxiety or a false-positive result. For this reason, it is clear that non-maleficence cannot function as medicine’s primary principle; rather, it serves as a balance against beneficence. Beneficence is an active principle - it calls for doctors to intervene to benefit their patients. Non-maleficence is a passive and cautionary principle that reminds doctors to think about the harm they may cause by intervening.\nQuestions of how to interpret “harm” also arise in the public health context. In recent years, some criticisms have been raised regarding breast screening. Frequently, screening programmes are justified on the ground that they save lives by detecting diseases which might otherwise have gone unnoticed until too late. However, in the breast screening context, it has been suggested that the screening programme causes excessive and unjustified interventions. In short, it causes harm. Some patients have biopsies only to discover there was nothing wrong. Others may have cancer detected, but in circumstances where the disease would never have become symptomatic. For example, if a very elderly patient has a very slow-growing cancer, it is highly unlikely that it will kill her. The question of whether such inadvertent harms outweigh the benefits of screening programmes is fraught. These problems, of course, also affect other moral theories that rely on concepts of harm, in particular consequentialism\n\n\n\nJustice is the principle of treating others fairly, avoiding discrimination and distributing resources equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-maleficence\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding discrimination, distributing re- sources fairly\n\n\n\nJustice differs from the three principles already discussed. Autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence are highly patient centred. However, most moral theories recognize that the individual is not the sole ethical concern. By its very nature, ethics is a social phenomenon, meaning that questions of fairness come into play. There are two primary ways in which the principle of justice affects ethical decision-making in medicine. Firstly, there is the issue of how other people may be affected by a particular decision. Secondly, there is the question of discrimination: do some patients receive better or worse treatment than others?\nTo comply with the requirements of justice, it is important that decision - making is transparent and consistent. This can be difficult in complex healthcare systems, serving patients whose needs and values vary widely.\nThe other facet of justice is discrimination. It is often assumed that discrimination is intrinsically wrong. Yet, if we never discriminated, we would be unable to function at all. Remembering Aristotle’s injunction, ’treat equals equally and unequals unequally’, it is clear that discrimination in itself is not a problem. It would be unjust to treat a patient with a broken neck exactly the same as one with a broken finger. Where needs are different, we should treat people differently. This involves discriminating: noticing those differences and making decisions accordingly.\nDiscrimination is only a problem when it is unjust. We have suggested it is appropriate to discriminate between patients with different needs; however, if it were decided that only dark-haired patients would be treated, this would clearly be unjust, since there is no connection between hair colour and need for treatment. The challenge, therefore, is to be able to recognize what are, and what are not, the sorts of inequalities that justify treating people differently"

    "text": "Real ethical dilemmas are those for which every possible action (including the omission of action) brings some ethical costs to a person, or to a group of people involved. Ethical analysis begins with a list of persons involved and then explores, for each of them, the ethical benefits and costs of a certain action according to the four ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. In this way, two or more possible actions with their ethical benefits and costs are compared. Ethical analysis does not automatically lead to the recommended action; rather, it is a practical approach to analyse a dilemma, identify the problematic aspects of each of the possible actions, and alleviate the related ethical costs.\nIf an act exists that will benefit all concerned and will not offend anybody, including oneself, then ethics or ethical analysis is not needed. Ethical consideration is also not applicable to situations in which the actor has no choice. Very often, however, we do have a choice; nevertheless, each act brings some benefits and some burdens to the persons whom the act involves.\nEthical analysis is helpful in such situations. The three steps of ethical analysis are:\n\nA list of possible actions\nList of persons or groups of persons whom the actions concern\nPreparing a table with rows for each person or group of persons concerned and columns for the four ethical principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco, aged 3, was seriously hurt in a traffic accident. Upon arrival to the intensive-care unit, he is in severe hemorrhagic shock. His father, a Jehovah’s Witness, prohibits blood transfusion, even after being told that immediate blood transfusion, followed by an operation is the only possibility for survival. The physician has to decide whether he will order blood transfusion or follow the father’s demand.\n\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are blood transfusion against the father’s will or no transfusion.\nThe persons involved are Marco, his family, and the physician. In addition, we will also add to the list the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses since they might be hurt if they learn that their religious belief was ignored. This brings us to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco’s family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysician\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s\nWitnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician’s decision to apply blood transfusion against the father’s will is to be compared to the alternative option - no transfusion, which would almost certainly lead to Marco’s death. We will now insert ethical benefits, marked with a “+”, and ethical costs, marked with a “−”. Assessment of ethical benefits and costs is clearly subjective; however, subjectivity is an unavoidable characteristic of every ethical deliberation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nMarco\n?\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nMarco’s family\n---\n+++\n+++\n++\n\n\nPhysician\n+++\n++\n++\n\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n–\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the ethical benefits of a transfusion against the father’s demand greatly outweigh the ethical costs. The physician in the intensive-care unit has to make decisions without delay which gives Marco a chance for survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian, aged 12, has been treated for neuroblastoma for two years. Despite intensive treatment with three lines of cytotoxic drugs, he is now in relapse. Physicians agree that there is no indication for further active treatment and recommend only supportive and palliative treatment. Due to anaemia, Damian is weak and dizzy. A blood transfusion might lead to short-term improvement of his symptoms but clearly cannot reverse the course of the disease. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, his parents refuse blood transfusion.\n\n\n\nThe possible actions are a transfusion against the parents’ will or no transfusion. The persons involved are Damian, his family, the physician, and the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Here is the table, as prepared for the decision to order blood transfusion against the will of the parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nDamian\n--\n?\n+\n?\n\n\nDamian’s family\n---\n--\n--\n---\n\n\nPhysician\n+\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nThe community of Jehovah’s Witnesses\n---\n---\n--\n---\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the transfusion brings very few benefits and severe ethical costs, which no lengthy explanation can reduce. As a teenager, Damian understands the religion in which he was raised. For the parents, the extremely painful experience of the imminent death of their child would be even worse due to a lack of respect from physician’s side. Their sorrow and anger might spread to the whole community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.\nIt is clear that ethical analysis involves both ethical and professional arguments and it is a strong tool against one-sided presentation of ethical dilemmas. Attention to a single dimension, most often to respect for individual autonomy, should not obscure the ethical benefits and costs for other persons whose interests are also at stake. It is clear that ethical benefits and costs are subject to individual interpretation. Ethics is not mathematics, and conclusions from an ethical analysis may be debatable, based on different professional arguments. Thus, ethical analysis does not provide a single answer, but rather a framework for balancing and reaching a rational conclusion."

    "text": "Ten medical students are learning how to perform rectal examinations. This is important for their education. However, no one likes undergoing a rectal examination unnecessarily. To ensure that students get the necessary practice, the consultant who is teaching them is trying to decide whether to allow these ten students to practise a rectal examination on 96-year-old anaesthetized woman who is undergoing surgery for an unrelated issue. The woman, who has mental capacity, has not been informed nor has she given consent. Is this ethically acceptable?\n\n\nPerforming a medical procedure on a patient who has not agreed to this may seem deceptive. Doctors are usually expected to be honest and trust-worthy and act with integrity. These are virtues that are explicitly required by the General Medical Council (GMC). Nevertheless, students may be well motivated in wanting to carry out the procedure: doing so should enable them to be better doctors in future. It seems reasonable to suppose that no one has ill intentions towards the patient in question; the procedure is not intended to harm her, and she need never know what has been done to her. However, a wise consultant may be able to exercise a more discerning judgement. Although no ill intention is involved, harm may come to the patient. Such harm, if she was not asked for her consent, will come as a shock. Though a very low-risk procedure, a rectal examination is something that carries a strong taboo in our society. The patient if she discovers she has undergone this may feel outraged or violated. We can never be entirely sure that a patient will not discover something we would prefer was kept secret. The patient’s virtues should also be considered here. If she had been asked, and had agreed to let the students examine her, this would have been a virtuous decision on her part. However, if the students examine her without her knowledge or consent, she has no opportunity to exercise virtue.\n\n\n\nFor a consequentialist, the question of whether the patient agrees to undergo the procedure is irrelevant. As long as she never finds out, no harm is done. If the action benefits ten medical students, this may be enough. Although, of course, it would be different if the procedure causes the patient harm (as it might on a 96-year-old patient), then the procedure could not be justified. However, a utilitarian must also consider the harm that might arise if the patient does find out - the patient may be distressed and angry. Patient negative experience could outweigh the benefit to the medical students. There are also broader harms and benefits to consider. If patients learn that they may be ‘practised on’ while under anaesthetic, they may lose trust in hospitals. But if no one ever finds out, perhaps overall large numbers of patients could benefit, since students will have the chance to improve their skills. If we could be 100% certain that the patient would never find out, the consequentialist would be completely happy to advise the ten students to proceed with their examination\n\n\n\nIt should immediately be apparent that a deontologist would not allow medical students to practise on an unconscious patient without her consent. This would be disregarding her autonomy, as well as being deceptive. However, would obtaining consent in advance make a difference, given that students would still be ‘using’ the patient for their own practice? Given the previous points about autonomy and consent, it seems plausible that a deontologist would be happy for the students to practise on the patient if she had consented in advance. If the patient consents, she shares in the ends of the students, that is, their desire to become better doctors, and this becomes one of her own ends.\n\n\n\nClearly, performing examinations on a patient without her consent is not in keeping with respect for autonomy. However, if this is known to be a teaching hospital, perhaps we could assume that consent to training is implied by this patient’s presence in the hospital. If so, then the procedure may not be deemed to breach the patient’s autonomy at all.\nOne might argue that the procedure is non-maleficent, and could even be beneficent if by chance it picks up something that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. It could also be argued that the broader benefits of carrying out such training in terms of improving population health could be taken to outweigh the other principles, that is, justice might decree that all patients should be willing to undergo this kind of thing for the sake of a wider population benefit.\nHowever, there are a number of issues to consider here. The first issue is whether it is reasonable to infer consent from a patient’s presence in a teaching hospital. Doctors often make this argument, but it is highly questionable. Many members of the public may not be aware of whether their nearest hospital is a teaching hospital or not. Even if they are, there is no reason to assume that they will know that this means they will be exposed to students’ examinations. Therefore, unless the patient has been explicitly consulted, it is not reasonable to suppose that she has somehow consented to being examined while under anaesthetic.\nThe arguments related to beneficence and non-maleficence likewise seem weak when probed further. It is unlikely that the examinations will cause harm; yet there is always some degree of risk and this may be exacerbated by the patient’s anger and distress if she feels she’s been abused or deceived.\nThe question about beneficence is very significant here. Some patients do not wish to know if they have a particular condition, and would choose not to attend screening programmes for this reason. The know-ledge of having a serious medical condition, though regarded as beneficial by many people, can be regarded as harmful by others. This is why people are offered screening, rather than being compelled to participate. If something sinister were identified in this woman, we do not know if she would be grateful or angry and upset about having been denied a choice.\nFinally, it is undoubtedly an admirable thing to participate in research or training. Surprisingly many patients are willing to do this when asked directly. Their choice to be involved may be described as truly altruistic. But when no choice is given, the act is not altruistic. There may also be questions to ask about why this patient in particular is being selected for this training. This is where considerations of justice can be extremely useful in identifying hidden ethical problems. What role is this patient’s age playing here? Has she been chosen as an ‘easy’ option?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy\nNon-maleficence\nBeneficence\nJustice\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n-/?\n-\n+\n---\n\n\nStudents\n+\n---\n+++\n+"

Courage, for example, lies midway between the extremes of cowardice on the one hand, and recklessness on the other. Applying this to medical ethics, we might say that a doctor who lacks courage may not fulfil our idea of what it means to be a virtuous doctor; they might not be willing to challenge accepted practices or protocols. A doctor who is overly courageous on the other hand might be unable to recognize the risks that she is embracing. She may become arrogant in her conviction that her way is right.↩︎\nAn off-duty plumber has no moral obligation to fix a dripping radiator in a restaurant where he is eating.

Например, когато измерваме помпената функция на сърцето можем да измерим количеството кръв, което постъпва в аортата, след едно сърдечно съкращение. Това е абсолютната величина ударен обем. Хората с по-висок ръст и по-високо тегло (по-едро телосложение) имат по-високи стойности на усърдния обем, спрямо тези с по-нисък ръст и по-малко тегло. Така например сърцето на състезател по сумо изтласква по-голямо количество кръв (в милилитри), спрямо сърцето на първокласник. Означава ли това, че сърцето на сумиста работи по-добре от това на първокласника? Отговорът е, че не можем да преценим - двете абсолютни величини не бива да се сравняват директно. Затова по-важното, в случая е съотношението на ударният обем, спрямо количеството кръв налично в сърцето, точно преди неговото съкращение. Това е т.н “фракция на изтласкване” и представлява относителна величина."

С други думи, показателят представя честотата на една статистическа съвкупност (смъртните случаи) върху друга съвкупност (болните деца).\nСмъртността представлява съотношение на броя на починалите, спрямо средния брой население. Смъртността по причини представлява броя на починалите от дадено заболяването, разделен на броя на всички починали.

Защо да предпочетем едната спрямо другата? Какво е правилото?\nВсъщност, няма особено значение точно коя структура се избира. Разбира се, числата след стандартизация зависят от избора и те биха се различавали. От значение, обаче е разликата, а не конкретните стойности на стандартизиран леталитет в двете групи 3\nКакво обаче е стандартът?\nАко изберем за стандарт групата на неваксинираните, за да изчислим стандарта - ще използваме броя на участниците във всяка възрастова група за числител, а общия брой неваксинирани за знаменател. Полученият коефициент е “стандарт” за конкретната възрастова група.\nВ Таблица 4 са представени получените стандарти.\nНеваксинираните участниците под 24 год. са 4000, а общият брой неваксинирани 8000. Стандартът за тази група е 0.5 (ако умножим по 100 ще получим 50%). Това е стандартът за тази група, които обаче ще използваме и за ваксинираните.\nМоже да ви направи впечатление, че сборът на всички стандарти е равен на 1-ца (тоест 100%).

За сметка на това стандартизираните се събират. Когато ги съберем получаваме общия стандартизиран леталитет, който е “изчистен” от замъгляващия ефект на различната възраст в двете групи. С други думи, показателите след стандартизация, представят какъв би бил леталитетът, ако двете групи имаха еднаква възрастова структура.\n\n\nСтъпка 4: Заключение\nНека извършим тази последна калкулация.\nЗа групата на ваксинираните общият стандартизиран леталитет е:\n\n25 % (стандартизираният леталитет за всички до 24 г.) + 15 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 25-34 г.) + 8,7 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 35-44 г.) + 10 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група над 45 г.). Общо за всички ваксинирани, стандартизираният леталитет е 58.7%\n\nЗа групата на неваксинираните общият стандартизиран леталитет е:\n\n30 % (стандартизираният леталитет за всички до 24 г.) + 17,5 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 25-34 г.) + 10 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група от 35-44 г.) + 11,25 % (стандартизираният леталитет за възрастовата група над 45 г.). Общо за всички ваксинирани, стандартизираният леталитет е 65.75%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЗаключение\n\n\n\n\n\nСтандартизираните показатели за леталитет в двете групи са съответно 58.75 % и 68.75 %. Леталитетът сред неваксинираните, е с 10 % по-висок.\n\n\n\n\nСтандартизираните показатели позволяват да се анализира и оцени нивото на изучаваното явление при създадени условия на еднородност, тоест методът ни показва какви биха били коефициентите, в сравняваните групи, ако те имаха еднакъв състав."

    "title": "Epidemiology – definition, tasks, methods. Natural history of the disease",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Epidemiology - Definition\nEpidemiology is a medical science and practical approach that is an integral part of social medicine and public health. The word originates from the Greek - “epi” - above, “demos” - people, and “logos” - science. Epidemiology studies the causes of diseases and their distribution in the population. The definition is based on two fundamental assumptions: frist, the occurrence of diseases in populations is not a purely random process, and second, it is determined by causal and preventive factors\n\n\nHistorical Development of Epidemiology\n\nThe historical development of this science can be traced back to the time of Hippocrates. In his three books titled “Epidemics I”, “Epidemics III”, and “On Airs, Waters, and Places”, Hippocrates attempted to describe disease from a rational perspective rather than as a supernatural manifestation. He observed that different diseases occurred in different places and introduced concepts such as epidemics and endemics.\nHowever, the “father” of modern epidemiology is considered to be the English physician-anesthesiologist John Snow (1813–1858). While his name is associated with the application of chloroform for anesthesia, including for Queen Victoria, Snow is better known for his pioneering work in epidemiology. Twenty years before the development of the microscope, Snow conducted studies on cholera outbreaks to discover the cause of the disease and prevent its recurrence. As his work illustrates the classical sequence from descriptive epidemiology to hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing (analytical epidemiology), and application of knowledge in practical health measures, two of his studies will be described in detail.\n\nSnow conducted one of his famous investigations in 1854 when a cholera outbreak occurred in Golden Square, London. He began his investigation by determining where the cholera patients lived and worked in that area. He mapped out each residence on a map of the area. Believing that water was the source of cholera infection, Snow marked the locations of the water pumps on his map (designated with the Latin letters A, B, C). He then sought a connection between the distribution of households with cholera cases and the location of the pumps. He observed that more households with cholera cases were clustered around pump “A” - the Broad Street pump, than around pumps “B” or “C”. When he interviewed residents living in the vicinity of Golden Square, they told him they avoided pump B because it was heavily polluted, and pump C was inconveniently located for most of them. Based on this information, Snow concluded that the Broad Street pump (pump A) was the primary source of water for the region and the most likely source of infection for most cholera patients in the Golden Square area. However, he curiously noted that in the area of two blocks located east of the Broad Street pump, there were no cases of cholera. Upon investigation, Snow discovered that there was a brewery with a deep well located there. The brewery workers obtained water from this well, as well as a daily ration of malt alcohol. Access to these uncontaminated wells may explain why none of the brewery employees were infected with cholera. To confirm that the Broad Street pump was the source of the epidemic, Snow gathered information on where the cholera patients obtained water. Consumption of water from the Broad Street pump was the only common factor among cholera patients. After presenting his findings to municipal officials, despite some resistance, the pump was removed, and the pandemic outbreaks ceased. The site of the pump is now marked with a memorial plaque.\nSnow’s second investigation reexamines the data from the 1854 cholera epidemic in London. During the cholera epidemic a few years earlier, Snow noticed that areas with the highest mortality were served by two water supply companies: the Lambeth Company and the Southwark and Vauxhall Company. At that time, both companies obtained water from the River Thames at intake points located downstream from London, making them susceptible to contamination from London sewage, which was directly discharged into the river. To avoid contamination from London sewage, in 1852 the Lambeth Company relocated its intake to a location considerably upstream from London. Over a period of 7 weeks in the summer of 1854, Snow compared the cholera mortality rates in areas supplied by one or both water supply companies. Snow’s collected data showed that the cholera mortality was more than 5 times higher in areas served exclusively by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company (downstream intake from London) than in areas served only by the Lambeth Company (upstream intake from London). These data were consistent with the hypothesis that water obtained from the Thames below London was a source of cholera. To test his hypothesis regarding water supply, Snow focused on areas served by both companies, as households within these areas were usually comparable, except for the water supply company. In these areas, Snow first determined the water supply company for each household where a cholera death had occurred during the 7-week period. Upon analyzing the data, a higher cholera mortality was found among households served by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, supporting Snow’s hypothesis. This systematic approach has actually been used by modern epidemiologists to investigate disease outbreaks. Following this investigation, efforts to control the epidemic were directed towards relocating the water intake of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company to avoid sources of contamination. In this way, without knowledge of microorganisms, Snow demonstrated that water could serve as a means of transmitting cholera and that epidemiological information could be used to guide prompt and appropriate public health actions.\n\n\n\n\nConcepts\n\nEpidemiology may be considered as minor to physical sciences because it does not investigate the biological mechanism leading from exposure to disease as, for example, toxicology does. However, the ability of identifying modifiable conditions that contribute to health outcomes without identifying the biological mechanisms or the agent(s) that lead to these outcomes is a strength of epidemiology: It is not always necessary to wait until the underlying mechanism is completely understood in order to facilitate preventive action. This is illustrated by the historical examples of the improvements of environmental hygiene that led to a reduction of infectious diseases like cholera that was possible before the identifciation of vibrio cholerae.\nWhat distinguishes epidemiology is its perspective on groups or populations rather than individuals. It is this demographic focus where statistical methods enter the feild and provide the tools needed to compare different characteristics relating to disease occurrence between populations. Epidemiology is a comparative discipline that contrasts occurrence of diseases and characteristics between different time periods, different places, or different groups of persons. The comparison of groups is a central feature of epidemiology, be it the comparison of morbidity or mortality in populations with and without a certain exposure or the comparison of exposure between diseased subjects and a control group. Inclusion of an appropriate reference group (non-exposed or non-diseased) for comparison with the group of interest is a condition for causal inference.\n\n\n\nApplication of Epidemiological Knowledge\nEpidemiological knowledge concerns populations. There are two ways to use this knowledge. The frist is group-oriented: It consists in applying knowledge about a specifcic population directly to this population itself. This is part of public health. The conceptually simplest applications of this kind concern the planning of the health system and of health strategies. The second path is taken when we are confronted with an individual person, typically in a clinical setting: We can then regard this person as a member of a population for which relevant epidemiological knowledge is available and deal with her or him accordingly.\n\n\nDifference between Epidemiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases\n\nUnlike the specialty of “Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases” (EID), general epidemiology (GE) focuses on one population.\nIn general epidemiology, risk factors are understood as elements with an increased risk of developing a disease, while EID considers the infected individual as a “risk factor” for others.\nEssentially, GE attempts to discover the causes of diseases and assess their impact on the population, while in EID, the causes are known (infectious agent).\n\n\n\nObjectives of Epidemiology\nEpidemiology pursues three major objectives:\n\nto describe the spectrum of diseases and their determinants\nto identify the causal factors of diseases\nto apply this knowledge to prevention and public health practice.\n\n\n\nTasks of Epidemiology:\n\nIdentifying risk factors that influence health and providing scientific support for health promotion and prevention.\nDetermining the significance and priority of various factors affecting health.\nIdentifying populations at risk for specific diseases.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic programs.\nStudying the natural course of diseases.\nRegistering and tracking the frequency of diseases.\nInvestigating disease outbreaks (“epidemic”) requires examining the extreme acting risk factor.\n\n\n\nNatural History of Disease\n\nDefinition - The natural history of disease represents a simplified model of the development of a disease from the moment of exposure to the risk factor to the final stage of chronicity, death, or recovery. The natural history (NH) of disease is one of the fundamental concepts in epidemiology. NH includes the following stages:\nStages:\n\nFirst Stage - susceptibility stage. This stage occurs before a person develops a certain disease. During this stage, the individual is susceptible to the disease but has not yet been exposed to the risk factor.\nSecond Stage - exposure stage. During this stage, the individual is exposed to the risk factor. The risk factor may act with a small dose and over a prolonged period (occupational risk factors - microclimate, vibrations; smoking) or with a very high dose over a short period (poisoning, radiation, electric shocks).\nThird Stage - asymptomatic period. During this stage, the individual does not exhibit symptoms but has developed the disease. In this stage, the individual may fully recover without seeking contact with the healthcare system. In infectious diseases, the individual may be infectious during this period. Usually, this period ends with the onset of clinical symptoms, prompting the seeking of medical assistance.\nFourth Stage - clinical diagnosis. In this stage, the individual seeks medical help. For some diseases, the clinical diagnosis may be made based solely on clinical symptoms, while for others, additional diagnostic procedures (laboratory, radiological, tomographic, biopsy, etc.) may be necessary. This period can be exceptionally long for some rare diseases or clinical entities not described until now. In 30% of cases, a diagnosis may not be made due to a lack of sufficient medical knowledge in the field.\nFifth Stage - disease development. During this period, after diagnosis, the individual begins etiological, pathogenetic, and/or symptomatic treatment. The disease develops according to the specifics of the organism and the effectiveness of the applied therapy.\nSixth Stage - Outcome of the disease. During this period, the individual may fully recover, partially recover - with limited functional abilities (chronification), or pass away.\n\nApplication of the Natural History of Disease\n\nDevelopment of preventive programs. Understanding the natural history of a disease can help determine the stages of the disease where interventions can be most effective in preventing its spread. For example, if the disease has a long latent period, interventions aimed at detecting and treating the disease during this stage can be effective in preventing transmission.\nEffective treatment. Knowing the natural history of a disease can help healthcare providers choose appropriate treatment at each stage of the disease. For example, medications may be more effective in the early stages of the disease than in later stages when irreversible damage may occur.\nPrognosis for disease outcome. Understanding the natural history of a particular disease can help predict the likely outcome for each patient depending on their personal characteristics and health status. This information can be used to make treatment decisions and to counsel patients and their families.\nDisease control. Understanding the natural history of a disease is essential for developing strategies to control or eliminate the disease. For example, in the case of an infectious disease, identifying the stages of the disease where transmission is most likely can serve as information for interventions aimed at controlling its sprea."

It is essential that informing and involving patients, in a way that they can understand, is not seen as ‘additional’ to medical practice, but as an integral part of it. In much of healthcare, informed patients indicate their consent through actions, such as opening their mouth for examination, offering an arm for blood pressure to be taken or attending a doctor and giving information about an illness. Consent that is indicated in this way is often termed ‘implied’ consent and applies only to the immediate procedure, and not necessarily to subsequent tests or treatment that flow from it. However, acquiescence when a patient does not know what the intervention entails, or that there is an option of refusing, is not ‘consent’. Consent that is given orally, in writing or via other means of communication available to the patient, is known as ‘explicit’, or ‘express’, consent. A signed consent form is simply prima facie evidence that the process of information giving and explanation has taken place. It is the quality and clarity of the information provided, along with the capacity of the patient and the voluntariness of the consent given, which determine the its validity, rather than a signature on a piece of paper."

Doctors contribute their clinical knowledge and experience while patients bring their personal needs, preferences and values to the decision-making process. In some cases, however, patients do not want to know and ask their doctor to make the decision on their behalf. When this happens, doctors should try to find out why the patient feels this way, and explain the importance of knowing the options open to them and what the treatment will involve. Even if they continue to refuse, it is a legal requirement that basic information, such as what the treatment or procedure is intended to achieve and what it will involve, including any serious risks, be provided in order for consent to be valid. If patients insist that they do not want even this basic information, the doctor must explain the potential consequences of not receiving it; for example, their consent to the treatment or procedure may not be valid. Doctors must record the fact that a patient has declined basic information and make it clear to patients that they can change their minds and have more information at any time.\nWithout basic information, patients cannot make a valid choice to delegate responsibility for treatment decisions to the doctor. The amount of basic information needed depends upon the individual circumstances, the severity of the condition and the risks associated with the treatment. Some doctors ask patients to sign a form confirming that they were offered information but declined it, both in order to emphasize the importance of the decision the patient is taking and to protect the doctor against future charges of failing to provide sufficient information. Others record each discussion that takes place in the medical notes.

    "text": "The scope of consent\n\nDuration\nConsent should be perceived as a continuing process rather than a one-off decision. Before beginning treatment, a member of the healthcare team should check that the patient still wants to go ahead. Doctors sometimes query the length of time for which consent is valid. In usual practice, this is not an issue because patients’ continued participation in treatment is an indication that they have not changed their minds. Occasionally, however, if treatment involves a number of invasive or complex procedures over a period of time, for example successive surgical interventions, it may be appropriate to ask for explicit, or even written, consent for each intervention. Sometimes there is a long period between the original consent being sought and the procedure being undertaken, during which time the patient’s condition or wishes may have changed, or new information may have become available. It is then important to reaffirm that the patient still consents to the procedure going ahead, even if no new information or explanations are needed. It is important that the patient is given continuing opportunities to ask further questions and to review the decision.\n\n\nExceeding consent\nConsent is valid only insofar as it applies to the treatment in question; so, for example, when a patient agrees to a surgical procedure, the surgeon cannot simply change their mind and perform a different or additional operation. If the patient signs a consent form for an operation on her left knee, you cannot, in the operating room, decide to operate on her right knee and assume that you have consent. If a patient signs a consent for an appendectomy, but when you open her up you find colon cancer, you cannot just do the colectomy without first informing the patient of the additional procedure and obtaining consent. There can be no presumption for consent for anything beyond what the patient specifically said they consented to. Either the patient has to sign consent in advance for the other procedures or they have to regain consciousness and have the additional procedure explained.\nThe only time when doctors are justified in proceeding without prior authority is when it is essential to do so immediately in order to save life or prevent a serious deterioration in the patient’s condition, and it is not possible to obtain that person’s consent."

Just as patients giving consent should have sufficient accurate information, those refusing should ideally have an awareness of their condition, the proposed treatment, any significant risks or side effects, the probability of a successful recovery, the consequences of not having the treatment and alternative forms of treatment. Doctors must not put pressure on patients to decide in a particular way, but should allow them time to consider a decision with potentially serious consequences.\nA refusal of a particular treatment does not imply a refusal of all treatment or all facets of care. When a patient has refused treatment, alternative treatments and procedures intended to keep the patient comfortable and free from pain or discomfort should still be offered. In addition, patients are entitled to change their minds about a decision, including a refusal, at any time, so long as they have the capacity to do so. If there are circumstances in which not providing treatment at a given time would limit the options for providing treatment in the future, this should be made clear from the outset. For example, a cancer may be operable at the time a patient presents for treatment; if the patient refuses and then changes his or her mind a month later, the cancer might have progressed to a stage that is inoperable."

    "section": "Capacity to give valid consent",
    "text": "Capacity to give valid consent\nCompetence is a legal term. Competency decisions transpire within the judicial system. Only a court can determine that a patient is incompetent. All adult patients are considered competent unless specifically proven otherwise. Physicians can determine whether or not a patient has the capacity to understand their medical condition. The physician makes a determination of the capacity to comprehend patients medical problems based on whether there is an organic delirium due to a clinical condition such as hypoxia, drug intoxication, meningitis, encephalitis, or a psychiatric disorder. These determinations are based in large part on a neurological tests on memory, comprehension, reasoning, and judgment. Any physician can make this determination not only psychiatrist. However, psychiatrist may be useful in rendering decision-making capacity determinations in cases that are complex or equivocal. If the patient obviously does or does not have the capacity to understand, a psychiatrist is not needed.\n\nMinors\nBy definition, a minor is a person under the age of 18. With some exceptions, minors are generally not considered competent to make their own decisions. Only a parent or a legal guardian can give consent for a minor. Neighbors, aunts, uncles, and grandparents cannot give consent. This rule does not cover life-threatening or serious emergencies. Consent is always implied for emergency treatment. A physician should not withhold blood or surgery in a life-threatening accident just because the parent is not present.\nA small number of minors, particularly at older ages such as 16 or 17, may be considered “emancipated” or freed of the need to have parental consent for any medical care. The criteria are that the minor is married, self-supporting and living independently, in the military, or the parent of a child that they themselves support. The criteria for being an emancipated minor relate to being no longer dependent on one’s parents for support. In other words, if the minor does not live with their parents, has a job, and is self-supporting financially, then the minor no longer is dependent upon parental consent for his actions. An emancipated minor is free to make health-care decisions in all areas, not only just STDs, prenatal care, contraception, or substance abuse.\n\n\nPsychiastric patients\nAll suicidal patients are considered to lack capacity to understand because active suicidal ideation is deemed to be a sign of impaired judgment. In addition, the level of competence necessary to make financial decisions is different from that necessary for an informed refusal. In other words, a patient may have a history of bipolar disorder making it impossible for him to manage financial decisions. However, the same person might still be considered to have capacity to refuse treatment. There is a very limited demand placed on patients to establish capacity to refuse treatments.\n\n\nProxy decision making and the role of those close to the patient\nWhen patients lack the capacity to make decisions, others clearly need to make it on their behalf. Families and those close to the adult often feel that they are the natural decision makers, but the law is clear that they are only entitled to consent where they have been appointed as the patient’s proxy decision maker. Surrogate decision-making does not refer to the ethical principle of autonomy, but rather to the ethical principle of beneficence. When making a decision about a medical procedure for my child or for my elderly parents with dementia, one should not defend a decision that would be harmful. Children are not parents’ property, and parents share the duty to act in their best interests. The physician has the right and the duty to defend a child or another person with limited autonomy when a surrogate decision-maker acts against the patient’s best interests. In cases of disagreement, the interests of the child, or of another person with limited autonomy should prevail. The most appropriate resolution of such a disagreement is a rapid court decision.\n\n\nAdvanced Directives\nIn cases of limited autonomy, the patient’s advanced directive is the second possibility to support a medical decision. Advanced directives are a logical consequence of the clash between the widening options of modern medical technologies to prolong life, and the increasing awareness of the right to control one’s own life, here including dignity when approaching the end of life.\nElderly, or patients with severe chronic diseases often wish to express their preference regarding treatment in case of future incompetence and deterioration of their health. Since nobody can envision all possible future scenarios, the contents of such advance directives are usually quite broad and include statements such as refusal to be admitted to an intensive-care unit, or refusal of resuscitation.\nWhile advanced written directives remain rare in many countries (including Bulgaria), it is clear that this practice will become more common in future. Advanced directives may be written and signed, sometimes in the presence of a family physician. They may also be expressed orally, preferably in the presence of at least two witnesses. An advanced directive has no absolute validity. First, there is a time limit: many laws and regulations limit the validity of patients’ advanced directives to 5 years, after which the person should renew its validity. Physician should always strive to understand whether the patient really envisioned the current situation at the time when formulating an advanced directive. The nature of the current medical problem is important: while a successful antibiotic treatment of acute pneumonia may quickly return the patient to her previous state, such a scenario is clearly different from a decision to start long-lasting artificial ventilation. Even when presented with a clear advanced directive, the physician should speak to a frail patient and try to get his or her current preference."

    "text": "Definitions\n\nIllness - Refers to the actual manifestation of a pathological condition or disease in an individual. It encompasses the symptoms and signs experienced by the person and is often the reason for seeking medical attention or treatment.\nDisease - Describes a pathological condition or disorder that involves a disturbance in the normal functioning of the body or its organs. It may be characterized by specific symptoms, signs, or abnormalities that can be diagnosed by healthcare professionals through clinical examination, laboratory tests, or imaging studies.\nSickness - This term is often used interchangeably with illness or disease and generally refers to a state of poor health or being unwell. It can encompass both physical and mental aspects of health and well-being and may involve various symptoms, discomfort, or impairment of normal activities.\nMorbidity Iceberg - The Morbidity Iceberg, often referred to simply as the “Iceberg of Disease,” is a conceptual model used in epidemiology and public health to illustrate the discrepancy between reported or diagnosed cases of a disease and the actual total number of cases within a population. It is called an “iceberg” because, like an iceberg, only a small portion is visible above the surface, while the majority remains hidden beneath.\n\nVisible Portion: This represents the reported or diagnosed cases of a particular disease. These are the cases that have come to the attention of healthcare providers, typically through seeking medical care or through active surveillance by public health authorities. These cases are recorded in official health records and databases.\nHidden Portion: This refers to the undetected or unreported cases of the disease within the population. These cases may go unnoticed for various reasons, such as mild symptoms that do not prompt individuals to seek medical attention, lack of access to healthcare services, underdiagnosis by healthcare providers, or asymptomatic infections. Additionally, some cases may be misdiagnosed or not properly documented.\nFactors Contributing to the Hidden Portion:\n\nAccess to Healthcare\nDiagnostic Practices\nStigma and Social Factors\nAsymptomatic Cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Disease Iceberg. The visible part of the iceberg of disease is a collection of discovered and diagnosed diseases known to the health service. The invisible part is a collection of diseases for which medical assistance has not been sought.\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Diseases\n\nAbsolute Number of Cases - Has limited significance in epidemiology. It is useful for administrative purposes, but it does not provide a measure of the magnitude of the problem in the population.\nFrequency Coefficients - Two types of frequency coefficients are used in epidemiology: the incidence and the prevalence.\n\nIncidence - Measures the rate of occurrence of new cases of a disease in a defined population over a specified period.\nPrevalence - Measures the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time.\n\nProportions - Structural, extensive indicators where the numerator is a part of the denominator. Expressed as a percentage (%).\n\n\n\nMeasures of Exposure:\n\nRelative Risk\nAtributive Risk\nOdds Ratio\nRisk Difference (Attributable Risk)\nAttributable Fraction in the Exposed\nPopulation Attributable Risk\nPopulation Attributable Fraction\n\n\n\nDisease Incidence\n\nDefinition: Incidence is a dynamic measure that assesses the frequency of new cases of a disease during a specified period in a population at risk.\nTypes of Indicators:\n\nIncidence Rate: This indicator provides insight into the rate at which new cases of a disease occur within a population over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of disease or injury during a specified period by the total time each person was observed, summed for all individuals in the population at risk. This measure is often expressed per unit time (e.g., per 1,000 person-years). A higher incidence rate indicates a higher risk of acquiring the disease within the population.\\[I_{rate} = \\frac{new~cases~of~disease~or~injury~during~specified~period}{Time~each~person~was~observed~totaled~for~all~people}\\cdot{10}^n \\]\nCumulative Incidence: This indicator offers a broader perspective by measuring the proportion of individuals who develop the disease within the initial population at risk over a specified period. Also known as the attack rate or risk, cumulative incidence is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of disease or injury by the size of the population at the start of the period. This measure provides a clear understanding of the risk of developing the disease within a defined population during a specific timeframe. \\[CI = \\frac{New~cases~of~disease~or~injury}{Size~of~population~at~start~of~period}\\cdot{10}^n \\cdot t\\]\n\nSignificance:\n\nIncreased Incidence: An increase in disease incidence may indicate various factors such as strong acting risk factors (e.g., exposure to radiation, natural disasters), low levels of prevention (e.g., lack of vaccination, poor sanitation), or epidemiological outbreaks (e.g., infectious diseases). Monitoring changes in disease incidence can help identify emerging health threats and inform public health interventions.\nDecreased Incidence: A decrease in disease incidence may result from effective prevention strategies (primarily primary prevention) and the efficient organization of healthcare services. It indicates successful efforts in reducing the risk of disease within a population and improving overall health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nDisease Prevalence\n\nDefinition: Prevalence, sometimes referred to as the frequency of occurrence, represents the proportion of individuals in a given population who have a specific disease or condition at a particular point in time or over a specified period. Unlike incidence, which focuses solely on new cases, prevalence includes both new and pre-existing cases at a given moment. The formula for prevalence is \\[P= \\frac{all~new~cases~and~pre-existing~cases~of~disease~or~injury}{Population~during~the~same~time~period}\\cdot{10}^n\\]\nTypes of Indicators:\n\nPoint Prevalence: This indicator measures the proportion of individuals with a specific disease or condition on a particular date.\nPeriod Prevalence: This indicator measures the proportion of individuals with a specific disease or condition at any time during a specific interval.\n\nSignificance:\n\nDistinguishing Prevalence from Incidence:\n\nThe numerator of incidence consists only of individuals whose disease began within a specified interval.\nThe numerator of prevalence includes all individuals who have the disease for a specific reason during the specified interval, regardless of when the disease started. It includes not only new cases but also pre-existing cases, representing individuals who remained ill for some part of the specified interval.\n\nFactors Influencing Prevalence:\n\nIncreased Prevalence: Prevalence tends to increase with longer durations of diseases (chronic conditions), lower disease mortality rates, more effective therapies for maintaining health, increased exposure to risk factors, immigration of sick or predisposed individuals, emigration of healthy individuals, and advancements in diagnostic methods.\nDecreased Prevalence: Prevalence decreases with diseases with high mortality rates, acute conditions with rapid recovery, reduction in disease incidence, immigration of healthy individuals, and emigration of sick individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Exposure\n\n\nRelative Risk\n\nDefinition: Relative risk is a measure of the association between a particular disease or condition and the factor or exposure under investigation. It represents the ratio of the incidence of the disease among the exposed to the incidence of the disease among the unexposed group. It serves as a measure of the strength of the relationship between the factor and the disease. The values can range from 0 to + infinity.\nFormula: \\[RR = \\frac{I_{e}}{I_{unex}}\\]\nInterpretation:\n\nRelative Risk = 1 means that the incidence among the exposed is equal to the incidence among the unexposed, indicating no association between the exposure and the disease.\nA value greater than 1 indicates that the incidence among the exposed is higher compared to that among the unexposed, meaning that the exposure is a factor that increases the likelihood of developing the disease.\nA relative risk value less than 1 indicates a lower incidence among the unexposed, meaning that the exposure reduces the likelihood of developing the disease, indicating a protective effect.\n\n\n\n\nAtributive Risk\n\nDefinition: Attributable risk is the rate (proportion) of a disease or other outcome in exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure. This is a more useful term for public health purposes as it reflects the amount, usually expressed as a percentage, by which the risk of a disease is reduced by elimination or control of a particular exposure. Using attributable risk, it is possible to estimate the number of people spared the consequences of exposure, by subtracting the rate of the outcome (usually incidence or mortality) among the unexposed from the rate among the exposed individuals.\nFormula: \\[AR = I_{e} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if there were 6 deaths per 100 among smokers, and 1 death per 100 in non-smokers, the attributable risk would be 5 per 100. This assumes that causes other than the one under investigation have had equal effects on the exposed and unexposed groups.\n\n\n\nOdds Ratio\n\nDefinition: The odds ratio is a relative measure of risk that quantifies the likelihood of exposed individuals developing a disease compared to the likelihood of unexposed individuals developing the same disease. The odds ratio is a way to compare whether the probability of an event occurring is the same for two groups.\nFormula: \\[OR = \\frac{Odds_{e}}{Odds_{unex}}\\]\nInterpretation:\n\nIf the value is equal to 1, the probability of the event occurring is the same for both groups.\nA value greater than 1 indicates that the event is more likely to occur in the first group,\na value less than 1 indicates that the event is more likely to occur in the second group.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Difference (Attributable Risk)\n\nDefinition: The attributable risk, or risk difference, is the difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups, i.e., it assesses the excess morbidity in the exposed group due to the impact of the studied risk factor. The attributable risk quantifies the risk in the exposed group that is attributable to the exposure. It represents the portion of morbidity that could be reduced or eliminated by removing the exposure.\nFormula: \\[RD = AR = I_{e} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if the risk difference is 0.05, it means that 5 out of 100 individuals developed the disease as a result of the exposure.\nNumber Needed to Harm (NNH): This is the number of exposed individuals needed to develop one additional case of the disease. \\[NNH = \\frac{1}{RD}\\]\n\n\n\nEtiologic Fraction (EF) also attributable fraction in the exposed\n\nDefinition: The attributable fraction in the exposed represents the relative proportion of diseased individuals in the exposed group who developed the disease as a result of the impact of the studied risk factor.\nFormula:\n\n\\[EF = \\frac{I_{e} - I_{unex}}{I_{e}}\\]\n\n\nAlternatively, if incidence data are not available, the relative risk (RR) can be used to calculate the EF \\[EF = \\frac{RR - 1}{RR}\\]\n\nInterpretation: For example, if the attributable fraction in the exposed is 10%, it means that one-tenth of all diseased individuals in the exposed group developed the disease as a result of the impact of the studied risk factor.\n\n\n\nPopulation Attributable Risk (PAR)\n\nDefinition: The population attributable risk assesses the proportion of all cases of the disease in the entire population (both exposed and unexposed) that are attributable to the exposure or the action of the risk factor. It evaluates the excess morbidity in the entire population attributable to the risk factor.\nFormula: \\[PAR = I_{population} - I_{unex}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, a study in the USA in 1986 showed that the incidence of lung cancer among non-smokers was 8.7/100,000 per year, while in the entire population, it was 72.5/100,000 per year. The PAR of 63.8/100,000 per year is a result of smoking.\n\n\n\nPopulation Etiologic Fraction (PEF)\n\nDefinition: The population etiologic fraction represents the relative proportion of morbidity in the entire population (both exposed and unexposed) that is a result of the action of the exposure.\nFormula: \\[PEF = \\frac{I_{population} - I_{unex}}{I_{population}}\\]\nInterpretation: For example, if the population etiologic fraction is 88%, it means that 88 out of 100 cases of the disease in the entire population are a result of the action of the studied risk factor.\n\n\n\n\nRisk assessment indicators"

Проведено е проучване с цел да установим дали нов медикамент - бета блокер е ефективен за намаляване на сърдечната честотата 16. Изследователката компанията е извършила първоначален експеримент с 80 случайно избрани пациенти - 40 са получили новия медикамент, а останалите 40 плацебо таблетка. След 4 месеца са измерени стойностите на сърдечната честота на всеки един участник. Данните са представени в Таблица 4 и в Таблица 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nЕкспериментална група\n\n\n\n\n58, 58, 58, 59, 60, 60, 60, 60, 61, 61, 62, 62, 63, 64, 64, 64, 64, 65, 65, 65, 65, 66, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 71, 71, 71, 72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 4: Стойности на сърдечна честота на пациентите в експерименталната група\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nКонтролна група\n\n\n\n\n68, 68, 70, 71, 71, 72, 72, 74, 74, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 78, 79, 80, 80, 81, 82, 82, 82, 83, 84, 84, 85, 85, 86, 88, 89, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 93, 93, 94, 94, 96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 5: Стойности на сърдечна честота на пациентите в контролната група група\n\n\n\n\n\nДефиниране на нулева хипотеза \\({H_0}\\) и алтернативна хипотеза \\({H_1}\\)\n\nНулева хипотеза\n\nНяма разлика между средната сърдечна честота в двете групи пациенти.

Пациентите лекувани с бета блокер се характеризират с среден пулс от 65 уд/мин и стандартно отклонение от 4,08 уд/мин, докато при пациентите приемащи плацебо средният пулс е близо 82 уд/мин, а стандартното отклонение 8.16 уд/мин. Наблюдаваната разликата между средните величини в двете групи е почти 17 уд/мин.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nФигура 1: В групата с бета блокер (тъмно сиво) средният пулс е 65 уд/мин (непрекъсната линия), докато в контролната група (светлосиво) пулсът е 81 уд/мин (прекъсната линия). Добиваме и представа и за хомогеността. Пулсът на пациентите с бета блокер варира малко, а стойностите са близко около средната аритметична, докато в плацебо групата вариацията е по-голяма - разпределението по-широко.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nхарактертистика\nБета блокер\nПлацебо\n\n\n\n\nСредна аритметична\n65.00\n81.83\n\n\nSD\n4.08\n8.16\n\n\nМедиана\n65.00\n82.00\n\n\nIQR\n6.25\n14.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nТаблица 6: Описателна статистики на променливата сърдечен пулс в двете групи\n\n\n\n\n\n\nИзчисляване на t-статистиката\nЗа да достигнем до извод колко е вероятно тази разликата в пулса да е случайна, трябва да изчислим стойността \\(t\\) като използваме формула\n\\[ t = \\frac{|{\\bar{x}_1}-{\\bar{x}_2}|}{\\sqrt{{{SE_{m_1}}^2} + {SE_{m_2}}^2}} \\]\nКъдето:\n\n\\({\\bar{x}_1}\\) е средната аритметична на пулса в групата с бета блокер;\n\\({\\bar{x}_2}\\) е средната аритметична на пулса в контролната група;\n\\({SE_{m{_1}}}\\) е стандартната грешка на средната аритметична в групата с бета блокер;\n\\({SE_{m{_2}}}\\) е стандартната грешка на средната аритметична в контролната група;\n\\({|{\\bar{x}_1}-{\\bar{x}_2}|}\\) е абсолютната стойност на разликата между средните аритметични;\n\\({\\sqrt{{{SE_{m_1}}^2} + {SE_{m_2}}^2}}\\) е корен квадратен от сумата на квадратите на стандартните грешки на средните аритметични;\n\\({t}\\) е стойността на t-статистиката.\n\n\nИзчисляване на стандартните грешки\nЗа да изчислим стандартната грешка за всяка от групите прилагаме вече позната формула от упражнение 2\nЗа групата с бета блокер: \\[ {SE_{m{_1}}}=\\frac{SD_1}{\\sqrt{n_1}} \\]\n\\[ {SE_{m{_1}}} =\\frac{4.08}{\\sqrt{40}}=\\frac{4.08}{6.33}= 0.65\\]\nЗа групата с плацебо 20 \\[ {SE_{m{_2}}}=\\frac{SD_2}{\\sqrt{n_2}} \\]\n\\[ {SE_{m{_2}}} =\\frac{8.16}{\\sqrt{40}}=\\frac{8.16}{6.33}= 1.29\\]\n\n\nПриложение на формулата за t-стойността\nСлед като сме изчислили стандартните грешки на средните аритметични за двете групи заместваме във формулата:\n\\[ t = \\frac{|{\\bar{x}_1}-{\\bar{x}_2}|}{\\sqrt{{{SE_{m_1}}^2} + {SE_{m_2}}^2}} \\]\n\\[ {t} = \\frac{|65.00-81.83|}{\\sqrt{{0.65^2} + {1.29}^2}} \\]\n\\[ {t} = \\frac{|-16.83|}{\\sqrt{0.43 + 1.66}} = \\frac{16.83}{\\sqrt{2.09}} = \\frac{16.83}{1.45}=11.6 \\]\n\n\n\nИзчисляване на p стойността\nЗа да определим вероятността разликата в двете групи да бъде случайна - \\(p\\) използваме изчислената \\(t\\) стойност. Не са необходими допълнителни формули, понеже не е необходима точната числена стойност на \\(p\\). В тази стъпка само определяме отношението на вероятността \\(p\\) спрямо зададеното нивото на значимост (риск от грешка 1-ви род) \\({\\alpha}\\). За целта използваме Таблица 7\n\n\n\nТаблица 7: t-разпределение\n\n\n\n\n\ndf\np = 0.1\np= 0.05\np = 0.01\n\n\n\n\n30\nt= 1.645\nt = 1.960\nt = 2.576\n\n\n\n\n\n\nВ таблицата:\n\n\\({df}\\) е степента на свобода. Тя зависи от броя единици на наблюдения. Познаването на този индикатор не е необходимо за настоящият анализ - по правило се използват само стойностите отговарящи на \\({df}&gt;30\\);\nВсяка една колона представя гранично ниво на риска за грешка от първи род \\({\\alpha}\\). В медицината използваме лимитираща стойност от \\({\\alpha}&lt;0.05\\), затова се интересуваме от стойностите във втората колона;\nПо редове са представени стойностите на \\(t\\) критерия, отговорящи на съответните нива на значимост;\nАко получим \\({t} = 1.645\\) вероятността за случайност е 10% (0.1). При \\({t} = 1.96\\) вероятността за случайност е 5% (0.1), а при \\({t} = 2.576\\) вероятността за случайност е 1% (0.01).\n\nВ нашия пример стойността \\({t} = 11.6\\). Въпреки, че тя липсва в Таблица 7 можем да заключим, че вероятността за случайност е под 1% (0.01).\n\n\nСтатистически извод\nСега е момента да направим финалното заключение за нашето проучване.\n\nРазликата между двете групи e 16.83, а t критерия е 11.6.\nВ таблицата установения t критерии е по-голям от 2.576, следователно и вероятността да наблюдаваме подобна разлика в двете групи е по-малка от от 0.01.\nОпределената вероятност е под риска за грешка - p &lt; \\({\\alpha}\\) &lt;0.05, което означава че отхвърляме \\({H_0}\\) и приемаме \\({H_1}\\) - групата лекувана с бета блокер има значително по-ниски стойности на сърдечния пулс спрямо пациентите лекувани с плацебо.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nВажно\n\n\n\n\n\nКолкото е по-висока стойността на \\({t}\\) критерия, толкова по-малко вероятно е да бъде наблюдаваме случайно. При стойност на \\({t}\\) над 1,96, вероятността за случайност \\(p &lt; 0.05\\), което ни позволява да отхвърлям нулевата хипотеза\n\n\n\n\n\nВажни зависимости\nПри равни други условия:\n\nПо-голямата абсолютната разлика в средните аритметични води до по-голяма стойност на t критерия и до по-малка вероятност за случайност;\nПо-високата хомогенност в групите води до по-малко стандартно отклонение, което е причина за по-малка стандартна грешка и по-високи стойности на t критерия;\nУвеличаването на броя наблюдения в извадката води до по-малко стандартно отклонение и по-малка стандартната грешка, тоест до по-високи стойности на t критерия."

While email communication has been around for over 20 years, newer forms of engaging, such as texting, video conferencing, social media, and patient portals are increasingly prevalent. All these raise concerns about physicians’ statutory obligations to protect privacy\nRules for electronic communication with patients:\n\nSet up a professional email address (e.g., DoctorX@organization.com) separate from your personal email account;\nClarify who will have access to this account;\nClarify what types of information will be sent by email and what will not be;\nEstablish expectations for response times;\nObtain written consent for such communication;\nAdvise patients of risks to privacy, regardless of the security of the system;\nUse a private computer for communication, not one shared with others;\nEstablish how email communication will be integrated into the patient record;\nRemember that electronic communications are permanent;\nNever write anything in an email that you could not support if it was known to the patient or publicly disclosed;\nDo not write or respond to emails when tired or upset;\nEstablish whether it is reasonable to be compensated for providing care to patients in this way."

    "text": "When can confidentiality be overridden?\nIf confidentiality is to be breached, there must be a good reason for doing so. The most common justifications are as follows:\n\nThe patient consents explicitly. The patient might well, for example, consent to their doctor informing a relative of their diagnosis.\nThe patient consents implicitly. For example, if a patient agrees to be referred to a consultant, they will be taken to have implicitly consented to the GP passing on medical information to the consultant. This exception can also apply to local clinical audits and similar standard hospital practice.\nIf the patient lacks mental capacity, then confidentiality can be breached if it is in their best interests to do so.\nThe disclosure is required by law. For example, doctors must register births and deaths: the patient has no right of opt-​out. Likewise, patients who receive fertility treatment or abortions also must be registered. Doctors are also required by law to inform the Health Protection Agency if their patients are suspected to be suffering from any of the conditions included in the list of ‘notifiable disease’. These include cholera, legionnaires’ disease, rabies, and whooping cough 1.\nThe disclosure can be justified in the public interest. This might be used where a patient poses a risk to others and disclosure is needed to protect other people from harm.\nPolice who are investigating a crime may obtain a judge’s permission to access medical notes. In such cases, the doctor is legally obliged to provide the information requested. Doctors are also required to disclose information that may prevent an act of terrorism, or that may help police in identifying the perpetrator of a driving offence.\n\nIn almost all jurisdictions, medical practitioners are required to breach confidentiality and report any information about the possible mistreatment or neglect of children. Again, the threshold for reporting is having an opinion, based on “reasonable suspicion or belief,” that abuse is taking place. Failure to report reasonable suspicions may be punishable by fine\nSometimes a physician may be asked by an employer to report on a patient’s fitness to return to work. The specific medical conditions of the patient do not have to be identified and ought not to be without the patient’s consent. More complicated situations arise where a physician acts as a “third party” examiner, such as for an insurance company requesting an independent medical examination of one of their clients. Even if the examination is done for third-party purposes, any suspicious or unanticipated findings with consequences for the patient’s welfare must be disclosed first to the patient and, only with their consent, to their own family doctor."

    "text": "Balancing benefits and harms\nA decision to disclose is often not based on the interests of the person concerned but is made to protect other people or the public at large. The decision to disclose is based partly on a balancing of several moral imperatives, including the risk and likelihood of harm if no disclosure is made, and the need to maintain the trust of the patient and the harms that may result from breach of confidence.\nHealth professionals can be in an invidious position in having to weigh speculative as well as known facts, and assess whether a perceived harm can be better averted by making a disclosure or by maintaining the trust of an individual while attempting to persuade him or her to disclose voluntarily.\nIn some cases, although a duty of confidentiality is owed, the need to protect other people may tip the balance. This may be the case, for example, when domestic violence occurs in a family where children are at risk. In many cases, however, clear and unambiguous information upon which to judge the potential threat is unavailable. Non-consensual disclosure is generally considered justifiable in cases where the threat appears serious, and disclosure is likely to limit or prevent it occurring."

    "text": "Are relatives entitled to information from the deceased’s medical record?\nFamily members have no legal right of access to the health records of the deceased patient. In practice, however,doctors have always had discretion to disclose information to a deceased person’s relatives or others for appropriate purposes when there is a clear justification. A common example is when the family requests details of the terminal illness because of an anxiety that the patient might have been misdiagnosed or there might have been negligence. Disclosure in such cases is likely to be what the deceased wanted and may also be in the interests of justice. Refusal to disclose in the absence of some evidence that this was the deceased patient’s known wish exacerbates suspicion and can result in unnecessary litigation. In other cases, the balance of benefit to be gained by disclosure to the family, for example of a hereditary or infectious condition, may outweigh the general obligation of confidentiality to the deceased. Information should not be disclosed if the patient gave it in the past with the specific understanding or expectation that it would be kept confidential. No information at all can be revealed if the patient requested non-disclosure except where there is a public interest justification."

Kaylee’s history and exam are very typical for appendicitis. She reports her menstrual periods are regular, and she adamantly denies being sexually active. In the operating room at midnight, the appendix is found to be normal, but there is bleeding mass in her right fallopian tube, almost certainly an ectopic pregnancy. A gynecologist is called in and carries out a right salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube). After the procedure, Dr S. goes out to talk with Kaylee’s mother in the waiting room.\n\nWhat should Dr S tell Kaylee’s mother?\n\n\nCase 6\nYou are a family physician working in an inner-city drug rehabilitation clinic one day a week.

She has been attending a specialist clinic on a yearly basis for monitoring. Sometimes Paula attends with her parents, although patients are encouraged to increasingly take an independent approach. At the latest appointment Paula specifically asked to speak to the consultant without her dad being present. She asked the consultant of the risks of developing a metabolic crisis associated with illicit drug use. She admitted that she occasionally uses recreational drugs. She insisted that her parents should not be informed of this and from previous conversations with her parents it is clear that they do not know of the drug use. The team has advised Paula about the implications and risks of her behaviour in terms of her health and the fact that it is illegal, but the consultant wonders whether he should inform Paula’s parents of her drug use.\n\n\nCase 12\nOne of your patients has recently died from ovarian cancer. She had presented to the surgery twice with vague symptoms prior to being referred for an ultrasound scan which demonstrated advanced cancer.

He has been treated by his GP for depression for the last 7 years. More recently he has developed abnormal facial movements and spasms in his legs which are occurring at rest. The GP suspected that his low mood and lethargy over the past 7 years may be due to Huntington’s disease, which is now only becoming apparent with the onset of new clinical features. Doug was referred to a specialist for genetic testing, and sadly the result has come back positive and he has now been given a definite diagnosis of Huntington’s disease. Doug was adopted at birth and has no knowledge of his biological parents. He feels relieved that he was unaware that one of his parents would also have had the condition as he would not have wanted to find out his diagnosis before becoming symptomatic. Doug has told his wife, and together they have decided that they do not want any of their children to know about his diagnosis. They have been informed by the counsellor at the genetics clinic that their children might want to know because they each have a 50% chance of having the gene mutation. Although Doug and his wife have been offered support to share the difficult news with their children, they strongly resist telling them as they feel the knowledge would be a burden to them – ‘and what can they do about it anyway?’\n\nShould genetic information belong to individuals or families?\nDo Doug and his wife have an ethical obligation to tell their children they are at risk of a genetic condition?\nAre there any circumstances in which genetic information can be disclosed without their consent?\n\n\n\nCase 14\nPearl and Dean have been married for 12 years and have a 6-year-old son. Dean’s father and grandfather died from cancer when they were in their early 40s. Because of the strong family history of cancer, Dean wanted to have a genetic test to find out his level of risk. Although no clear diagnosis was possible, tests indicated that he was at risk of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Now Dean is feeling tired and unwell, and has a colonoscopy. The test reveals that he has inoperable bowel cancer. Pearl is concerned that their son might also be at risk of colon cancer when he is older, and she wants him to be tested to see if he is at risk.\nQuestions\n\nShould parents be allowed to have their children tested for adult-onset genetic conditions?\nDo children have a right to know about their genetic risks?"

    "text": "Doctors owe special duties of care to their patients;\nAll interactions involving doctors and patients should be characterised by honesty, politeness and respect on both sides;\nEffective communication requires both parties to listen, talk frankly and recognize uncertainties;\nDoctors have the main duty to make the relationship work but patients also have responsibilities;\nEstablishing and maintaining appropriate boundaries is essential.\n\n\n\nDiscussion of the ‘doctor–patient partnership’ has the therapeutic model in mind, whether it takes place in a primary care or hospital setting. The doctor has a commitment to the patient although other professionals may manage specific episodes of care. What distinguishes this from other models of care is that the doctor focuses on the best interests of the patient, even though the patient’s wishes may have to be overridden in exceptional cases if they conflict seriously with other duties of the doctor, such as the need to use evidence-based therapies, manage hospital resources carefully or avoid putting other people’s health at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physician-patient relationship has long been regarded as asymmetric. The physician was supposed to have knowledge about the patient’s condition, whereas the patient was seen as someone who lacked insight in his own situation. The physician was considered to be rational, the patient emotional. In the last decades the situation changed fundamentally. Patient autonomy and right to take decision is now emphasized. Physicians are less inclined to think they know what is best for the patient.\nThomas Percival’s 1803 influential text on medical ethics set the benchmark for the traits of a good doctor which, he said, should be a balance of compassion and authority. He advised that doctors should be sensitive to patients’ fears and anxieties by shielding them from disturbing information. Generations of doctors were taught to keep up patients’ hopes and spirits by withholding bad news which would depress them. The duty of beneficence was interpreted as an obligation to be reassuring rather than honest. From the 1950s, this interpretation became discredited and, by the 1980s, paternalism was seen as completely outmoded. All current ethical guidance sees patients themselves as the most suitable arbiters of their own best interests. This entails them being given all the relevant information about their condition.\nChanging expectations of the doctors’ role led some to be concerned that they would be seen as mere technicians rather than real partners in relationships with patients. Terms such as ‘cafeteria medicine’ describe situations in which doctors are perceived as simply offering patients a menu of choices in a mechanistic approach to patient autonomy. Although there must be a presumption that patients are informed about decisions in relation to their treatment, the fear of being seen as paternalistic or disrespectful of patient autonomy should no mean that doctors automatically apply the same checklist in all cases.\n\n\n\nModels of the Doctor–Patient Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of paternalism originated in the 1880s, with its fundamental idea being the “principle and practice of paternal administration, government by a father.” Drawing an analogy with a father, paternalism assumes two aspects of the paternal role: the father acting benevolently in line with his understanding of his children’s interests and making decisions about their well-being instead of letting them decide. In healthcare relationships, this analogy extends further, asserting that professionals, with their superior training and knowledge, hold an authoritative position to determine the patient’s best interests. Hence, the central principle in this model is beneficence.\nPaternalism always entails some form of interference or refusal to comply with an individual’s preferences regarding their well-being. Paternalistic actions often involve force, coercion, deception, lying, manipulation of information, or withholding information. Various forms of paternalism exist:\n\nStrong paternalism implies that the patient is competent to give consent, but the doctor does not afford them the opportunity, withholding sufficient information.\nWeak paternalism indicates that the patient is unable to comprehend the provided information due to factors like youth, mental illness, or incapacity.\n\nContemporary ethics generally rejects strong paternalism, except in rare instances like mandatory treatment for certain infectious diseases with quarantine measures or obligatory tests in specific professions. Antipaternalists argue that strong paternalistic intervention cannot be justified as it violates individual rights and excessively restricts free choice. On the other hand, weak paternalism finds justification in emergency situations or when the patient cannot make decisions due to pain, stress, unconsciousness, or shock. It is deemed acceptable for young children, very old patients, and mentally ill patients, especially in emergency situations where there’s no time for surrogate decision-making. In these cases, the prevention of harm or the provision of benefits usually outweighs the loss of independence, given the person’s limited ability to make autonomous choices.\nThere are also distinctions between active and passive paternalism.\n\nActive paternalism occurs when a patient prefers non-intervention\nPassive paternalism involves a professional’s refusal to carry out a patient’s positive preferences for paternalistic reasons.\n\nPassive paternalism is generally more justifiable than active paternalism, as physicians are not morally obligated to satisfy a patient’s desires if they conflict with accepted medical standards or the physician’s conscience.\n\n\n\nThe model is sometimes referred to as the scientific engineering or consumer model. In this approach, the goal of the interaction between the physician and patient is for the physician to furnish the patient with all pertinent information. The patient, in turn, selects the medical interventions they desire, which is carried out the by the doctor. In this context, the physician educates the patient about their disease state, potential diagnostic and therapeutic options, the risks and benefits associated with these interventions, and any uncertainties in knowledge.\nThe informative model presupposes a distinct separation between facts and values. The patient’s values are assumed to be well-defined and known; what the patient lacks is factual information. The physician’s duty is to provide all available facts, with the patient’s values determining the course of treatment. There is no room for the physician’s values, or judgment. In the informative model, the physician functions as a conveyor of technical expertise, offering the patient the means to exert control. The concept of patient autonomy in this model revolves around the patient’s control over medical decision-making.\nIn its most extremes form of this model, physicians are viewed as the services or commodities they provide—essentially, mere products. Consequently, the doctor-patient relationship in this model is highly asymmetrical, differing significantly from the partnership model and, in some aspects, can be seen as the complete opposite of the paternalist model. Analee and Thomas Beisecker succinctly encapsulate the consumer metaphor in the doctor-patient relationship with the following points: “Consumerism focuses on rights; consumerism assumes the doctor is self-centered; consumerism replaces trust with accountability; consumerism presumes that the patient’s health care values dominate; consumerism may require third-party supervision.” The underlying assumption of the consumer model is that the interests of the physician and the patient diverge, and the sole person genuinely concerned about the patient’s health is the patient. Crucially, in this context, the specific distribution of power lies in the hands of the patient: “In a consumerist relationship, the seller has no particular authority; power rests in the buyer who can make the decisions to buy or not to buy as he or she sees fit.”\n\n\n\nThis model closely follows the informative model but provides a greater role for the doctor to assist the patient in understanding her values and interests, and the possible impact of different interventions in these terms. The doctor acts as an advisor to help the patient “elucidate and make coherent” their values but does not pass judgement on these values or attempt to prioritize them on behalf of the patient. The ultimate choice of intervention still rests with the patient in the interpretive model, but the doctor plays a more active role in shaping this choice. Similar to the informative physician, the interpretive physician imparts information about the nature of the condition and the potential risks and benefits of interventions. However, the interpretive physician goes beyond this by helping the patient articulate and comprehend their values, aiding in determining which medical interventions best reflect those values.\nIn the interpretive model, the patient’s values are not necessarily fixed and may not be fully understood by the patient. They might be unclear, in flux, or conflicting in specific situations. In extreme cases, the physician may view the patient’s life as a narrative whole, specifying the patient’s values and their priority, and then identifying tests and treatments that align with these values. Importantly, the physician does not dictate to the patient.\n\n\n\nIn the deliberative model, the goal of the physician-patient interaction is to assist the patient in determining and selecting the most appropriate health-related values that can be actualized in the clinical context. The physician accomplishes this by providing information about the patient’s clinical situation and helping to clarify the types of values inherent in the available options. The physician’s objectives extend to suggesting why certain health-related values are more commendable and should be pursued.\nThis model closely follows the interpretive model but gives the doctor a greater role in judging and prioritizing patient values.** It is the doctor’s role to “elucidate the types of values embodied in the available options, suggesting why certain health-related values are more worthy and should be aspired to.”. The aim of the deliberation is moral persuasion, but not coercion, with the patient ultimately deciding on the appropriate validity and priority of these values in their life. Whereas the doctor is an advisor or counsellor in the interpretive model, in the deliberative model they serve as “a teacher or friend, engaging the patient in dialogue on what course of action would be best.” The doctor indicates both what the patient could do and, in the context of their understanding of the patient’s life and values, what he thinks the patient should do in terms of choice of intervention. The final decision still remains with the patient but is subject to greater persuasion and normative argumentation on the part of the doctor. This model conceives of patient autonomy as a tool for moral self-development; “the patient is empowered not simply to follow unexamined preferences or examined values, but to consider, through dialogue, alternative health-related values, their worthiness, and their implications for treatment.”\n\n\n\n\nIt is never easy to deliver or receive bad news, particularly when no cure is available and there is little that the patient or health team can do to alter the situation. The doctor’s role is to ensure that decision making is returned as much as possible to the patient, rather than pre-empting the choice. Although in the past, doctors often fudged the issue because they feared that the truth might result in lost hopes, sadness, suffering and grief, patients now expect honest answers and support for the anxieties that may flow from them. They should be supported in dealing with the additional anxiety sometimes created by greater knowledge. They have their own goals and need as accurate information as possible about what is achievable. The clinical limitations need to be discussed but doctors also need to be open about any other factors that are likely to affect treatment decisions or their timing.\n\n\n\n\nOne defines bad news as “any news that drastically and negatively alters the patient’s view of her or his future”. Bad news is stereotypically associated with a terminal diagnosis, but family physicians encounter many situations that involve imparting bad news; for example, a pregnant woman’s ultrasound verifies a fetal demise, a middle-aged woman’s magnetic resonance imaging scan confirms the clinical suspicion of multiple sclerosis, or an adolescent’s polydipsia and weight loss prove to be the onset of diabetes.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why physicians have difficulty breaking bad news. A common concern is how the news will affect the patient, and this is often used to justify withholding bad news. Hippocrates advised “concealing most things from the patient while you are attending to him. Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and serenity…revealing nothing of the patient’s future or present condition. For many patients…have taken a turn for the worse…by forecast of what is to come.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Advance preparation\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the relevant clinical information. Ideally, have the patient’s chart or pertinent laboratory data on hand during the conversation.\nBe prepared to provide at least basic information about prognosis and treatment options.\nArrange for adequate time in a private, comfortable location. Instruct office or hospital staff that there should be no interruptions. Turn your pager to silent mode or leave it with a colleague.\nMentally rehearse how you will deliver the news. You may wish to practice out loud, as you would prepare for public speaking. Script specific words and phrases to use or avoid.\nIf you have limited experience delivering bad news, consider observing a more experienced colleague or role play a variety of scenarios with colleagues before actually being faced with the situation. Prepare emotionally.\n\n\nB Build a therapeutic environment/relationship\n\n\nDetermine the patient’s preferences for what and how much they want to know.\nWhen possible, have family members or other supportive persons present. This should be at the patient’s discretion. If bad news is anticipated, ask in advance who they would like present and how they would like the others to be involved.\nIntroduce yourself to everyone present and ask for names and relationships to the patient. Foreshadow the bad news, “I’m sorry, but I have bad news.”\nUse touch where appropriate. Some patients or family members will prefer not to be touched. Be sensitive to cultural differences and personal preference.\nAvoid inappropriate humor or flippant comments; depending on your relationship with the patient, some discreet humor may be appropriate. Assure the patient you will be available.\nSchedule follow-up meetings and make appropriate arrangements with your office. Advise appropriate staff and colleagues of the situation.\n\n\nC Communicate well\n\n\nAsk what the patient or family already knows and understands. One source advises, “Before you tell, ask…. Find out the patient’s expectations before you give the information.” Speak frankly but compassionately.\nAvoid euphemisms and medical jargon. Use the words cancer or death.\nAllow silence and tears, and avoid the urge to talk to overcome your own discomfort. Proceed at the patient’s pace. Have the patient tell you his or her understanding of what you have said. Encourage questions.\nAt subsequent visits, ask the patient if he or she understands, and use repetition and corrections as needed. Be aware that the patient will not retain much of what is said after the initial bad news.\nWrite things down, use sketches or diagrams, and repeat key information. At the conclusion of each visit, summarize and make follow-up plans.\n\n\nD Deal with the patient and family reactions\n\n\nAssess and respond to emotional reactions.\nBe aware of cognitive coping strategies (e.g., denial, blame, intellectualization, disbelief, acceptance).\nBe attuned to body language.\nWith subsequent visits, monitor the patient’s emotional status, assessing for despondency or suicidal ideations.\nBe empathetic; it is appropriate to say “I’m sorry” or “I don’t know.” Crying may be appropriate, but be reflective—are your tears from empathy with your patient or are they a reflection of your own personal issues?\nDo not argue with or criticize colleagues; avoid defensiveness regarding your, or a colleague’s, medical care.\n\n\nE Encourage and validate emotions\n\n\nOffer realistic hope. Even if a cure is not realistic, offer hope and encouragement about what options are available. Discuss treatment options at the outset, and arrange follow-up meetings for decision making.\nExplore what the news means to the patient. Inquire about the patient’s emotional and spiritual needs and what support systems they have in place.\nOffer referrals as needed. Use interdisciplinary services to enhance patient care (e.g., hospice), but avoid using these as a means of disengaging from the relationship.\nAttend to your own needs during and following the delivery of bad news. Issues of counter-transference may arise, triggering poorly understood but powerful feelings. A formal or informal debriefing session with involved house staff, office or hospital personnel may be appropriate to review the medical management and their feelings.\n\n\n\n\nThe acronym SPIKES, stands for Setting up, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Emotions with Empathy, and Strategy or Summary. This approach was designed by Walter Baile and colleagues at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston TX, and is designed to help healthcare professionals to accomplish the following while breaking bad news:\n\nSetting Up\n\nThe first step of the SPIKES protocol is setting up the interview. Setting the stage for optimal communication by preparing what to say prior to the conversation is essential to successful communication. In this steps setting the room environment where the discussion will take place also is important.\n\nPerception\n\nThe patient’s perception of the news to be shared will determine how the news is conveyed to the patient. Empathic communication skills will help the doctor explore the patient and family’s perception of illness or events to date in a disease trajectory. The patient’s response to the doctor’s questioning will help guide the manner and detail by which the details will be conveyed. Additionally, the physician can interpret if the patient is engaging in any variation of illness denial such as wishful thinking, omission of the essential but unfavorable medical details of the illness, or unrealistic expectations of treatment.\n\nInvitation\n\nThe permission to have information shared is granted by the patient or family. Once an inquiry has been made as to the extent of understanding and the context in which the information fits, the doctor can then ask for permission to share the current news. Using what the patient has shared about their understanding of the illness and the context in which testing has been done, the doctor then asks permission to share the current information.\n\nKnowledge\n\nTo “Fire a Warning Shot” and warn the patient and family that the incoming news is not good. Beginning a discussion with phrases such as: “Unfortunately I have some bad news to tell you,” or “I am sorry to tell you,” or “Things are not going in the direction we had hoped” allows the patient and family to emotionally brace themselves for the information to follow. These statements of warning also establish the doctor as a patient advocate.\nThe sharing of bad news must be presented based on the assessed level of patient’s understanding, compliance, and wishes for disclosure. Instead of using technical language, showing patients concrete examples of trends in lab work or radiology can make an abstract concept clearer. The actual sharing of the bad news should be done slowly so that the patient and family understand. Choosing words carefully is particularly important if the news indicates a very poor prognosis. In situations involving cancer, patients report that the most important component of the process of breaking bad news is the content itself, specifically the expertise and the specific detail that is provided during the conversation. This demands that the doctor be well prepared for the informational needs of the patient and family.\n\nEmpathy\n\nPatients will have a wide range of emotional reactions as they respond to the bad news delivered to them. The emotional response may range from silence to dramatic crying and sobbing. This creates a potentially awkward situation for the doctor, but this sense of awkwardness can be diminished through engaging in empathetic communication. Although the entire conversation and time spent interacting with the patient involves empathetic communication, an appropriate and kind response to the emotion demonstrated when the patient hears bad news is critically important. The doctor should show an understanding of the patient’s emotion and demonstrate empathy and respect in the face of a difficult situation.\n\nStrategizing for the future\n\nThe last step in the SPIKES Protocol, will be to establish that patients have a clear plan for the future. Preparatory information is important in order to decrease distress, regardless of illness stage. One of the best ways to prepare a patient for participation in treatment decisions is to ensure that he or she understands the information that has been provided. Before discussing a treatment plan, it is important to ask your patient if they are ready for such a discussion. Frequent clarification during the discussion of the treatment plan will help the doctor establish the patient’s understanding and likelihood of following through with the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall gifts from patients of nominal or modest value are acceptable on the part of the physician. This is provided that there is no expectation of a different form of therapy or a higher level of care based on the gift. You can accept a cake at Christmas, a balloon on your birthday, or other tokens of esteem, but not if the patient expects an extra, or different prescription for something, in exchange for the gift. The rules on gifts from patients are far less rigorous, precise, or clear than the rules on gifts from the pharmaceutical industry. There is an automatic presumption that gifts from industry always carry an influence toward a product, service, or prescribing practice. Gifts from industry are viewed differently because there can be no other intention behind them except to buy influence and alter behavior. There is no such automatic presumption on the part of gifts received from patients.\n\n\n\nSexual contact between a physician and a patient is always inappropriate. It is unclear if there can ever be a completely acceptable, ethical way to alter the physician/patient relationship so that sexual contact is acceptable. At the very least, the physician and patient must mutually agree to end the formal professional relationship of a doctor and a patient. It is not clear how much time must elapse between the ending of the professional doctor/ patient relationship and the beginning of a personal relationship. The recommendation for psychiatrists is somewhat unique. The American Psychiatric Association guidelines specifically state that there can never be a sexual or personally intimate private relationship between doctor and patient even after the professional relationship has ended. In other words, a psychiatrist should not have sexual contact even with former patients. These guidelines apply no matter who initiates the relationship. In other words, it is not more acceptable for a doctor and patient to have sexual relations if the patient initiates the sexual relationship rather than the physician. These guidelines also take no account of gender or sexual orientation. It is always ethically unacceptable to have a sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and either a current or a former patient. It is ethically unacceptable for a physician of any kind to have a sexual relationship with a current patient."

What distinguishes this from other models of care is that the doctor focuses on the best interests of the patient, even though the patient’s wishes may have to be overridden in exceptional cases if they conflict seriously with other duties of the doctor, such as the need to use evidence-based therapies, manage hospital resources carefully or avoid putting other people’s health at risk."

    "text": "The physician-patient relationship has long been regarded as asymmetric. The physician was supposed to have knowledge about the patient’s condition, whereas the patient was seen as someone who lacked insight in his own situation. The physician was considered to be rational, the patient emotional. In the last decades the situation changed fundamentally. Patient autonomy and right to take decision is now emphasized. Physicians are less inclined to think they know what is best for the patient.\nThomas Percival’s 1803 influential text on medical ethics set the benchmark for the traits of a good doctor which, he said, should be a balance of compassion and authority. He advised that doctors should be sensitive to patients’ fears and anxieties by shielding them from disturbing information. Generations of doctors were taught to keep up patients’ hopes and spirits by withholding bad news which would depress them. The duty of beneficence was interpreted as an obligation to be reassuring rather than honest. From the 1950s, this interpretation became discredited and, by the 1980s, paternalism was seen as completely outmoded. All current ethical guidance sees patients themselves as the most suitable arbiters of their own best interests. This entails them being given all the relevant information about their condition.\nChanging expectations of the doctors’ role led some to be concerned that they would be seen as mere technicians rather than real partners in relationships with patients. Terms such as ‘cafeteria medicine’ describe situations in which doctors are perceived as simply offering patients a menu of choices in a mechanistic approach to patient autonomy. Although there must be a presumption that patients are informed about decisions in relation to their treatment, the fear of being seen as paternalistic or disrespectful of patient autonomy should no mean that doctors automatically apply the same checklist in all cases.\n\n\n\nModels of the Doctor–Patient Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of paternalism originated in the 1880s, with its fundamental idea being the “principle and practice of paternal administration, government by a father.” Drawing an analogy with a father, paternalism assumes two aspects of the paternal role: the father acting benevolently in line with his understanding of his children’s interests and making decisions about their well-being instead of letting them decide. In healthcare relationships, this analogy extends further, asserting that professionals, with their superior training and knowledge, hold an authoritative position to determine the patient’s best interests. Hence, the central principle in this model is beneficence.\nPaternalism always entails some form of interference or refusal to comply with an individual’s preferences regarding their well-being. Paternalistic actions often involve force, coercion, deception, lying, manipulation of information, or withholding information. Various forms of paternalism exist:\n\nStrong paternalism implies that the patient is competent to give consent, but the doctor does not afford them the opportunity, withholding sufficient information.\nWeak paternalism indicates that the patient is unable to comprehend the provided information due to factors like youth, mental illness, or incapacity.\n\nContemporary ethics generally rejects strong paternalism, except in rare instances like mandatory treatment for certain infectious diseases with quarantine measures or obligatory tests in specific professions. Antipaternalists argue that strong paternalistic intervention cannot be justified as it violates individual rights and excessively restricts free choice. On the other hand, weak paternalism finds justification in emergency situations or when the patient cannot make decisions due to pain, stress, unconsciousness, or shock. It is deemed acceptable for young children, very old patients, and mentally ill patients, especially in emergency situations where there’s no time for surrogate decision-making. In these cases, the prevention of harm or the provision of benefits usually outweighs the loss of independence, given the person’s limited ability to make autonomous choices.\nThere are also distinctions between active and passive paternalism.\n\nActive paternalism occurs when a patient prefers non-intervention\nPassive paternalism involves a professional’s refusal to carry out a patient’s positive preferences for paternalistic reasons.\n\nPassive paternalism is generally more justifiable than active paternalism, as physicians are not morally obligated to satisfy a patient’s desires if they conflict with accepted medical standards or the physician’s conscience.\n\n\n\nThe model is sometimes referred to as the scientific engineering or consumer model. In this approach, the goal of the interaction between the physician and patient is for the physician to furnish the patient with all pertinent information. The patient, in turn, selects the medical interventions they desire, which is carried out the by the doctor. In this context, the physician educates the patient about their disease state, potential diagnostic and therapeutic options, the risks and benefits associated with these interventions, and any uncertainties in knowledge.\nThe informative model presupposes a distinct separation between facts and values. The patient’s values are assumed to be well-defined and known; what the patient lacks is factual information. The physician’s duty is to provide all available facts, with the patient’s values determining the course of treatment. There is no room for the physician’s values, or judgment. In the informative model, the physician functions as a conveyor of technical expertise, offering the patient the means to exert control. The concept of patient autonomy in this model revolves around the patient’s control over medical decision-making.\nIn its most extremes form of this model, physicians are viewed as the services or commodities they provide—essentially, mere products. Consequently, the doctor-patient relationship in this model is highly asymmetrical, differing significantly from the partnership model and, in some aspects, can be seen as the complete opposite of the paternalist model. Analee and Thomas Beisecker succinctly encapsulate the consumer metaphor in the doctor-patient relationship with the following points: “Consumerism focuses on rights; consumerism assumes the doctor is self-centered; consumerism replaces trust with accountability; consumerism presumes that the patient’s health care values dominate; consumerism may require third-party supervision.” The underlying assumption of the consumer model is that the interests of the physician and the patient diverge, and the sole person genuinely concerned about the patient’s health is the patient. Crucially, in this context, the specific distribution of power lies in the hands of the patient: “In a consumerist relationship, the seller has no particular authority; power rests in the buyer who can make the decisions to buy or not to buy as he or she sees fit.”\n\n\n\nThis model closely follows the informative model but provides a greater role for the doctor to assist the patient in understanding her values and interests, and the possible impact of different interventions in these terms. The doctor acts as an advisor to help the patient “elucidate and make coherent” their values but does not pass judgement on these values or attempt to prioritize them on behalf of the patient. The ultimate choice of intervention still rests with the patient in the interpretive model, but the doctor plays a more active role in shaping this choice. Similar to the informative physician, the interpretive physician imparts information about the nature of the condition and the potential risks and benefits of interventions. However, the interpretive physician goes beyond this by helping the patient articulate and comprehend their values, aiding in determining which medical interventions best reflect those values.\nIn the interpretive model, the patient’s values are not necessarily fixed and may not be fully understood by the patient. They might be unclear, in flux, or conflicting in specific situations. In extreme cases, the physician may view the patient’s life as a narrative whole, specifying the patient’s values and their priority, and then identifying tests and treatments that align with these values. Importantly, the physician does not dictate to the patient.\n\n\n\nIn the deliberative model, the goal of the physician-patient interaction is to assist the patient in determining and selecting the most appropriate health-related values that can be actualized in the clinical context. The physician accomplishes this by providing information about the patient’s clinical situation and helping to clarify the types of values inherent in the available options. The physician’s objectives extend to suggesting why certain health-related values are more commendable and should be pursued.\nThis model closely follows the interpretive model but gives the doctor a greater role in judging and prioritizing patient values.** It is the doctor’s role to “elucidate the types of values embodied in the available options, suggesting why certain health-related values are more worthy and should be aspired to.”. The aim of the deliberation is moral persuasion, but not coercion, with the patient ultimately deciding on the appropriate validity and priority of these values in their life. Whereas the doctor is an advisor or counsellor in the interpretive model, in the deliberative model they serve as “a teacher or friend, engaging the patient in dialogue on what course of action would be best.” The doctor indicates both what the patient could do and, in the context of their understanding of the patient’s life and values, what he thinks the patient should do in terms of choice of intervention. The final decision still remains with the patient but is subject to greater persuasion and normative argumentation on the part of the doctor. This model conceives of patient autonomy as a tool for moral self-development; “the patient is empowered not simply to follow unexamined preferences or examined values, but to consider, through dialogue, alternative health-related values, their worthiness, and their implications for treatment.”"

    "text": "It is never easy to deliver or receive bad news, particularly when no cure is available and there is little that the patient or health team can do to alter the situation. The doctor’s role is to ensure that decision making is returned as much as possible to the patient, rather than pre-empting the choice. Although in the past, doctors often fudged the issue because they feared that the truth might result in lost hopes, sadness, suffering and grief, patients now expect honest answers and support for the anxieties that may flow from them. They should be supported in dealing with the additional anxiety sometimes created by greater knowledge. They have their own goals and need as accurate information as possible about what is achievable. The clinical limitations need to be discussed but doctors also need to be open about any other factors that are likely to affect treatment decisions or their timing.\n\n\n\n\nOne defines bad news as “any news that drastically and negatively alters the patient’s view of her or his future”. Bad news is stereotypically associated with a terminal diagnosis, but family physicians encounter many situations that involve imparting bad news; for example, a pregnant woman’s ultrasound verifies a fetal demise, a middle-aged woman’s magnetic resonance imaging scan confirms the clinical suspicion of multiple sclerosis, or an adolescent’s polydipsia and weight loss prove to be the onset of diabetes.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why physicians have difficulty breaking bad news. A common concern is how the news will affect the patient, and this is often used to justify withholding bad news. Hippocrates advised “concealing most things from the patient while you are attending to him. Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and serenity…revealing nothing of the patient’s future or present condition. For many patients…have taken a turn for the worse…by forecast of what is to come.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Advance preparation\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the relevant clinical information. Ideally, have the patient’s chart or pertinent laboratory data on hand during the conversation.\nBe prepared to provide at least basic information about prognosis and treatment options.\nArrange for adequate time in a private, comfortable location. Instruct office or hospital staff that there should be no interruptions. Turn your pager to silent mode or leave it with a colleague.\nMentally rehearse how you will deliver the news.

He has just finished a 12-hour on-call night shift when he decides to go to his local supermarket to pick up some groceries on his way home. Whilst there, he hears someone shout for help. He rushes over to find a body lying on the floor. It appears that the person has fainted and hit their head on the floor, causing a significant head wound. James introduces himself as a doctor and applies pressure to the site of bleeding to stem blood flow, having checked that the patient was breathing. He asks for an ambulance to be called. James continues to monitor the patient’s breathing whilst applying pressure to the head wound. After a short while, an ambulance arrives and the paramedics take over. The supermarket manager takes down James’ details and asks for a description of what happened. The next day, James arrives at work and recounts the story to a colleague. His colleague expressed his concern at James’ actions, saying that he could get sued. Several days later, two letters arrive for James in the post. He becomes slightly anxious after hearing what his colleague had said about legal action. He opens the letters; one is from the supermarket manager and the other is from the patient. They both expressed their gratitude for his actions.\nQuestions\n\nWhat is a Good Samaritan act?\nIs there a legal duty to perform a Good Samaritan act?\nWhat standard of care would the doctor be held to in a court of law?\nIs there an ethical and professional duty to act as a Good Samaritan?"

Since coming home, her mother struggled to feed Lilly and ensure she put on weight. Her mother coped as well as she could but had to give up her job as an office manager, as she felt no one else could spend the time Lilly needed to feed. Lilly’s mother also has to look after her 3-year-old son, who is healthy. Lilly has no defined diagnosis and this makes managing her condition difficult. Her mother has consulted a number of different hospitals in a desperate attempt to help her daughter. Each hospital performed the same tests and came to the same conclusion – that Lilly was malnourished but no firm diagnosis could be made. At presentation, Lilly looks thin and small. Her mother says Lilly has not been able to keep anything down for days because she has been coughing. You think she looks a little dehydrated but otherwise not too bad. Her chest is clear. You ask for a chest X-ray to rule out a chest infection. The radiologist later alerts you to the multiple rib fractures of differing ages.

    "section": "Observational Studies",
    "text": "Observational Studies\n\nDefinition - In observational studies, the researcher describes what has been observed in a particular sample without intervening in the observed processes in any way. They include studies that can be called descriptive or analytical.\nTypes - Observational studies are divided into descriptive and analytical.\n\nDescriptive Studies - There is no control group for comparison. Descriptive studies are intended to describe the distribution of one or more variables without considering any cause-and-effect relationship. These studies are suitable for generating ideas and hypotheses for research projects.\nAnalytical Studies are used to test hypotheses about the significance of potetial factors for the occurrence of diseases. They go further by analysing relationships between health status and other variables\n\n\n\nDescriptive Studies\n\nCase Reports\n\nDefinition: Reporting events in a single individual is termed as a case report. They are easy to report but often sound anecdotal and are usually non-repeatable. There is a high likelihood of the conclusions drawn in this type of study being due to chance or errors. Nevertheless, they can be used to formulate hypotheses. They are widely used in research on rare diseases to present new conditions and syndromes or unusual presentations of common diseases.\nAdvantages:\n\nThe only way to describe and publish rare diseases and syndromes OR unusual presentations of common diseases.\nSource of hypotheses for etiology, treatment, and disease outcome, which can later be evaluated through more complex epidemiological studies.\nProvide detailed and crucial information on disease pathogenesis, development, and treatment.\nServe as a bridge between laboratory and clinical research work.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nHighly susceptible to systematic errors due to the small number of cases, especially when reports comment on treatment or survival.\nCannot be directly translated into clinical practice due to the high level of uncertainty.\n\n\nCase Series\n\nDefinition: This type of study tracks several individuals. Case series are suitable for studying rare diseases. They also have low evidential value but are extremely valuable for discovering new diseases, symptoms, etiological factors, correlational dependencies, and prognostic factors.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Studies\nIn this type of study, researchers report the similarities and differences between participants in two or more groups. These studies are suitable for investigating the relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Depending on the starting point and the temporal direction, they can be prospective or retrospective.\n\nEcological Studies\n\nDefinition: The units of analysis are populations (groups, communities, or political units). In these studies, data are not observed and collected for individual units but for larger groups. They are also called correlational studies and usually track changes in two or more variables at the community level over several consecutive years. Ecological studies can also be done by comparing populations in different places at the same time or, in a time series, by comparing the same population in one place at different times. Presumed “risk” factors are compared with “unexposed” population groups. It represents an efficient and cost-effective epidemiological design that can leverage data already collected for other purposes. Although simple to conduct and thus attractive, ecological studies are often difficult to interpret since it is seldom possible to examine directly the various potential explanations for findings. Ecological studies usually rely on data collected for other purposes; data on different exposures and on socioeconomic factors may not be available. In addition, since the unit of analysis is a group, the link between exposure and effect at the individual level can not be made. One attraction of ecological studies is that data can be used from populations with widely differing characteristics or extracted from different data sources.\nAdvantages:\n\nEasy data acquisition\nNo contact with individuals or follow-up required\nSources of hypotheses for the etiological link between exposure and disease.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack temporal dimension -&gt; cannot prove causality\nCannot prove that a causal relationship truly exists\nEcological fallacy - the error that occurs when researchers directly transfer observed associations and relationships from population to individual levels.\n\n\nCross-sectional Studies\n\nDefinition: Through this type of study, the frequency of exposure (risk factor) and the presence of an event (outcome) in a population can be determined at a specific point in time. Researchers do not follow up with the participants, so information about the temporal sequence of events cannot be provided. Cross-sectional studies measure the prevalence of disease and thus are often called prevalence studies. It is not easy to assess the reasons for associations shown in cross-sectional studies. The key question to be asked is whether the exposure precedes or follows the effect. If the exposure data are known to represent exposure before any effect occurred, the data from a cross-sectional study can be treated like data generated from a cohort study. Cross-sectional studies are relatively easy and inexpensive to conduct and are useful for investigating exposures that are fixed characteristics of individuals, such as ethnicity or blood group. In sudden outbreaks of disease, a cross-sectional study to measure several exposures can be the most convenient first step in investigating the cause. Data from cross-sectional studies are helpful in assessing the health care needs of populations. Data from repeated cross-sectional surveys using independent random samples with standardized definitions and survey methods provide useful indications of trends. Many countries conduct regular cross-sectional surveys on representative samples of their populations focusing on personal and demographic characteristics, illnesses and health-related habits. Frequency of disease and risk factors can then be examined in relation to age, sex and ethnicity. Cross-sectional studies of risk factors for chronic diseases have been done in a wide range of countries.\nAdvantages:\n\nCan study entire populations or representative samples\nProvide information about disease prevalence\nGood opportunities for generalizing results\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack a time dimension -&gt; cannot prove causality\nSusceptible to systematic errors related to sampling and classification\nDifficult to apply to rare diseases\n\n\nCase-Control Studies\n\nDefinition: In this type of study, participants are divided into two or more groups depending on the presence or absence of the outcome under investigation (disease, health condition). Participants who have experienced the event (cases) are compared with those where the event is absent (controls) regarding the presence of the studied risk factor in the past. Case-control studies are retrospective. They are suitable for investigating the causes of a specific event, especially valuable when there is a long period between exposure and outcome, as participants are not followed up. Case-control studies usually do not require much time and are not expensive, but sometimes it’s challenging to find an appropriate control group. Case-control studies provide a relatively simple way to investigate causes of diseases, especially rare diseases.\nSteps:\n\nThe first step in designing case-control studies is selecting cases.\nThe second step is matching - a procedure to balance the studied groups in terms of key socio-demographic factors (gender, race, age, education, socio-economic status, etc.). It is also applied to control their confounding effect on the outcome. It can be performed at the group (frequency matching) or individual level (pair matching).\nThe third step is eliminating systematic bias. The most common systematic errors in these studies are related to selection, information, mismatching, and overmatching.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSuitable for rare diseases\nTime and resource-efficient\nApplicable for quick assessment in chronic diseases\nCan be used to investigate new hypotheses\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nDifficult to establish whether the cause precedes the outcome\nSusceptible to systematic errors related to sampling and classification\nLack of representativeness\nIndirect risk assessment\nNot suitable for rare exposures\n\n\nCohort Studies - In this type of study, healthy participants are divided into two or more groups based on the presence or absence of a risk factor. They are followed up for a specified period, at the end of which the occurrence or absence of a predetermined event is determined. Usually cohort studies are prospective. They are suitable for establishing temporal cause-and-effect relationships and for studying multiple events\n\nDefinition: Cohort studies, also called follow-up or incidence studies, begin with a group of people who are free of disease, and who are classified into subgroups according to exposure to a potential cause of disease or outcome. Variables of interest are specified and measured and the whole cohort is followed up to see how the subsequent development of new cases of the disease (or other outcome) differs between the groups with and without exposure. Because the data on exposure and disease refer to different points in time, cohort studies are longitudinal. Cohort studies have been called prospective studies, but this terminology is confusing and should be avoided. The term “prospective” refers to the timing of data collection and not to the relationship between exposure and effect. Thus there can be both prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Cohort studies provide the best information about the causation of disease and the most direct measurement of the risk of developing disease. Although conceptually simple, cohort studies are major undertakings and may require long periods of follow-up since disease may occur a long time after exposure. For example, the induction period for leukaemia or thyroid cancer caused by radiation (i.e. the time required for the specific cause to produce an outcome) is many years and it is necessary to follow up study participants for a long time. Many exposures investigated are long-term in nature and accurate information about them requires data collection over long periods. However, in the case of tobacco use, many people have relatively stable habits and information about past and current exposure can be collected at the time the cohort is defined. In situations with sudden acute exposures, the cause-effect relationship for acute effects may be obvious, but cohort studies are also used to investigate late or chronic effects. As cohort studies start with exposed and unexposed people, the difficulty of measuring or finding existing data on individual exposures largely determines the feasibility of doing one of these studies. If the disease is rare in the exposed group as well as the unexposed group there may also be problems in obtaining a large enough study group. Since cohort studies take healthy people as their starting-point, it is possible to examine a range of outcomes(in contrast to what can be achieved in case-control studies). For example, the Framingham study– a cohort studythat began in 1948 – has investigated the risk factors fora wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and musculoskeletal disorders\nTypes:\n\nProspective cohort studies measure exposure in the cohort, then follow the cohort for a specified period and monitor the occurrence and development of the disease.\nRetrospective cohort studies involve the researcher identifying a population with existing historical exposure data. Then they analyze what happened to exposed and unexposed individuals over time, comparing disease occurrences in both groups. Compared to prospective, retrospective cohort studies take relatively less time since the follow-up period has already ended.\n\nExamples: A classic example of a cohort study is the Framingham Heart Study, conducted jointly by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (USA) and Boston University. The goal of the Framingham Heart Study is to identify common factors leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by following them over a long period in a large group of participants without apparent symptoms of CVD or without experiencing a heart attack or stroke. Careful observation of the study samples over the years has helped uncover the major risk factors for CVD - high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and lack of physical activity - as well as valuable information on other factors related to this issue, such as levels of blood triglycerides and HDL, age, gender, and psychological factors. This study has resulted in the publication of around 1400 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of modern medicine and has led to the development of effective treatment and prevention in clinical practice.\nAdvantages:\n\nSuitable for rare exposures\nCan establish cause-and-effect relationships\nProvide information on incidence\nCan study multiple outcomes of one exposure\nLess sensitive to errors due to subjectivity and technical reasons\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nExpensive and time-consuming\nPrematurely lost patients can lead to selection bias\nRequire large populations and samples\nEthical issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizes the applications of different observational studies"

    "text": "Experimental Studies\nIntervention or experimentation involves attempting to change a variable in one or more groups of people. This could mean the elimination of a dietary factor thought to cause allergy, or testing a new treatment on a selected group of patients. The effects of an intervention are measured by comparing the outcome in the experimental group with that in a control group. Since the interventions are strictly determined by the study protocol, ethical considerations are of paramount importance in the design of these studies. For example, no patient should be denied appropriate treatment as a result of participation in an experiment, and the treatment being tested must be acceptable in the light of current knowledge. Informed consent from study participants is required in almost all circumstances.\nNB! Studying risk factors is illegal.\n\nDefinition - Experimental studies involve interventional research where the exposure under investigation is applied by the researcher. The goal of experimental studies is to reveal possible cause-and-effect relationships by exposing one or more groups of patients to the action of a given factor (treatment) and then comparing the results with one or more control groups that have not been exposed to the same factor. In this type of study, the researcher decides which subjects should be “exposed” and which should not, which is why in epidemiology, experimental studies are considered the closest analogue to laboratory experiments.\nTypes of Studies\n\nCommunity Trials - Investigational studies conducted in real human communities, which may include interventions at individual levels, group levels, as well as mixed approaches.\nClinical Trials - Investigational studies testing new methods for screening, prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease conducted in a hospital setting.\nLaboratory Experimental Studies - Investigational studies typically conducted on animals or tissues in laboratories.\n\nTypes of Interventions\n\nPreventive - Aimed at prevention (e.g., testing a new vaccine).\nDiagnostic - Aimed at evaluating a new diagnostic procedure (e.g., comparing a new laboratory test with the gold standard).\nTherapeutic - Aimed at treatment (e.g., testing a new drug).\n\nTypes of Control Groups\n\nPlacebo Control Group\nDose-Response Control Group\nActive Control Group\nNo-Treatment Control Group\nHistorical Control Group\n\n\nScientific control in experimental methods is intended to minimize the effects of variables other than the independent variable. This approach significantly increases the reliability of the results obtained. Using controlled experiments eliminates the possibility of experimental errors and biases by the researcher. The controlled experiment compares the results obtained from experimental samples with control samples that are identical to the experimental ones except for one aspect, the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).\n\nNon-Randomized Concurrent Controlled Trials\nIn this type of study, the control group consists of participants treated at approximately the same time as the experimental group. Participants are allocated to one of the groups, but not at random - for example, comparing mortality rates from two hospitals, one of which uses an innovative health product while the other uses a standard one. Non-randomized studies have some advantages over randomized ones, such as addressing the ethical issue of treatment differences between groups and a greater likelihood of participation due to the lack of randomization. However, they also have several weaknesses:\n\nThe two groups may not be entirely comparable.\nLower sensitivity to detecting statistically significant differences, leading to the need to increase the sample size.\nPossibility of errors in participant allocation.\n\nThe advantages of non-randomized studies in terms of cost, lower difficulty, and acceptability by researchers and participants must be carefully weighed against the possibility of error in each individual case.\n\n\nCross-Over Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials\nThis is a type of randomized clinical trial where each participant serves as their own control. In the simplest case, there are two study periods, during the first period each participant is in one of the two groups (experimental or control), and during the second period - in the other. This means that half of the participants receive the interventions in sequence I-II, while the other half receive them in sequence II-I. This should happen provided that the effect of the first intervention is calculated to prevent errors in the results. This type of design reduces the required number of participants and the variability of the results, as each participant serves as a control for the intervention. However, it cannot always be applied, for example, when curing the disease from the first intervention, the participant cannot return to the initial condition.\n\n\nFactorial Studies\nSome studies investigate more than one intervention simultaneously. This is done using a factorial design, where this type of study shows how different interventions interact. The design of factorial studies is usually 2x2, but can be more complex than a fourfold table. For example, the ACCORD study investigates strict versus more liberal control of blood glucose with strict control of blood pressure or lipid profile. This type of design can also be used in crossover trials. The disadvantage of this type of study is the possibility of interaction between interventions and the need for a larger sample size. If the lack of interaction can be guaranteed, a slight increase in the number of participants will allow two experiments to be conducted in one.\n\n\nDropout Studies\nIn many studies, participants who receive a certain treatment discontinue it or switch to a lower dose. The goal is to assess the response when the treatment is discontinued or the dose is reduced. This way, the duration of the effect of an already proven intervention can be evaluated. For example, in a study on arterial hypertension, only 5% of participants whose treatment was discontinued while maintaining their regular diet remained with normal blood pressure values, compared to 39% of participants whose treatment was discontinued but were given instructions to change their diet (weight reduction and decreased intake of table salt). A major drawback of these studies is the strict selection of participants. Only those deemed by the treating physician to benefit from their participation are likely to be included. Those experiencing significant adverse reactions are unlikely to continue their participation. This would lead to an overestimation of the treatment effect and an underestimation of toxicity. Another drawback is the change in participants’ condition and disease over time. The design of these studies must adhere to the same rules that apply to other studies. Randomization, blinding, and adequate data analysis are equally important here.\n\n\nAdaptive Design Studies\nAdaptive design allows modification of the study protocol after obtaining new data, usually in the early phases. Many clinical trials are adaptive, with their protocol allowing changes in the intervention to achieve a certain goal.\nUsually, adaptations include:\n\nchanges in the dosing regimen of the intervention group;\nchange in therapy in the intervention or control group;\nadapting the sample size;\nadapting the study protocol after the occurrence of a specific event. A significant weakness of adaptive design is the potential for errors in implementing the adaptation.\n\n\n\nRandomized Clinical Trial (RCT)\n\nDefinition - A prospective study that evaluates the effect of a given intervention by comparing outcomes for participants between randomly assigned treated and control groups. RCTs are the gold standard for introducing new drugs.\nPhases\n\nPhase I - an early study to determine the levels of non-toxic doses in animals or small groups of healthy volunteers. It assesses the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of therapy.\n\nSingle Ascending Dose (SAD) Study - small doses of the drug are given to groups of several patients and observed for a certain period. If no side effects occur, a larger dose is given to another group of patients, and so on until intolerable side effects appear. At this stage, it is said that the drug has reached the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nMultiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Study - conducted to gain a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. In this study, a group of patients receives a low dose of the drug, with this dose sequentially increased to a predetermined level. Biological samples are regularly collected and analyzed to understand the drug’s metabolism in vivo.\n\nPhase II - evaluates the clinical efficacy of the therapy.\n\nPhase IIA - assesses dosing requirements.\nPhase IIB - assesses efficacy.\n\nPhase III - confirms effectiveness, monitors side effects, and compares with other treatment alternatives. Successful RCTs in this phase may apply for registration and marketing approval from regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and others.\nPhase IV - aims to discover rare and long-term side effects among a much larger population over an extended period of time.\n\nTerms\n\nRandomization - a method of assigning patients to two or more therapeutic options in which each patient has an equal chance of receiving any of the treatments. It minimizes differences between groups due to systematic error and potential confounding factors by evenly distributing individuals with certain characteristics among the groups (experimental and control).\n\nSimple randomization - random allocation of patients to groups, usually using a table of random numbers or computer-generated random numbers.\nCluster (block) randomization - conducted in groups of patients (clusters) or communities, where units are randomly allocated to intervention or non-intervention.\nStratified randomization - conducted in non-homogeneous populations within the groups, depending on specific participant characteristics (age, gender, or disease severity). The aim is to ensure a good balance of these factors across the groups.\n\nBlinding - a method that ensures that the subject, investigator, or outcome assessor is unaware of the intervention allocation. Masking is used to reduce potential systematic error.\n\nOpen-label study - all participants are aware of the assigned treatment.\nSingle-blind - only the subject is unaware of the assigned treatment.\nDouble-blind - both the subject and the investigator are unaware of the assigned treatment.\nTriple-blind - the subject, investigator, and outcome assessor are unaware of the assigned treatment.\n\nAllocation concealment - a term used to describe the procedure for protecting randomization so that treatment allocation remains unknown until the patient is enrolled in the study. Researchers are unaware of the exact details of the chosen randomization. Allocation concealment can be achieved through:\n\nSequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE).\nSequentially numbered containers.\nPharmacologically controlled.\nCentral randomization.\n\nCompliance - determines how strictly patients randomized in a given study follow medical recommendations and treatment. This is an important element, especially in outpatient clinical trials.\nPlacebo - a pharmaceutical substance that does not contain an active ingredient. In blinded studies, a placebo is often designed to mimic the active product.\nMulticenter study - conducted in more than one medical center or hospital, thereby recruiting a larger number of participants. It allows for the inclusion of a wider range of population groups and comparison of results between centers.\nN-of-1 clinical trial - a patient is given one treatment or another (or placebo), using a double-blind method for a short period of time. Results are evaluated after each period.\nWashout period - a period in a clinical trial during which subjects do not receive treatment, thereby eliminating the effects of previous treatments.\nIntention-to-treat analysis - analysis according to the assigned treatment received by the patients. The effect of a treatment may be best assessed by assessing the subject’s treatment intentions (the planned treatment regimen) rather than the treatment actually administered.\nExplanatory analysis - analysis based on the treatment received for which patients were randomized.\nEfficacy - the ability of the treatment to produce beneficial effects at the tested dose and for the disease for which it is intended.\nEffectiveness - the desired measure of the action of the drug on a given disease or condition, demonstrated by unequivocal facts from adequate and well-controlled studies.\n\nAdvantages\n\nProvide strong evidence of causality.\nCan investigate multiple outcomes from a single exposure.\nAllow for fewer systematic errors related to observation, subjectivity, technical details.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nExpensive and time-consuming.\nPrematurely dropped patients can lead to selection bias.\nEthical issues (Researching risk factors is prohibited)."

A major drawback of these studies is the strict selection of participants. Only those deemed by the treating physician to benefit from their participation are likely to be included. Those experiencing significant adverse reactions are unlikely to continue their participation. This would lead to an overestimation of the treatment effect and an underestimation of toxicity. Another drawback is the change in participants’ condition and disease over time. The design of these studies must adhere to the same rules that apply to other studies. Randomization, blinding, and adequate data analysis are equally important here."

Many clinical trials are adaptive, with their protocol allowing changes in the intervention to achieve a certain goal.\nUsually, adaptations include:\n\nchanges in the dosing regimen of the intervention group;\nchange in therapy in the intervention or control group;\nadapting the sample size;\nadapting the study protocol after the occurrence of a specific event. A significant weakness of adaptive design is the potential for errors in implementing the adaptation."

    "text": "Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT)\n\nDefinition - A prospective study that evaluates the effect of a given intervention by comparing outcomes for participants between randomly assigned treated and control groups. RCTs are the gold standard for introducing new drugs.\nPhases\n\nPhase I - an early study to determine the levels of non-toxic doses in animals or small groups of healthy volunteers. It assesses the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of therapy.\n\nSingle Ascending Dose (SAD) Study - small doses of the drug are given to groups of several patients and observed for a certain period. If no side effects occur, a larger dose is given to another group of patients, and so on until intolerable side effects appear. At this stage, it is said that the drug has reached the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nMultiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Study - conducted to gain a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. In this study, a group of patients receives a low dose of the drug, with this dose sequentially increased to a predetermined level. Biological samples are regularly collected and analyzed to understand the drug’s metabolism in vivo.\n\nPhase II - evaluates the clinical efficacy of the therapy.\n\nPhase IIA - assesses dosing requirements.\nPhase IIB - assesses efficacy.\n\nPhase III - confirms effectiveness, monitors side effects, and compares with other treatment alternatives. Successful RCTs in this phase may apply for registration and marketing approval from regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and others.\nPhase IV - aims to discover rare and long-term side effects among a much larger population over an extended period of time.\n\nTerms\n\nRandomization - a method of assigning patients to two or more therapeutic options in which each patient has an equal chance of receiving any of the treatments. It minimizes differences between groups due to systematic error and potential confounding factors by evenly distributing individuals with certain characteristics among the groups (experimental and control).\n\nSimple randomization - random allocation of patients to groups, usually using a table of random numbers or computer-generated random numbers.\nCluster (block) randomization - conducted in groups of patients (clusters) or communities, where units are randomly allocated to intervention or non-intervention.\nStratified randomization - conducted in non-homogeneous populations within the groups, depending on specific participant characteristics (age, gender, or disease severity). The aim is to ensure a good balance of these factors across the groups.\n\nBlinding - a method that ensures that the subject, investigator, or outcome assessor is unaware of the intervention allocation. Masking is used to reduce potential systematic error.\n\nOpen-label study - all participants are aware of the assigned treatment.\nSingle-blind - only the subject is unaware of the assigned treatment.\nDouble-blind - both the subject and the investigator are unaware of the assigned treatment.\nTriple-blind - the subject, investigator, and outcome assessor are unaware of the assigned treatment.\n\nAllocation concealment - a term used to describe the procedure for protecting randomization so that treatment allocation remains unknown until the patient is enrolled in the study. Researchers are unaware of the exact details of the chosen randomization. Allocation concealment can be achieved through:\n\nSequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE).\nSequentially numbered containers.\nPharmacologically controlled.\nCentral randomization.\n\nCompliance - determines how strictly patients randomized in a given study follow medical recommendations and treatment. This is an important element, especially in outpatient clinical trials.\nPlacebo - a pharmaceutical substance that does not contain an active ingredient. In blinded studies, a placebo is often designed to mimic the active product.\nMulticenter study - conducted in more than one medical center or hospital, thereby recruiting a larger number of participants. It allows for the inclusion of a wider range of population groups and comparison of results between centers.\nN-of-1 clinical trial - a patient is given one treatment or another (or placebo), using a double-blind method for a short period of time. Results are evaluated after each period.\nWashout period - a period in a clinical trial during which subjects do not receive treatment, thereby eliminating the effects of previous treatments.\nIntention-to-treat analysis - analysis according to the assigned treatment received by the patients. The effect of a treatment may be best assessed by assessing the subject’s treatment intentions (the planned treatment regimen) rather than the treatment actually administered.\nExplanatory analysis - analysis based on the treatment received for which patients were randomized.\nEfficacy - the ability of the treatment to produce beneficial effects at the tested dose and for the disease for which it is intended.\nEffectiveness - the desired measure of the action of the drug on a given disease or condition, demonstrated by unequivocal facts from adequate and well-controlled studies.\n\nAdvantages\n\nProvide strong evidence of causality.\nCan investigate multiple outcomes from a single exposure.\nAllow for fewer systematic errors related to observation, subjectivity, technical details.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nExpensive and time-consuming.\nPrematurely dropped patients can lead to selection bias.\nEthical issues (Researching risk factors is prohibited)."

Това позволява да се правят полезни прогнози. Подобни “модели” са изключително важни в епидемиологията и клиничната медицина, а най-често използваният метод за тяхното създаване е линейната регресия.\nПроменливата, чиито стойности се предсказват в регресионния модел се нарича зависима (резултативна), докато променливата, която се използва за предсказване и построяването на модела се нарича независима (факторна). В своята същност, регресионния анализ достига до “уравнение” (математическа функция) чрез което в аналитичен вид се представя връзката между определен набор от фактори и резултативното явление. Регресионното уравнение се представя като:\n\\[{y} = {a} + {\\beta}\\cdot{x}\\]\n\n\nНека приемем за зависима променлива \\(y\\) - тегло на студентите от 2-ри курс, а за независима \\(x\\) - калорийния им прием. Чрез линейната регресия връзката между тези променливи може да се моделира, така че при известни стойности за калорийния прием, да предскажем теглото на студента. Регресионният модел следва формулата: \\({y} = {a} + {\\beta}\\cdot{x}\\), в която:\n\nКоефициентът \\({a}\\) е константа (intercept).\n\nСтойността коефициента показва, какво е теглото, когато калорийният прием е нула. С други думи, \\({a}\\) посочва началната точка на взаимовръзката между тегло и калорийния прием и на практика, няма практическо значение в интерпретацията на модела, тя служи единствено за математическото моделиране.\n\n\\({\\beta}\\) е регресионният коефициент.\n\nТова е число, което показва силата и посоката на връзката между предиктора (калорийния прием) и резултативната променлива (теглото). Математически, за установяване на стойността на \\(y\\), трябва да умножи регресионния коефициент \\({\\beta}\\) с известната стойност калорийния прием \\(x\\). Отрицателните стойности на \\({\\beta}\\) означават негативна (обратна) корелационна връзка, а позитивните стойности - позитивна (права)."

    "text": "Communication when patients are approaching death\nFor some death comes quickly and unexpectedly but for many patients there is a period of time when it is clear that death is approaching. This should be identified as early as possible (ideally, when death is likely to occur within 12 months) so that discussion and planning with the patient can take place, without urgency. It is a time for helping patients and families to come to terms with the situation. Within palliative care services, considerable attention has been given to developing good communication strategies to handle difficult situations openly, such as when patients ask for details about how their death will occur, and to the use of verbal and non-verbal skills to facilitate discussion\n\nPatients with capacity\nWhen making decisions about ongoing treatment and resuscitation with someone who has capacity, the doctor’s duty is to explain to the patient their options in a clear and honest manner. The doctor may advise, but must not put undue pressure on a patient to pursue a particular course of action. A patient with capacity might make decisions about there care that seem unwise to the medical team, for example, he might refuse surgery for a curable cancer. If a decision seems bizarre, it is acceptable to explore sensitively the reasoning behind it; however, the patient retains the right to control what happens to his body, and his decisions must be respected and acted upon, even if they are not rational or understood. Although adults with capacity may refuse treatment, no patient may demand treatment that the doctor does not deem to be in his best interests.\n\n\nPatients lacking capacity\nBefore losing capacity, a patient may entrust to another who is then authorized to make decisions on their behalf when capacity is diminished. the attorney must have been granted specifically the power to make medical decisions. The attorney must make decisions in the patient’s best interests and not simply make substituted judgements. Efforts should also be made to discover if the patient has made any advance decisions about their end of life care. These decisions may be recorded in legally drawn up documents or take the form of conversations recorded in the hospital notes. It is good practice to get the patient to countersign the transcript of any conversation where significant decisions are made during an admission. As stated previously, advance requests for treatment are not legally binding, although they help gain an insight into the patient’s wishes and so will be given weight when deciding how to proceed in their best interests. In some countries a valid advance refusal of treatment is legally binding and must be respected.\n\n\nThe patient who ‘doesn’t want to know’\nIf a patient does not wish to know the facts surrounding their illness or condition, sensitive attempts should be made to find out why. the patient’s worries should be addressed but if all attempts to help them engage in conversation fail, their wishes must be respected. No one else may give consent to treatment or investigation on their behalf while they retain capacity, even at the patient’s request. for consent to be legally valid, it must be ‘informed’, and so this leaves the medical team in a difficult position should they wish to proceed to investigation and treatment as, technically, they are committing assault because the patient’s consent is not truly valid. this dilemma should be explained to the patient. Most doctors would agree that they would proceed, pragmatically. Without bullying or coercion, the patient’s decision to remain ignorant should be revisited regularly. All discussion should be recorded in the notes.\n\n\nDiscussions with family members\nFamilies often have complicated dynamics. If a patient has capacity, they must give their permission before information about them can be discussed with anyone else. In the case of those who lack capacity, it is reasonable to assume that they would want those closest to them to be kept informed of their condition.\n\n\nCommunicating with complementary therapists\nSome disciplines, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, are professionally regulated and so health professionals can liaise with such practitioners with confidence that they are competent in the therapies they provide and are legally accountable for them. Others, such as herbal medicine and homeopathy are not regulated in the same way, but claim to provide diagnosis and treatment. Doctors may be worried if patients choose these and decline treatments for which there is evidence of benefit. In such cases, they need to talk to the patient about their concerns, while recognising that ultimately patients can choose whichever therapy they want Among the therapies that are often used by patients to supplement conventional medicine but which do not claim to have any diagnostic purpose are aromatherapy, massage, stress therapy, reflexology and hypnotherapy. Practitioners of these therapies can provide supportive care without impeding conventional treatment. Some other alternative disciplines which do not impede conventional care are perceived as lacking any credible evidence base, such as crystal therapy and iridology. Among the complementary disciplines that claim to provide diagnoses and treatment are Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Patients may derive a sense of reassurance that they are trying all options if they embark on such alternative solutions. Dilemmas arise for the healthcare team if patients appear to be pursuing unproven therapies that are potentially harmful or which they cannot afford. It can also be problematic if unregulated practitioners request medical tests or results from the healthcare team. Generally, doctors would need to be convinced that such interventions are necessary in the patient’s interests before providing them."

A valid competent advance decision refusing some or all medical treatment (a ‘living will’) is likely to be binding on health professionals.\nAdvance care planning is defined as: ’a process of discussion between an individual and their care providers irrespective of discipline. If the individual wishes, their family and friends may be included. With the individual’s agreement, discussion should be:\n\ndocumented;\nregularly reviewed;\ncommunicated to key people involved in his or her care.\n\nExamples of what might be included are the individual’s:\n\nconcerns\nvalues or personal care goals\nunderstanding about his or her illness and prognosis and particular preferences for types of care or treatment that may be beneficial in the future.’"

They centre on the need for good organisational planning, identifying early people who are approaching the end of life, consulting them about their wishes, having services continuously available day and night, ensuring that the workforce is trained in end of life care and monitoring and auditing the quality of that care. Ways of measuring whether patient choice works in practice include defined outcome measures, such as whether patients can be given a choice about place of death. Care standards are also measured through patient, carer and family feedback, such as by a patient or carer diary which can be more informative than questionnaires. Diaries of patients’ experiences can be compared and analysed to inform service improvements and may be less of an imposition than asking people to complete repeated questionnaires."

    "text": "The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient\nWhen patients are recognised as dying, their treatment needs to be continually monitored and assessed. The best known tool to manage the care of dying adults is the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP). The LCP was developed in the late 1990s and has been continuously updated. In 2004, it was highlighted as an example of best practice. LCP generic version helps health professionals to focus on care in the last hours or days of a patient’s life, ensuring that high quality care is tailored to individuals’ needs when their death is expected. As with all other clinical guidelines, the LCP does not replace clinical judgement. Using it requires regular assessment, reflection, critical senior decision making and clinical skill. Changes in care at this complex, uncertain time need to be reviewed regularly by the multi-disciplinary team so that decisions are made in the best interests of patients with input from their family or carers. The LCP does not preclude the use of clinically assisted nutrition or hydration or antibiotics; all such decisions should reflect an assessment of the patient’s best interests. The responsibility for the use of the LCP generic document as part of a continuous quality improvement programme sits within the governance of an organisation and must be underpinned by an education and training programme. The main goals of the LCP are given below\n\nGoal 1.1 The patient is able to take a full and active part in communication\nGoal 1.2 The relative or carer is able to take a full and active part in communication\nGoal 1.3 The patient is aware that they are dying\nGoal 1.4 The relative or carer is aware that the patient is dying\nGoal 1.5 The clinical team have up-to-date contact information for the relative or carer as documented below\nGoal 2 The relative or carer has had a full explanation of the facilities available to them and a facilities leaflet has been given\nGoal 3.1 The patient is given the opportunity to discuss what is important to them at this time (e.g. their wishes, feelings, faith, beliefs, values)\nGoal 3.2 The relative or carer is given the opportunity to discuss what is important to them at this time (e.g. their wishes, feelings, faith, beliefs, values)\nGoal 4.1 The patient has medication prescribed on a prn (if needed) basis for all of the following five symptoms which may develop in the last hours or days of life:\n\npain\nagitation\nrespiratory tract secretions\nnausea/vomiting\ndyspnoea.\n\nGoal 4.2 Equipment is available for the patient to support a continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of medication where required\nGoal 5.1 The patient’s need for current interventions has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\n\nroutine blood tests\nintravenous antibiotics\nblood glucose monitoring\nrecording of routine vital signs\noxygen therapy\n\nGoal 5.2 The patient has a ‘do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation order’ in place\nGoal 5.3 Implantable cardioverter defibrillator is deactivated\nGoal 6 The need for clinically assisted (artificial) nutrition is reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\nGoal 7 The need for clinically assisted (artificial) hydration is reviewed by the multidisciplinary team\nGoal 8 The patient’s skin integrity is assessed\nGoal 9.1 A full explanation of the current plan of care (LCP) is given to the patient\nGoal 9.2 A full explanation of the current plan of care (LCP) is given to the relative or carer\nGoal 9.3 The LCP Coping with dying leaflet or equivalent is given to the relative or carer\nGoal 9.4 The patient’s primary health care team/GP practice is notified that the patient is dying\n\n\n\n\nThe Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient algorithm.

    "text": "Use of opioids and sedatives\n\nThe principle of double effect\nThe principle of ‘double effect’ allows doctors to provide medical treatment that has both bad and good effects, as long as the intention is to provide an overall good effect. They can give sedatives and analgesics with the intention of, and in proportion to, the relief of suffering, even if as a consequence the patient’s life risks being shortened. The moral distinction is between intending and foreseeing the harm. The intention of giving the drugs is to relieve pain and distress; the harmful, but unintended, effect is the risk of shortening life, which the doctor may foresee but not intend.\nPain-relieving drugs, such as morphine, do not necessarily hasten death but a common example of double effect is using morphine when it might do so. The administration of drugs which might hasten death is lawful and ethical when patients are terminally ill or dying, the drugs are in their best interests and the doctor’s motive is the relief of suffering, not causing death. The actual treatment and dosage must be recognised as reasonable and proper within the profession. Although the ethical and legal situation is clear, some doctors remain anxious about the degree of pain relief they can provide. They might be reluctant to increase a drug dosage to cope with patient’s intractable pain or distress, in which case they need to take specialist advice. Some patients have been fearful that their mental distress or sense of panic, as well as physical symptoms, would not be adequately managed at the end of life.\n\n\nSedation at the end of life\nAlleviating suffering is a very high priority in end of life care but intentionally reducing patients’ awareness, even with their consent, is a serious matter requiring careful examination of doctors’ motives and the availability of possible alternatives. Clearly, sedation can never be a substitute for personalised assessment and treatment of patients’ physical symptoms and their psychological distress. Some people experience severe symptoms in the final days of life, either due to the terminal illness or to coexisting pathologies. Specialist palliative care teams help patients with previously intractable pain, delirium, anxiety or dyspnoea to become comfortable and, in the majority of cases, symptom control can be achieved. In some cases, medication is given with the intention of relieving pain or agitation with the knowledge that one of the side effects is temporary sedation. Because the aim is to relieve patients’ distress, often this does not mean reducing their consciousness to a level where all communication with them is impossible. Various terms are used in the international literature to describe a deep level of sedation, including ‘end of life sedation’, ‘total sedation’, ‘controlled sedation’, ‘sedation for intractable distress in the imminently dying’. Although there has been much debate on the subject, lack of common definitions has made it difficult to evaluate how much or how little, sedation is used and in what circumstances."

    "text": "Spiritual and pastoral care\nOne facet of ‘whole person’ care is offering the opportunity to receive spiritual or psychological support. For many patients, the spiritual dimension is immensely important, and particularly so at the end of life. This is not restricted to people who have a particular philosophy, world view or religious belief; many who have none of these things would like support to help them think about the values that have been important to them. A range of advisers may be helpful, including humanist counsellors, as well as hospital chaplains, rabbis, imams or other faith-based spiritual advisers. In a multifaith, multi-cultural society, it is important that professionals providing care and support to people nearing the end of life take account of individuals’ varying spiritual needs. Ideally, these should be assessed before people reach the terminal or dying phase of illness. This gives them time to explore issues that may be troubling them before they reach the very end of life. When patients wish to talk to a hospital chaplain or other religious or spiritual adviser, every effort should be made to accommodate this but confidential information about patients should not be given to spiritual advisers by health professionals, without prior patient consent. Alternatively, the dying person may indicate a desire to discuss personal, moral or spiritual problems with health professionals."

It focuses on enhancement of quality of life for the child and support for the family and includes the management of distressing symptoms, provision of respite and care through death and bereavement. It centres on ‘the need to maintain quality of life, not just in the dying stages, but also in the weeks, months and years before death and is characterised by concern for symptom relief, promotion of general well-being and psychological and social comfort for the child and family’. Such care involves an active approach to the management of the child’s symptoms and the provision of psychological, emotional and social support which ideally begins long before the dying stage. It requires the provision of flexible respite care and support for the family and siblings, throughout the illness, death and bereavement. Children and young people often have complex, long-term conditions that require more specialist care and higher levels of home and community support than adults. Care also needs to take account of the child’s or young person’s emotional and cognitive development. Educational needs and the provision of play therapies may have to be planned. The continuing physical, emotional and cognitive development of children also influences all aspects of their care. The transition between active treatment and palliative care is often less clear for children than for adults, particularly when children have genetic disorders with different clinical manifestations to those encountered in other life-threatening conditions. Many professional and voluntary agencies are involved in different aspects of the care of a seriously ill child and the family."

Although expected deaths do not represent a shock to the staff who have been caring for the patient, the death of a loved one, however expected, is often a shock for friends and family. Much preparatory work falls to the nursing staff or to GPs. After the patient has died, it is usual and comforting to see death as a release for the patient, but a sense of guilt and fear of criticism often prevent people from also admitting beforehand that the death of the patient may represent a relief for them. The family should be encouraged to discuss any concerns and, if appropriate, should be offered counselling. For parents, the death of a child is the most devastating experience they can have. Hospitals should have appropriate policies in place so that staff are aware of the needs of different cultures at this time and so that the family can be given information, if relevant, about asking for a post-mortem examination or donating tissue or organs."

It is normally applied to patients who voluntarily seek to end heir lives and who have a terminal or degenerative condition. It includes euthanasia and physician assisted suicide but does not cover non-treatment decisions.\nEuthanasia literally means a gentle or easy death. It is sometimes called ‘mercy killing’. It describes deliberate steps by someone – usually a health professional – to end a patient’s life.\n\n-Withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment is fundamentally different from assisted dying. Doctors must withhold or withdraw treatment when a patient with capacity refuses it or when a patient who lacks capacity has made a valid advance decision to refuse it. Nor can doctors give treatment that is futile in that it cannot achieve its aim or cannot provide a ‘benefit’ to the patient\n\nSlippery slope is the metaphor often invoked in debates about assisted dying to describe situations in which one action might possibly be seen as permissible but would lead to undesirable consequences. Once an accepted boundary is breached, the argument goes, there will be no way of preventing a slide down the slippery slope to the breaching of other standards."

In terms of rights and consequences, assisted dying would allow some patients to achieve their aim of controlling their death and avoiding a situation which they fear will involve suffering or indignity. The main argument in favour of assisted dying focuses on this concept of patients’ rights to choose.\n\nIn terms of deontology, doctors have duties to respect patient choice and minimise suffering. They have special duties to their patients and cannot abandon patients who have unbearable pain.\nHuman rights also provide a similar focus on individual entitlements.\nQuality of life is often portrayed as being more important than the patient’s length of life and issues around sanctity of life.\nOpinion polls appear to show that the public support assisted dying being available in some cases.\nBoth sides of the argument raise questions about the kind of society we want and whether respect for choices and compassion for suffering should overrule other considerations\n\n\n\nArguments opposing assisted dying\nArguments against assisted dying are also consequentialist and deontological. The consequentialist argument is that permitting assisted dying for some would put large numbers of other people at risk of harm.\n\nThe deontological argument is that this would be contrary to the ethics of clinical practice. The purpose of medicine is perceived as being to improve patients’ quality of life and the opposite of trying to foreshorten it.\nThe issue of sanctity of life is sometimes raised as a cogent reason against assisted dying (although many opponents of assisted dying do not subscribe to the notion that life must be preserved at all costs, regardless of its quality).\nIt would weaken society’s prohibition on killing and undermine the safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia. Society would embark on a ‘slippery slope’ with undesirable consequences.\nEffective and high quality palliative care can effectively alleviate distressing symptoms associated with the dying process and allay patients’ fears.\nOnly a minority of people want to end their lives. The rules for the majority should not be changed to accommodate a small group.\nBoth sides of the argument raise questions about the kind of society we want and whether concern for the vulnerable and respect for life should count for more than individual autonomy."

It has been many months since Bertie has been able to speak or leave his bed, and he no longer appears to recognise his family.

Risk feeding acknowledges that there is a risk of choking and food or drink going into the lungs of a patient unable to swallow safely. This risk may be seen as acceptable if withholding food or drink is felt to be inappropriate, for instance if the patient is in the last days of life.

    "text": "Diagnosing the dying patient and preparing for death\nPatients should be diagnosed as early as possible. In some cases, recognising that a patient has a limited life expectancy may occur 12 months or so in advance of death. One of the tools that has been developed to identify such patients, and provide care for them in their last year, is the Gold Standards Framework. Originally developed in 2000 in England by the Department of Health End of Life Programme for use in a primary care setting, it was subsequently extended to other parts of the UK and to other care settings. Its main aims are to identify patients who will need palliative or supportive care, assess their needs, preferences and issues important to them and plan around those needs and preferences. It seeks to develop guidance that clinicians are able to recognise when a patient is dying, particularly when the individual enters the last hours or days of life.\nThe diagnosis of dying is often complex, irrespective of previous diagnosis or history. Uncertainty is frequently an integral part of the process and there are occasions when a patient who was thought to be dying lives longer than expected and vice versa. In 2009, for example, an analysis of over 4,500 hospital deaths indicated that health professionals were sometimes unable to judge that patients were dying. This led to inadequate implementation of appropriate care and poor communication with patients, relatives and in health teams. Even when it was clearly recognised on admission that some patients could not survive long, discussion that should have taken place about treatment limitation did not occur. When dying patients are correctly assessed, practical planning tools help to manage their current symptoms and anticipate others likely to occur. They help health professionals assess what medication may be needed to maintain symptom control and whether consideration should be given to withdrawing medication that is no longer achieving its therapeutic aim. These pathways require regular and frequent review of the patient’s condition by the healthcare team so that drug doses can be tailored to match the individual patient’s needs. The use of pathways in the final days of life appears more evident with adult rather than paediatric patients, for whom the range of life-limiting conditions is very broad."

    "text": "The increasing ability of people to exercise control over fertility and reproduction has led to major changes in the way people live their lives. Women are now able to exercise choice over whether and when to have children to a greater extent than ever before. Although emphasis is often placed on the provision of contraception to young women, boys and men also need advice about contraception and sexual health. Similarly, although decisions about the progress of a pregnancy ultimately rest with the woman carrying the fetus, fathers also have a role in decision making, particularly when they intend to take an active part in bringing up the child. Reproduction differs from many other areas of medical practice because of its complexity and because tension can sometimes arise between the rights of women to make decisions about their own bodies and the moral duties owed to embryos and fetuses. It is this aspect of reproduction that is at the root of many of the ethical, legal, social and psychological questions that continue to be of concern to society. Control over one’s body, abortion, reproduction and parenthood are matters about which most people hold strong views. For many, such views are based on moral, religious or cultural convictions. Given the existence of such diversity of opinion, it is clear that some of these questions can never be resolved to the satisfaction of all sections of society, but will be the subject of continuing ethical debate. Broad areas of moral consensus can, however, be sketched out after wide ranging consultation and public debate, and these form the basis of legislation, guidance and practice in this area."

These arguments tend not to consider the fetus to be a person, deserving of any rights or owed any duties. Those who judge actions by their consequences alone could argue that abortion is equivalent to a deliberate failure to conceive a child and, because contraception is widely available, abortion should be too. Others take a slightly different approach, believing that, even if the fetus has rights and entitlements, these are very limited and do not weigh significantly against the interests of people who have already been born, such as parents or existing children of the family. Most people believe it is right for couples to be able to plan their families and for women to have control over when they become pregnant. Although contraception is understood to be the appropriate means to avoid unwanted pregnancy, all methods have a failure rate. When contraception fails, or when couples fail to use it effectively, many people accept that abortion is preferable to forcing a woman to continue with an unwanted pregnancy."

    "text": "Arguments against abortion\nSome people consider that abortion is wrong in any circumstance because it fails to recognise the rights of the fetus or because it challenges the notion of the sanctity of all human life. They argue that permitting abortion diminishes the respect society feels for other vulnerable humans, possibly leading to their involuntary euthanasia. Those who consider that an embryo is a human being with full moral status from the moment of conception see abortion as intentional killing in the same sense as the murder of any other person. Those who take this view cannot accept that women should be allowed to obtain abortions, however difficult the lives of those women or their existing families are made as a result. Such views may be based on religious or moral convictions that each human life has unassailable intrinsic value, which is not diminished by any impairment or suffering that may be involved for the individual living that life. Many worry that the availability of abortion on grounds of fetal abnormality encourages prejudice towards any person with a handicap and insidiously creates the impression that the only valuable people are those who conform to some ill-defined stereotype of ‘normality’. More recently, some have shifted the arguments on to the pregnant woman and have argued that abortion is wrong because of the psychological and health consequences for a woman, although evidence in support of this is elusive and controversial. Some of those who oppose abortion in general nevertheless concede that it may be justifiable in very exceptional cases when termination is seen as the lesser moral offence. This could include cases such as where the pregnancy is the result of rape, or the consequence of the exploitation of a young girl or a woman lacking capacity. Risk to the mother’s life may be another justifiable exception, but only when abortion is the only option. It would thus not be seen as justifiable to abort a fetus if the life of both fetus and mother could be saved by implementing any other solution."

It is a personal choice made by the pregnant person due to various factors, such as their life circumstances, financial situation, or personal beliefs.\nThe legality and availability of social abortions can vary widely from one region or country to another. Some places may have strict regulations or restrictions on elective abortions, while others may have more permissive laws.\n\nCriminal Abortion:\n\nCriminal abortion refers to an abortion that is performed in violation of the laws of a particular jurisdiction. This can encompass a wide range of circumstances, such as performing an abortion without proper medical training or in a setting that doesn’t meet legal standards.\nCriminal abortion may also refer to cases where abortion is considered illegal, regardless of the circumstances.

    "text": "Surrogate Motherhood\nThe most significant deviation from natural conception and pregnancy is surrogate motherhood. Surrogacy arrangement means that the fetus is implanted into the womb of another woman who gives birth to the child and then gives the child to the “biological parents”. Surrogacy opens the door to severe abuse. The indication for surrogacy is often not a medical one, that is, the inability of the biological mother to carry a pregnancy and give birth, but rather the biological mother wants to avoid all the risks and discomforts of pregnancy and birth. In some parts of the world, for example, India, the so called rent-a-womb is already a well-established source of income for poor women. This practice is illegal in many countries and is ethically very problematic. Few healthy women would accept the role of a surrogate mother purely for altruistic motives, and in the large majority of cases, it is the money that drives the decision. Surrogate motherhood is a clear case of disrespect of the ethical principle of justice. Ethically, it is hard to defend exploitation of the poor, who are forced to put their health and well-being at risk. The second problematic issue is that pregnancy is not merely a waiting time, but rather a precious period for both parents to prepare for their new role. Talking, or singing to a child before birth, is a most common and enriching experience. Likewise, the father also gradually adapts to his new role. Thus, all events during pregnancy prepare the family for the great change in family life and for the (often difficult) period of caring for a newborn baby. This role of pregnancy as preparation for parenthood is missing if the only reminder of the new family member is a marked date on a calendar. Finally, we must also think of some unfortunate potential scenarios. What happens if the newborn child is not healthy? Would the “biological parents” return him or her as we do with malfunctioning washing machines in stores? If the surrogate mother during pregnancy or delivery gets a disease or even dies - who is responsible and who takes care of her other children?"

    "text": "Brain death\nMedicine and society continue to struggle thoughtfully with the definition of death, particularly with the progression of sophisticated life-support systems that challenge traditional concepts. The questions of when a disease is irreversible, when further treatment is ineffective, or when death has occurred are of great consequence. These questions are independent of, and galvanized by, the practice of organ donation.\nBrain death is defined as the absence of all brain function demonstrated by profound coma with the irreversible loss of capacity for consciousness, loss of the ability to breathe and absence of all brain stem reflexes. Analogous to a cardiac arrest, it is better understood as brain arrest – the loss of all clinical brain function. If a proximate cause is known and there are no reversible conditions present, death is determined by documenting the absence of brain function by clinical examination. In most cases, brain death can be diagnosed at the bedside. Common causes include trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accidents, hypoxia owing to resuscitation after cardiac arrest, drug overdose or near drowning, primary brain tumor, meningitis, homicide, and suicide.\nThe concept of brain death was influenced by two major health care advances in the 1960s: the development of intensive care units, with artificial airways and mechanical ventilators to treat irreversible apnea, thus interrupting the natural evolution from brain failure to cardiac arrest, and the emergence of organ donation arising from the new discipline of transplant surgery. An ethical consensus existed that the donation itself must not cause the death of the donor, commonly referred to as the “dead donor” rule. Advanced technologies also revealed the existing limitations in the lexicon of death. The word death may be inadequate to describe the event or process in the various domains in which it can be defined, including medical–biological, legal, social, bioethical, philosophical, religious, spiritual, and existential. Brain death as a criterion for determining the death of a person is a medicolegal and social formulation. It implies a notion of irreversible loss of personhood and integrative functions of the brain. The diagnosis uncovers cultural and religious diversity in a pluralistic society.\nThe concept of brain death was influenced by two major health care advances in the 1960s: the development of intensive care units, with artificial airways and mechanical ventilators to treat irreversible apnea, thus interrupting the natural evolution from brain failure to cardiac arrest, and the emergence of organ donation arising from the new discipline of transplant surgery.

The scarcity of organs is a major impetus behind the continuing search for, and development of, alternative ways to expand the pool of organs and tissues available for transplantation. A major development is the procurement of organs from family members, and most recently from friends and even from strangers. We are also witnessing desperate patients soliciting organs on the Internet, the compensation of living donors for related expenses or even the bestowing of financial rewards for donation, and the experimental use of organs from animals (i.e., xenotransplantation). These recent trends are at the forefront of current ethical debate on transplantation, and they are gaining varying levels of acceptance in different countries by both the public and the transplant community. The sale of organs is another highly complex subject that has received much attention"

    "text": "According to the source of the organ\nOrgan donation can be categorized based on the source of the organ, and there are various types of organ transplantation methods.\n\nHeterotransplantation, or xenotransplantation, is the practice of transplanting organs or tissues from one species to another.\n\nCross-Species Organ Transplants: Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs or tissues from animals (e.g., pigs) into humans to address the shortage of human organ donors.\nRisks of Disease Transmission: Critics argue that xenotransplantation may lead to the transmission of new viral diseases from animals to humans, posing ethical and public health concerns.\nLoss of Human Identity: Concerns exist about the psychological impact on recipients, as they may struggle with the idea of having animal organs. Pre- and post-operation counseling is seen as important to address these concerns.\nInformed Consent Challenges: Patients facing life-threatening situations may feel pressured to consent to xenotransplantation, raising questions about the validity of their consent.\nResource Allocation Dilemma: Xenotransplantation is expensive, and the allocation of resources in healthcare becomes an ethical issue, as it affects overall healthcare distribution.\nInstrumental Use of Animals: Using animals for organ transplantation should be justified based on aspects where humans are superior to animals. This raises questions about the ethics of using animals for the benefit of humans.\nAnimal Suffering: Donor animals may undergo increased suffering due to isolation and rigorous testing to prevent disease transmission. Genetic modifications are made to increase compatibility, further raising ethical concerns.\nBlurred Boundaries: Genetic alterations could make the boundary between humans and animals less distinct, challenging our understanding of species distinctions.\nDifferences Among Animals: Ethical perspectives differ on which animals are suitable donors. Some consider all animals equally acceptable, while others base acceptability on genetic similarity to humans.\n\nHomotransplantation / Allotransplantation:\n\nHomotransplantation, or allotransplantation, is the most common type of organ transplantation. It involves transplanting organs or tissues from one human to another of the same species.\nFor instance, a kidney transplant from a living or deceased human donor to a recipient is a common example of allotransplantation.\n\nIsotransplantation:\n\nIsotransplantation is a hypothetical term used to describe a situation where an organ or tissue is transplanted from one individual to another who is genetically identical.\nThis could occur, for example, in the case of an identical twin donating an organ to their sibling.\n\nAutotransplantation:\n\nAutotransplantation involves transplanting tissues or organs from one part of an individual’s body to another part of their own body.\nAn example of autotransplantation is a skin graft, where skin is taken from one area of a person’s body and transplanted to another area, often to treat burn injuries.\n\nBiotransplantation:\n\nBiotransplantation is a relatively uncommon term that can refer to any transplantation involving technologically modified tissues or organs or entirely artificial organs.\nFor example, a biotransplantation could involve transplanting a tissue or organ that has been modified using genetic engineering techniques or 3D bio-printing."

For example, ‘If you smoke, go to question 7; otherwise go to question 31’.\nMain/ Core questions: cover the research topic.\nIdentification: characterize the respondents by basic socio-demographic indicators and are placed at the end of the questionnaire.\nControl: to reveal the objectivity of the data.\n\nAccording to the formulation of the questions:\n\nStandard: in the form of interrogative sentences (direct or indirect).\nVisual: suitable for children or individuals with low literacy.\nScenario questions: present a situation and require an evaluation, attitude, or determination of a course of action.\nDialogue questions: presented as a dialogue and require expression of attitude, opinion, or evaluation.\nAssociative questions: respondents are asked to indicate in words what association certain words or concepts evoke.\n\nAccording to the expected answer:\n\nClosed-ended: pre-formulated responses; the respondent chooses an answer without expressing another opinion.\n\nLikert-type questions:\n\nResponses are formulated on a 5 or 7-point scale with a midpoint (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).\n4-point forced scale without a midpoint (e.g., strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree).\n\n2-point alternative scale: responses are only “yes” or “no.”\n\nWith one possible answer: processed quickly and easily.\nWith more than one answer: processed more slowly and with difficulty.\n\n\nOpen-ended: without pre-formulated responses; the respondent answers freely in their own words.\nSemi-closed: have pre-formulated responses but provide an opportunity to express another opinion.\n\nAccording to the collected information (subject area):\n\nObjective facts (factual).\nSubjective opinion, evaluation (evaluative)."

The respondents are gathered in one place and simultaneously fill out the distributed survey forms by hand.\nAdvantages:\n\nA large number of individuals can be surveyed in a short period.\nAllows for anonymity.\nRequires fewer interviewers.\nConvenient for working with formal groups during work or study hours.\nProvides a quick assessment of collective opinions.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nMany organizational and technical conditions need to be observed. All respondents must be gathered in one place at the same time.\nNot suitable for studying individuals not organized in groups.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Individual Survey\n\nDefinition: A form of inquiry where the respondent fills out the provided survey form by themselves, individually, rather than in a group setting. The interviewer is not required to be present during the completion.\nAdvantages:\n\nThe questionnaire reaches each individual designated for surveying.\nThe individual responds to the questions at their own convenience.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires more time to conduct the study.\nRaises doubts among respondents about anonymity.\nNot convenient for assessing knowledge.\nDifficult to control the behavior of the surveyed individuals.\n\n\n\n\nMail Survey / Online Survey\n\nDefinition: A form of surveying where the questionnaire reaches the surveyed individuals by mail (in an envelope, newspaper, or magazine) and is returned to the survey organizer by mail. With the online communication, its variation is used - the online survey: where a link is sent (published on social networks or via email), and the respondent answers at their convenience and through an electronic device.\nAdvantages:\n\nNo need for interviewers.\nThe respondent answers the questions in a familiar environment and at their convenience.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThere is low response rate. That can reduce the representativeness of the sample.\nNot suitable for surveys assessing knowledge, due to the possibility of external consultation.\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Survey = Structured Interview\n\nDefinition: A form of inquiry where the interviewer fills out the questionnaire themselves after gathering the necessary information from the individual by asking questions.\nAdvantages:\n\nProvides an opportunity to obtain information from all intended participants in the study.\nThe reliability of the information is higher as it is obtained from different sources.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires a large number of interviewers.\nInterviewers must have high general culture, work conscientiously, and responsibly.\nRequires prolonged time and financial resources."

This sociological method finds wide application in practice. However, it should be distinguished from its use in journalism, for conversation between an employer and a job candidate, between a lawyer and a client, as well as between a doctor and a patient. Taking medical history, which is the first stage of medical diagnosis, is actually an interview, where the interviewer is the doctor and the interviewee is the patient.\nCharacteristics:\n\nInformation about the elements of behavior and self-awareness of the subject is gathered during the meeting;\nThe questions and answers are recorded by the researcher;\nInterviewers need to possess certain psychological qualities and sociological training to create an atmosphere of trust and openness;\nIt allows for follow-up meetings.\n\nPreparatory steps - elements:\n\nDetermining the type of interview;\nChoosing the time and place for its conduct;\nDeveloping and testing the questionnaires;\nSelecting and training the interviewers."

However, the interviewer should guide and protect the interviewee from circumstantial and unnecessary answers.\nDuring the interview, it is necessary to start with general questions and gradually deepen the conversation topic according to the research objectives.\n\nThe renowned sociologist Albert has developed the following exemplary plan for gradually deepening the topic during the interview: the interviewer introduces themselves - name, profession, tasks, etc.; then asks about the interviewee’s age; traditions and upbringing, culture; education; illnesses and accidents; life plans, intentions in the profession field; hobbies and leisure activities; cultural interests; hopes and ambitions; personal attachment to men, women, animals, books, etc.; dreams; fears and concerns; humiliations and disappointments; dislikes and repulsions; intimate and sexual life; neuroticism and phobias; religiosity; worldview, life philosophy. This plan should be understood as an example, as an approach."

The exact wording of each question is selected beforehand and each participant is asked the same questions in the same order.\nUnstructured - Free interviews. Need have no agenda and no prearranged questions. The conversation can be allowed to take whatever path the participants find most interesting. In the context of research, however, the researcher is likely to have some preliminary ideas which will guide at least the initial questions. Nonetheless, he or she is not going to constrain the conversation.\nSemi-structured - Less formal. Here the questioner has an agenda: a specific topic to ask about and a set of questions which he or she wants answered. However, the exact wording of the questions is not considered critical and the order in which the questions are asked is not fixed. This allows the interview to flow more like a conversation. Nonetheless, the interviewer may have to steer the conversation back to the given topic and check that the original questions have been answered.\n\nAccording to the number of subjects studied:\n\nIndividual.\nCollective focus groups.\n\nIn this case, the focus is on a specific problem area, and the conversation is held not with one, but with several interviewees.\nThe topic, place, and time of the meeting are planned, and a script is prepared in advance. It includes introductory words on the topic, introduction of participants, the purpose of the discussion, and its subject.\nThe list of questions should contain several main questions, as well as supporting materials for illustration.\nThe discussions are led by a facilitator (moderator), who introduces topics and guides the discussion. The moderator should not evaluate the opinions of the interviewees. A co-moderator supervises the work in the focus group, assists, and intervenes if necessary, taking notes during the discussions.\nThe duration of the discussions is usually between one and a half to two hours. Typically, audio and video recordings are made of focus group discussions, and participants are informed in advance so they can decline participation.\nA group discussion is conducted with 8-12 people, discussing several main topics related to the research, monitoring, or evaluation being conducted.\nParticipants should not be in hierarchical or competitive relationships with each other, as this can block discussion. It is best if they do not know each other at all. Research tasks are transformed into a series of questions to be answered and discussed during the group work. This method establishes the typical attitudes and orientations of participants regarding the discussed issue.\n\n\nAccording to the frequency of conducting:\n\nSingle.\nMultiple.\n\nAccording to the method of conducting:\n\n“Face to face” - interviews involve the interviewer and participant being present together or, in the case of video link, able to see and hear each other in real time. The interviewer asks the questions and notes down the responses. Such interviews can occur in a number of places. They can be conducted:\n\non the interviewer’s territory, when participants visit the researcher’s place of work;\non the participant’s territory, when the interviewer visits the participant’s home or place of work; or\nwith each on his or her own territory via video link.\nFinally, they can be conducted on neutral territory such as outside a shop.\n\nRemote - Telephone; Online - Answers are immediately entered into a computer with specialized software for data processing and analysis."
