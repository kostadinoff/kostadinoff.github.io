<p>Sociological research serves as a crucial tool for the scientific management of healthcare. These studies not only help formulate and adopt optimal managerial decisions but also examine the mechanisms of their impact on people, their perception by various categories of medical professionals, track how these decisions are translated into people’s thoughts and behaviors, and how they influence relationships within work teams and social groups.</p>
<section id="purposes-of-social-research" class="level1">
<h1>Purposes of Social Research</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exploration - When we have a new or relatively underresearched topic, exploratory research is a way of learning about that topic. Exploratory research can help us fill a gap in our knowledge about a new or underresearched topic, or approach the topic from a different perspective to generate new and emerging insights. When you conduct a literature review and come up short, this absence of adequate research is often an indicator that exploratory research is needed. Such research may prompt further investigation, including the development of an appropriate methodological plan.</li>
<li>Description - When we want to describe individuals, groups, activities, events, or situations, descriptive research is appropriate. Descriptive research aims to generate “thick descriptions” of social life (those that provide details, meanings, and context), typically from the perspective of the people living it. Researchers may turn to rigorous observation or related methods of interview in order to document how things are experienced, with respect to the phenomenon under investigation.</li>
<li>Explanation - When we want to explain causes and effects, correlations, or why things are the way they are, explanatory research is appropriate. For example, if we want to know the particular factors that shape people’s attitudes about a controversial issue such as stem cell research, or immigration policies, we may conduct explanatory research. This type of research can also provide evidence for causal relationships, suggesting that A causes B, or that A causes B only under certain circumstances.<br>
</li>
<li>Community Change or Action - When relevant stakeholders have identified the need for community change or action, we may conduct research with the aim of prompting such community change, social action, or community intervention. For instance, if a community is undergoing rapid development and some stakeholders in the community are being excluded from the development process, we may develop a research project with the aim of intervening in that process.</li>
<li>Evaluation - When we want to assess the effectiveness or impact of a program or policy, evaluation research provides a means of doing so. Evaluation can be considered a type of explanation. Evaluation research is useful in numerous kinds of research projects, from evaluating particular outreach programs, educational programs, to public policies, campaigns of various sorts, and so forth. For instance, evaluation research can help us determine how changes in a policy have impacted successes or failures in a particular program or the effectiveness of a particular awareness campaign.</li>
<li>Evoke, Provoke, or Unsettle - When we want to jar specified audiences (groups of people) into thinking about or seeing something differently, promote new learning, or create an awareness campaign, we may conduct research with the aim of evoking, provoking, or unsettling. This kind of research may aim to disrupt or unsettle stereotypes or “commonsense” ideologies, serve as an intervention, stimulate self-reflection, or generate social awareness. Research conducted with this purpose may follow a generative model whereby the inquiry itself is the research act.</li>
</ol>

<section id="soc_applications" class="level1">
<h1>Application of the Sociological Approach in Social Medicine</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Study of the medical-social issues within the society (doctor-patient relationships, healthcare needs, satisfaction).</li>
<li>Investigation of the social cause-and-effect relationships between health status and social factors.</li>
<li>Development of various approaches for the management, governance, and functioning of healthcare services and the healthcare system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The utilization of sociological methods in social medicine for the purpose of gathering primary sociological information is referred to as <strong>empirical sociological research</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="soc_sources" class="level1">
<h1>Sources of Sociological Data:</h1>
<p>Sociological information can be gathered from three main sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the <em>researched individual and/or their close associates</em> - verbal information is collected (interview) or written information (survey).</li>
<li>Studying the <em>behavior</em> of the observed individual - visual or auditory data are collected.</li>
<li>Documents about and concerning the researched individual - written or other information is gathered through document analysis.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="esi_stages" class="level1">
<h1>Stages of Empirical Sociological Research:</h1>
<section id="preparation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>The preparation phase of sociological research is a crucial. It usually involves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formulating the problem through analysis of literary data.</li>
<li>Defining the topic and the purpose of the research (the topic should be clearly articulated).</li>
<li>Formulating the research tasks (detailed steps to achieve the goal).</li>
<li>Defining the research design (accurately determining the sample size to ensure statistically significant differences and conclusions).</li>
<li>Developing the research program (includes formulating hypotheses and developing a sociological model).</li>
<li>Organizational plan (involves accepting a schedule plan, selecting a research team, determining the necessary funding, and preparing the required documents for the research).</li>
<li>Pilot study among a small number of respondents, aimed at evaluating the questionnaire’s receptivity.</li>
<li>Refining the questionnaire and accepting its final version.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="conducting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conducting">Conducting</h2>
<p>This involves gathering data from the designated respondents. It is also known as “fieldwork.”</p>
</section>
<section id="data-processing-and-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-processing-and-analysis">Data Processing and Analysis</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Organization and presentation of data (calculating statistical properties such as the mean and the median, standard deviation, preparing tables, and graphs).</li>
<li>Data analysis (includes hypothesis testing, exploring trends, comparative analyses).</li>
<li>Interpretation of data (drawing conclusions to support or reject the hypotheses under study, identifying the need for future research).</li>
<li>Publishing the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>A key tool for conducting any sociological study is the preparation of a <strong>questionnaire</strong>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="survey" class="level1">
<h1>Questionnaire / Survey Form</h1>
<p>The questionnaire is a fundamental tool for collecting individual sociological information and is an essential component of any sociological study. It consists of building blocks - <strong>questions</strong>, reflecting specific characteristics of the researched individuals.</p>
<section id="types-of-questionnaires" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-questionnaires">Types of Questionnaires</h2>
<ul>
<li>Self-administered questionnaire;</li>
<li>Interview questionnaire;</li>
<li>Questionnaire/ Diaries for sociological observation;</li>
<li>Questionnaire for extracting information from documents.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="types-of-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-questions">Types of Questions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>According to their place in the questionnaire:
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Introductory</em>: placed at the beginning of the questionnaire, introducing the topic of the study and providing general information.</li>
<li><em>Filtering</em>: follow the introductory questions and divide the respondents into subgroups based on certain factors. Your sample may include people who will respond in some fundamentally difefrent ways and you may wish to explore those difefrences further. In this case, rather than ask inappropriate questions of some people you can include filter questions which guide people to the section which is appropriate for them. For example, ‘If you smoke, go to question 7; otherwise go to question 31’.</li>
<li><em>Main/ Core questions</em>: cover the research topic.</li>
<li><em>Identification</em>: characterize the respondents by basic socio-demographic indicators and are placed at the end of the questionnaire.</li>
<li><em>Control</em>: to reveal the objectivity of the data.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the formulation of the questions:
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Standard</em>: in the form of interrogative sentences (direct or indirect).</li>
<li><em>Visual</em>: suitable for children or individuals with low literacy.</li>
<li><em>Scenario questions</em>: present a situation and require an evaluation, attitude, or determination of a course of action.</li>
<li><em>Dialogue questions</em>: presented as a dialogue and require expression of attitude, opinion, or evaluation.</li>
<li><em>Associative questions</em>: respondents are asked to indicate in words what association certain words or concepts evoke.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the expected answer:
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Closed-ended</em>: pre-formulated responses; the respondent chooses an answer without expressing another opinion.
<ul>
<li><em>Likert-type questions</em>:
<ul>
<li>Responses are formulated on a 5 or 7-point scale with a midpoint (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).</li>
<li>4-point forced scale without a midpoint (e.g., strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>2-point alternative scale</em>: responses are only “yes” or “no.”
<ul>
<li><em>With one possible answer</em>: processed quickly and easily.</li>
<li><em>With more than one answer</em>: processed more slowly and with difficulty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Open-ended</em>: without pre-formulated responses; the respondent answers freely in their own words.</li>
<li><em>Semi-closed</em>: have pre-formulated responses but provide an opportunity to express another opinion.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the collected information (subject area):
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Objective facts</em> (factual).</li>
<li><em>Subjective opinion</em>, evaluation (evaluative).</li>
</ol></li>

<h1>Observation</h1>
<section id="definition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Observation is the recording of primary sociological information regarding specific social phenomena and processes from objective reality in real-time and space (the behaviour of the studied objects) in accordance with the research program. It is carried out using specific methodology. Participant observation always takes place in community settings, in locations believed to have some relevance to the research questions. The method is distinctive because the researcher approaches participants in their own environment rather than having the participants come to the researcher. Generally speaking, the researcher engaged in participant observation tries to learn what life is like for an “insider” while remaining, inevitably, an “outsider”. In the community setting, the researcher makes careful, objective notes about what he sees, recording all accounts and observations as field notes in a field notebook. Informal conversation and interaction with members of the study population are also important components of the method and should be recorded in the field notes, in as much detail as possible.</p>

<li>According to the conditions under which the observation is conducted:
<ol type="1">
<li>In natural conditions (home, workplace).</li>
<li>In laboratory conditions (hospital, atypical and new places for the individual).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the degree of anonymity:
<ol type="1">
<li>Overt observation.</li>
<li>Covert observation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the type of behavior studied:
<ol type="1">
<li>Non-verbal behavior.</li>
<li>Verbal behavior.</li>
<li>Simulation of predetermined actions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the frequency:
<ol type="1">
<li>Single-time.</li>
<li>Multiple-time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the use of technical means:
<ol type="1">
<li>Without technical means.</li>
<li>Audio observation.</li>
<li>Video observation.</li>
<li>Combined.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the researcher’s level of involvement
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>complete participant</strong>, the role as an observer might be hidden from the other participant;</li>
<li><strong>complete observer</strong>, who does not participate at all and whose role is also kept from the people who are being observed. An example of the first could be a researcher who covertly joins an organisation to observe it from within.</li>
<li><strong>participant-as-observer</strong>, which, as the name suggests, involves researchers taking part in the activity to be observed but revealing that they are researchers.</li>
<li><strong>marginal participant</strong>: researchers might have taken steps, such as wearing particular clothing, in order to be unobtrusive.</li>
<li><strong>observer-as- participant</strong>: researchers would reveal the fact that they were observing but not participating directly in the action being observed.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Level at which the behaviour is being observed and recorded.
<ol type="1">
<li>Molar behaviour refers to larger-scale behaviour such as greeting a person who enters the room; this level of observation can involve interpretation by the observer as to the nature of the behaviour.</li>
<li>Molecular behaviour refers to the components which make up molar behaviour, and is less likely to involve interpretation. For example, a molecular description of the behaviour described earlier as greeting a person who enters the room might be stated thus: ’<em>extends hand to newcomer; grips newcomer’s hand and shakes it; turns corners of mouth up and makes eye contact, briefly; lets go of newcomer’s hand’</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A further way of classifying observation depends on the degree to which the nature of the observation is predetermined. This can range from what is termed
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>informal or casual observation</strong></li>
<li><strong>formal or systematic observation</strong>.</li>

<h1>Interview</h1>
<section id="definition-and-preparation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition-and-preparation">Definition and Preparation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Definition: An interview is a form of inquiry based on direct <strong>verbal</strong> communication between two or more individuals through oral questioning and responses. This sociological method finds wide application in practice. However, it should be distinguished from its use in journalism, for conversation between an employer and a job candidate, between a lawyer and a client, as well as between a doctor and a patient. Taking medical history, which is the first stage of medical diagnosis, is actually an interview, where the interviewer is the doctor and the interviewee is the patient.</li>
<li>Characteristics:
<ol type="1">
<li>Information about the elements of behavior and self-awareness of the subject is gathered during the meeting;</li>
<li>The questions and answers are recorded by the researcher;</li>
<li>Interviewers need to possess certain psychological qualities and sociological training to create an atmosphere of trust and openness;</li>
<li>It allows for follow-up meetings.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Preparatory steps - elements:
<ol type="1">
<li>Determining the type of interview;</li>
<li>Choosing the time and place for its conduct;</li>
<li>Developing and testing the questionnaires;</li>
<li>Selecting and training the interviewers.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="requirements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The interviewee should not feel like they are being interrogated; it is necessary to gain their trust.</li>
<li>During the conversation, the interviewee’s opinions and beliefs should not be criticized, nor should they be lectured. However, the interviewer should guide and protect the interviewee from circumstantial and unnecessary answers.</li>
<li>During the interview, it is necessary to start with general questions and gradually deepen the conversation topic according to the research objectives.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The renowned sociologist Albert has developed the following exemplary plan for gradually deepening the topic during the interview: the interviewer introduces themselves - name, profession, tasks, etc.; then asks about the interviewee’s age; traditions and upbringing, culture; education; illnesses and accidents; life plans, intentions in the profession field; hobbies and leisure activities; cultural interests; hopes and ambitions; personal attachment to men, women, animals, books, etc.; dreams; fears and concerns; humiliations and disappointments; dislikes and repulsions; intimate and sexual life; neuroticism and phobias; religiosity; worldview, life philosophy. This plan should be understood as an example, as an approach.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="types-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-1">Types</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>According to the type of questionnaire used:
<ol type="1">
<li>Structured standard with a questionnaire form - The most formal format is a questionnaire. The exact wording of each question is selected beforehand and each participant is asked the same questions in the same order.</li>
<li>Unstructured - Deep interviews. Need have no agenda and no prearranged questions. The conversation can be allowed to take whatever path the participants find most interesting. In the context of research, however, the researcher is likely to have some preliminary ideas which will guide at least the initial questions. Nonetheless, he or she is not going to constrain the conversation. The qualitative in - depth interview is a favored strategy of data collection in qualitative research and produces rich data. It is a ‘conversation with a purpose’ in which the interviewer aims to obtain the perspectives, feelings and perceptions from the participants in the research. The in - depth interview is a technique designed to elicit a vivid picture of the participant’s perspective on the research topic. During in - depth interviews, the person being interviewed is considered the expert and the interviewer is considered the student. The researcher’s interviewing techniques are motivated by the desire to learn everything the participant can share about the research topic. Researchers engage with participants by posing questions in a neutral manner, listening attentively to participant’s responses, and asking follow - up questions and probes based on those responses. They do not lead participants according to any preconceived notions, nor do they encourage participants to provide particular answers by expressing approval or disapproval of what they say. In - depth interviews are usually conducted face - to - face and involve one interviewer and one participant. The details of conducting interviews have already been covered in detail in an earlier chapter and the readers are advised to go through the same.</li>
<li>Semi-structured - Less formal. Here the questioner has an agenda: a specific topic to ask about and a set of questions which he or she wants answered. However, the exact wording of the questions is not considered critical and the order in which the questions are asked is not fixed. This allows the interview to flow more like a conversation. Nonetheless, the interviewer may have to steer the conversation back to the given topic and check that the original questions have been answered.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the number of subjects studied:
<ol type="1">
<li>Individual.</li>
<li>Collective – focus groups discussion is a qualitative data collection method effective in helping researchers learn the social norms of a community or subgroup, as well as the range of perspectives that exist within that community or subgroup. Focus groups seek to illuminate group opinion. This method is especially well suited for socio-behavioural research that will be used to develop and measure health services that meet the needs of a given population. An FGD requires the following :
<ol type="1">
<li>The focus is on a specific problem area, and the conversation is held not with one, but with several interviewees.</li>
<li>These participants should be as homogenous as possible with respect to their background characteristics.</li>
<li>There is a moderator conducting the discussion but not leading the discussion.</li>
<li>The topic, place, and time of the meeting are planned, and a script is prepared in advance. It includes introductory words on the topic, introduction of participants, the purpose of the discussion, and its subject.</li>
<li>The list of questions should contain several main questions, as well as supporting materials for illustration.</li>
<li>The discussions are led by a facilitator (moderator), who introduces topics and guides the discussion. The moderator should not evaluate the opinions of the interviewees. A co-moderator supervises the work in the focus group, assists, and intervenes if necessary, taking notes during the discussions.</li>
<li>The duration of the discussions is usually between one and a half to two hours. Typically, audio and video recordings are made of focus group discussions, and participants are informed in advance so they can decline participation.</li>
<li>A group discussion is conducted with <strong>8-12</strong> people, discussing several main topics related to the research, monitoring, or evaluation being conducted.</li>
<li>Participants should not be in hierarchical or competitive relationships with each other, as this can block discussion. It is best if they do not know each other at all. Research tasks are transformed into a series of questions to be answered and discussed during the group work. This method establishes the typical attitudes and orientations of participants regarding the discussed issue.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the frequency of conducting:
<ol type="1">
<li>Single (one-time).</li>
<li>Multiple.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>According to the method of conducting:
<ol type="1">
<li>“Face to face” - interviews involve the interviewer and participant being present together or, in the case of video link, able to see and hear each other in real time. The interviewer asks the questions and notes down the responses. Such interviews can occur in a number of places. They can be conducted:
<ol type="1">
<li>on the interviewer’s territory, when participants visit the researcher’s place of work;</li>
<li>on the participant’s territory, when the interviewer visits the participant’s home or place of work; or</li>
<li>with each on his or her own territory via video link.</li>
<li>Finally, they can be conducted on neutral territory such as outside a shop.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Remote - Telephone; Online - Answers are immediately entered into a computer with specialized software for data processing and analysis.</li>
