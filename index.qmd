<br>

I’m Dr. Kostadin Kostadinov, a medical doctor, Senior Assistant Professor and researcher in the Department of Social Medicine and Public Health at the Medical University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

I hold an MD and PhD, as well as an MPH from MU–Plovdiv. I also completed an MSc in Economics and Finance at Sofia University and an MBA in Statistics from the D. A. Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svishtov. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Policy Analysis at Sofia University.

I am the founder of the Social Epidemiology Lab, a private research company dedicated to advancing evidence-based approaches in social medicine, public health, and health policy.

My academic and professional interests focus on data science, epidemiology, policy evaluation, and health services research.

This website serves as a space to share my research projects, 15-minute learning materials, learning tasks, and reflections on public health and social epidemiology.
All learning and task materials are developed in collaboration with my colleagues, although I bear full responsibility for any errors or omissions.

All opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of any affiliated institution or organization.
